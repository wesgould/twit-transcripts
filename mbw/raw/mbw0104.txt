[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.680]   And we are gathered around to talk about all things Mac
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.680]   with Scott Born, who's almost out of here.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.720]   He's going to go up to shoot grizzlies with his camera
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.040]   in a few hours.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.880]   Scott Born, hello.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.400]   Glad to be on the show with my friends as always.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.160]   Yeah, we're glad to have you.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.080]   I am saying that today is a sad day for me because in a
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.360]   world where there's no Don La Fontaine.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.200]   It's not a good world anymore.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.400]   Yeah, we're going to talk about that.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.320]   I don't know if it's Mac news, but it certainly
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.680]   news everybody has some.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.560]   He used a Mac.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.600]   Feeling about mom, sure he did.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.160]   I know he did.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.880]   Merlin Mann is also here, not busy not answering anybody's
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.200]   email.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.720]   Hello, if it weren't for that, he wouldn't be here.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.880]   Yes, and last, the secret to inbox zero is cracked.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.760]   Just so just break over the slot in your letter box.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.560]   Hey, what do you know?
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.680]   You're on top of your mail.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.520]   Don't beat up in Merlin.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.800]   He's been gone for a few weeks.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.160]   He's never been come back.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.720]   Are you there, Merlin?
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.240]   Certainly I'm.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.000]   It's very nice to be back.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.640]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.200]   We missed you.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.360]   And as a new, you look nice today out.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.760]   Oh, is there?
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.280]   Did it go up?
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.840]   You know, I listen, I listen to that show for the first time
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.280]   I have to admit it's really funny, but a lot of the humor
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.480]   goes over my head as I'm I'm sure you're aware of.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.600]   You have to start with episode one.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.360]   It was over my head, too.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.760]   I have Adam explained it to me later.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.480]   If you go if you go back to episode one, then you will.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.440]   That was my mistake.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.520]   I did not come in on it, but it's really quite funny.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.000]   Congratulations.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.960]   Oh, I love it.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.760]   I think it's my favorite podcast.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.880]   And it's there are special outtakes on the website, too,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.280]   I'm told.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.200]   You know, I this is we have people to do this.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.080]   We have we have a sandwich does it all.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.360]   He's busy not answering email.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.640]   I've got a sandwich.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.160]   I've got a sandwich.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.400]   I've got playing you, Merlin is impeccable.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   Oh, he's so good.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.040]   The Italian accent is just adds that little sussion of--
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.120]   I'm so sorry.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.640]   I'm so sorry.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.760]   But this is the guy who brought the word prednisone
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.000]   back into mainstream use.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.560]   And I'm glad for that.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   So he's here.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.280]   He's with us.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.720]   What's his name?
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.160]   His name is Carl Van Hoot.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.240]   And it's a ligature.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.240]   Yeah, it's a very difficult name to pronounce.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.200]   It might be Dutch.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   Van Hoot.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.680]   I think this might be the episode where
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.800]   Carl gets in trouble at work.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.480]   I'm not sure.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.920]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.320]   And of course, from the colossal celestial waste of bandwidth
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.800]   and the Chicago Sun times Andy Enochko from his home.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.680]   Yes.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.200]   His new palatial home, his Twitter home.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.080]   Intergalactic headquarters, yes.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.400]   Right now, for the moment, it's the ethereal waste of bandwidth
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.440]   because I'm right in the middle of moving an octo.com
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.960]   to a new server.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.040]   I'm at that stage in the transition where you're just
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.400]   saying, you know what?
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.480]   You know, this goal, this goal, this goal, and this goal,
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.440]   what if we just take those right off the whiteboard?
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.120]   How easy would it be then?
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.760]   Answer.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.880]   Pretty damn easy, Andy.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.160]   OK, dokey.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.400]   So what you're saying is you're stuck in the cloud right now,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.240]   somewhere somewhere in the cloud.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.720]   Right now, unfortunately, my days of watching Star Trek
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.080]   are so far behind me.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.520]   I know that we're maintaining his holding pattern
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.360]   in a reciprocal loop or something in the--
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.720]   you know, where they're--
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.240]   Yeah, where they're kind of-- they only do the transporter--
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.800]   the transporter halfway, right?
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   And then he's kind of stuck.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.360]   Just take this hold and then say, you know what?
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.000]   It's their--
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.760]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.560]   Basically, it came from--
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.440]   I made the really radical and out there decision
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.720]   to change the URL from an octo.com to www.anautgo.com.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.240]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.600]   That's going to break everything.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.960]   I know.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.200]   Well, I mean, that's what we're hoping for like web 3.0.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.160]   We're hoping-- it's sort of like throwing my cap over the wall
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.880]   like Kennedy did in 1959 at Rice University saying,
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.400]   you know what?
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.200]   If I simply declare that we're going to land on the moon in 1969,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.280]   that's going to cause the technology to spur forward
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.680]   to make this arbitrary deadline.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.360]   And I'm convinced--
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.000]   Someday before this decade is out,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.080]   www will be at all websites.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.560]   I don't know.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.080]   Wait, Joe?
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.240]   I thought it was going to be the other way around.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.120]   Joe's to move to a new server.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.880]   Say Joe's to move to a new server and do the other things,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.040]   not because it is easy, but because it is hard.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.080]   A new generation has stepped forth.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.280]   All right, enough of it.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.760]   It's been on webmaster.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.400]   Let's-- we're going to take a little break for Visa.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.280]   Then we're going to do a little tribute to Don La Fontaine.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.480]   And we'll tell you who he is for those of few of you who don't know.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.160]   But first, I want to mention this is brought to you.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.480]   As always, by the great folks at Visa,
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.680]   when you go online to shop or actually when you're
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.760]   doing any kind of buy-in, you might want to make sure you take
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.840]   along that Visa card.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.520]   Visa makes your purchases safe and secure.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.960]   Visa has very sophisticated technology
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.560]   that makes sure that every purchase you make is protected.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.800]   They have technology to detect, prevent, and ultimately,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.840]   if there are problems resolved online fraud.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.800]   And man, what a great track record.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.920]   I hear so many people send me their emails now saying, yes, it
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.280]   works.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.800]   It's true.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.840]   You're not kidding.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.160]   Visa stood by me.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.920]   Two things to remember-- zero liability when you shop online
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.720]   with your Visa card.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.440]   Make sure you take it along with you.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.640]   Safe, secure, Visa.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.720]   Now, that's peace of mind.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.400]   We thank him so much for their support.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.960]   I wish I could have done that in a Don La Fontaine voice.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.280]   In a land where Leo forgot his Visa.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   So who, Scott Bourne, did you know Don La Fontaine?
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.880]   You knew everybody in the business.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.200]   I met him, and I was on a couple of panels with him
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.920]   at RAB Radio Advertising Bureau marketing things,
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.440]   and a heck of a nice guy.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.160]   So I'm using a Mac laptop once.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.880]   I can't say for a fact that he was a full-time Mac user,
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.720]   but I did see him using a Mac laptop.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.200]   He wasn't the most--
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.440]   the beginning of his career, he wasn't as obviously involved
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.080]   with computers.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   So computers was a slower uptake for him, I think.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.280]   But for him, it just didn't matter.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.920]   It was the voice.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.160]   The guy had the voice.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.680]   And I've been lucky enough to work
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.480]   with some big voices in the business.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.400]   Obviously, he's the best, and he moved over
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.640]   to doing the movie trailers.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.200]   And that was all she wrote.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.520]   He sealed the deal there and made enough money
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.200]   to retire a long time ago.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.840]   If you go to his website, actually,
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.880]   you can hear a little bit of him.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.200]   I think his reel is online.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.880]   Let me see if I can download that.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.360]   He is a guy who said in a world where--
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.800]   That's him.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.200]   He's the guy-- he would do--
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.000]   his primary, lately, the last few years,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.720]   he was really well-known for doing the movie trailers.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.520]   He had most of the big ones all locked up.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.760]   And he made just tons of money.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.840]   I mean, he was not cheap.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.160]   I'm not going to disclose the price.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.320]   I happen to know what it is.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.520]   And let me tell you something.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.640]   You'd be feeling real happy to get that for a voice over.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.320]   $20,000?
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.840]   $30,000?
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.280]   I'm just going to say it's a whole great big bunch.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.720]   A lot of Alex's?
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.640]   A whole bunch of Alex's.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.320]   You were saying, Merlin, that this is a guy who
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.800]   had time management down.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.040]   I think he did.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.400]   I mean, one of the things--
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.840]   if I'm remembering the right guy-- and I think I am--
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.200]   there was a documentary about him a while back that showed
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.840]   how he basically had a limo that would drive him all over New
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.480]   York.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.120]   He had this incredibly efficient schedule.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.000]   But then I SDN came along.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.120]   And it changed everything because he could do it all
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.720]   from his house.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.920]   He had a studio in his pen house or whatever.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.640]   And he could do these amazing trailers.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.760]   And Shree charged a lot, but he was also--
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   he was a "the voice."
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And he was a pro.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.160]   And I also think it's a great example of figuring out,
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.200]   instead of trying to be something that a million other people
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.160]   do, figure out the one thing you can be totally awesome at,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.760]   and then get better at it than everybody else.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.920]   It's totally inspiring.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.880]   Let's play a little bit of Don LaFontaine, just
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.440]   in case you haven't heard his voice.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.920]   I think I can get this from his website.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.480]   Oh, man.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.280]   It's not coming up.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.400]   Maybe because Don's been silenced, his website
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.560]   has also been silenced.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.160]   Go to them.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.920]   I think on the front page of Current TV,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.560]   one of the tops where I saw it, one of the top--
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.000]   one of the top--
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.760]   There are probably a lot of people
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.360]   hitting the site is probably what's going on.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.600]   It's funny because you don't normally
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.240]   think of these voiceover guys as being well known at all.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.400]   Go to current.tv, current.com.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.880]   And the top leftmost link will take you to a YouTube video.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.400]   OK.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.000]   Yeah, I'm sure YouTube has a lot of Don LaFontaine.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.760]   I think it might be a self-promotion thing.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.760]   Anyway, it's not really Mac news.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.280]   But it was something we were all kind of thinking about.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.440]   Well, this does kind of open the door now for Joe
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.520]   Sipriano.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.720]   That's Joe Sip is the guy we know from a podcast Expo.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.400]   He does a podcast stuff.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.080]   But he's a Don LaFontaine quality Vio guy who does the law
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.040]   on order voiceover.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.200]   He does a lot of stuff for the national TV networks.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.480]   And he's done several tutorials for Apple.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.280]   Well, and I also think that there are a lot of guys
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.240]   who are jockeying to get in position for this.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.280]   Because Jim Cutler, who does our own--
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.200]   this is Twit stuff--
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.680]   is also very, very well known.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.360]   Did all the tech TV stuff.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.480]   And then there's people like Peter Coyote, who's an actor,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.240]   but who also does voiceover work in Hollywood.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.360]   And there's over a lot of guys out there
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.880]   who probably would love to fill in his shoes.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.560]   But it's pretty tough shoes to fill.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   Top Mac news, I guess.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.400]   No rumors yet-- or no word yet from the rumor
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.240]   was September 9th.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.200]   We'd all be getting an invitation from Apple for an event.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.160]   I've seen faked invitations.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.840]   But I haven't--
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.960]   I just came in.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.560]   Please join Apple for a special event, September 9th.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.240]   Let's rock.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.240]   Let's rock.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.680]   Let's go.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.600]   The event has been pre-rated at five stars on the iPod,
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.640]   apparently.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.560]   Yes, I see that.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.440]   A little bit of confidence there.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.000]   Like to see that confidence.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.120]   So this is actually legitimate.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.440]   This came from Apple, RSVP, Apple Media.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.680]   Of course, I'm going to be in Los Angeles that day.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.200]   Please join us at the-- oh, it's a big one.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.600]   Erba Buena Center for the Arts.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.040]   We're not talking about Cupertino for this one.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.840]   Registration begins at 9 arrive early for this invitation-only
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.040]   event.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.240]   I take it, Andy, you're not going to go.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.440]   I, unfortunately, am when locked here in New England.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.160]   If I had the travel budget that I think I deserve,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.400]   I would be at Google today, you know,
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.360]   getting a pre-brief on the new browser.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.520]   And then I'd be heading to San Francisco next week
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.640]   to take a look at this.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   Unfortunately, alas, I have to actually save my money.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.760]   So this came into my inbox about an hour ago.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.640]   And I guess I was just too busy looking at other stuff.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.920]   Two hours ago, exactly now.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.720]   Let's rock September 9, 2008.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.480]   So in it's an iPod-- you know, the guy's holding an iPod.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.800]   So it's clearly an iPod announcement.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.480]   Right.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.840]   But you see, what you see here is essentially an iPod screen
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.520]   with the invite written on it.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.080]   And, you know, so he's pink transitioning into magenta.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.560]   Those of you who want to get the information on your blogs
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.360]   faster than the other guy.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.560]   So those of you who have pink transitioning to magenta
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.240]   on the rumor sites yesterday.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.560]   Well done.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.600]   You were right.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.040]   So unfortunately, our tape dates moved to Tuesday.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.120]   And Apple's now doing this Tuesday at 10 AM.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.880]   We might still be able to do a show right afterwards,
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.880]   I guess, we'll do a show and get it out that Tuesday.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.760]   But I will be in LA.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.680]   So I'll have to coordinate you with you guys.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.520]   I'm stuck doing another event, unfortunately,
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.400]   for that on that day.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.640]   I'll have to coordinate with you guys for a special--
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.880]   next week, a special edition of Mac Break Weekly
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.080]   so that we can cover whatever these announcements are.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:47.040]   Any final thoughts before next week?
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.320]   Ah, gee, usually when Apple has something really earth
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.480]   shattering, they're a little bit cute about the invitation.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.360]   So if there's something that we just were not expecting,
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.880]   that's really going to get the blood pumping next week.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.960]   I think it would be next week, Apple puts clouds in your pocket.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.880]   Or next week, the lollipop will not longer be cherry.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.520]   Yeah, not one of those this time.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   So it's pretty obvious.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.680]   It's iPods.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   An iPod that looks a lot like the Zoom, frankly.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.800]   If one rumor is true.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.400]   I think it's true.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.480]   I think that--
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.080]   It's a rumor.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.000]   What's that for?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.880]   It's Kevin Rose published it, although I see the eye lounge
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.760]   predicted this in July.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.560]   Kevin Rose, though, had an actual picture of it,
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.160]   a extended extruded nano with a wide screen
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.760]   that would be about the size of the solid state zoom
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.080]   with a somewhat bigger screen.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.080]   And I think it was very-- the document I saw was very credible.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.880]   Mm.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.520]   So yeah, I think we're going to see it.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.600]   We raised some issues last week about being a little reflective,
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.680]   maybe.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.080]   But--
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.600]   Is it the idea there would be--
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   you think that it's something that's really
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.720]   designed to watch movies on?
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.960]   Is that the idea?
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.160]   It's better than the old nano.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.560]   I don't know.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.280]   It's still not as big as the touch.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:18.240]   I think we'll imagine a screen the size of an iPod classic only.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.200]   It's that with only an HD form factor.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.320]   And instead of being vertical, it's horizontal.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.840]   You think it's not much bigger than that?
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.440]   If it's a nano, then it looks like a natural extension,
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   a way of making the nano into a more credible device
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.640]   for watching video.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.360]   Because the current version is very, very--
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.840]   it's a nice compromise between having something that's
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.960]   lightweight enough to wear in a strap on your arm
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.160]   while you're running and having enough detail.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.360]   But it's still a pretty small screen
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.560]   if you're having it horizontal left to right
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.920]   as you hold the iPod up.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.880]   This one, it would seem as--
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.520]   if this picture is, in fact, the real goods,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.640]   the idea would be that when it's time to watch a video,
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.720]   you turn it on its side and then use that wide screen aspect
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.360]   ratio.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.040]   And it would also make sense.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.800]   It's actually if this is true again.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.360]   It's actually sort of a clever idea
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.160]   because you get the wide screen aspect ratio
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.760]   when you're watching videos.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   But it also means that when you are using the standard iPod
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.840]   user interface where you're just scrolling top to bottom,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.240]   each list of items is long-- you can see more items at once.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.120]   So it's not one of those designs where you see,
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.200]   like, oh, for God's sakes.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.520]   Here are nine reasons why Steve Jobs would never
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.080]   approve a design like this.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.960]   This is a design that says, you know what?
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.480]   It's credible.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.480]   We won't know until the ninth.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.280]   But it's a credible design.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.640]   Yeah, I think this is just judging again
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.640]   from the documents I've seen.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.720]   I think this is probably pretty accurate.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.600]   Now I see on Twitter that Kevin is also
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.640]   saying the new iTunes 8 visualizations are really
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.520]   trippy, man.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.560]   So I guess he's got to look at iTunes 8 as well.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.240]   Here's what I don't understand.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.720]   Kevin consistently purports to have
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.080]   all these advanced looks at things.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.120]   Apple's proclivity for keeping things secret
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.240]   seems to bounce against that pretty hard.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.520]   Either they're leaking things through him on purpose
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.440]   or he must be pissing somebody off.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.960]   Well, I'll tell you where I think what's
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.080]   I think is happening.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.440]   Remember, as kind of the titular head of Dig,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.240]   I think he is the focus for a lot of people
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.240]   sending him leaked stuff.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.080]   And that's what he said.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.960]   He said, I get a ton of rumors, most of which I ignore.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.560]   But this one seemed so credible because of the document
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.720]   that was attached that he said I had to publish it.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.120]   I really think it's true.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.760]   So it makes sense, Scott, that if you wanted to leak it,
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.200]   you'd go to Kevin, right?
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.160]   You'd kind of want to--
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.680]   I know.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.600]   I guess what I'm trying to say is that why does an Apple just
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.240]   come out and say, we're not going
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.040]   to be secretive anymore and stop needing to leak it and just
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.400]   issue a press release like everybody else?
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:52.960]   I'll tell you why.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.440]   Don't they get a lot of comment and bounce from this?
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.960]   Yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.120]   I mean, it was one of those rhetorical questions.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.000]   Yeah, I keep thinking, though, I'm sorry.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.120]   I just think the current state of iPod-ness is great.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.320]   I don't know that we need another iPod, but that's just me.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.200]   I would sure love to get a new heir.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.480]   I would-- exactly.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.120]   I would rather see the upgrade to the airline,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.440]   upgrade the MacBook Pros getting a little long in the tooth.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.840]   I realize we ought to probably wait on the new processors
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.680]   or which won't be out till first quarter.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   But I think those things will be a little more sexy.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.840]   The Mac Pro has had nothing but basic processor upgrades,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.600]   speed upgrades for a while.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.440]   I mean, we haven't seen a lot of movement there.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.200]   It just seems like a new iPod.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.760]   Of course, I guess my expectations
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.640]   are high given that the iPhone, when
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.880]   it first launched, was sort of a radical new thing.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.080]   And we haven't seen much in the way
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.440]   of radical new things since.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:52.940]   Right.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.400]   Hey, can I do that speculation thing
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.520]   that you guys like to do?
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.000]   You guys keep talking about our Alex in particular.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.720]   Keeps talking about this tablet or whatever thing that's
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.560]   going to come out.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.080]   If Fast is Prolog, and it's fair to say
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.160]   that Apple was great a company as it is.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.000]   Apple is a company that can't do five new initiatives
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.160]   well at the same time.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.640]   And we assume a certain amount of resource constraint.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.360]   What does a new iPod tell you about whether you're
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.320]   beloved tablets coming out?
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.560]   I think if they were going to announce a tablet,
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.160]   it would be at this event, wouldn't it?
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.660]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.720]   And I'm just saying based on what we can guess,
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.440]   it's just interesting to me.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.840]   It just seems to me like there's really--
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.000]   there's only so much-- there's so many hours in a day at Apple.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.600]   And as we've seen recently, they're
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.760]   starting to hurt a little bit when they try to do more than one
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.320]   major thing.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.680]   And I'm just saying, having a whole lot of new hardware
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.160]   coming out is a lot of resources.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.340]   So does that change anybody's prediction
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.360]   about whether this faunted half-screen tablet things
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.160]   coming soon?
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.280]   Does Andy-- and it's not like Andy thought he had some--
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.280]   it sounded to me like Andy was stopping just short of saying,
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.800]   I know that this is coming out, but I can't say.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.720]   No, that wasn't-- that's what I was saying.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.760]   I'm certain that it makes a lot of sense for Apple
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.560]   to extend the touch interface line
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.520]   by coming out with a larger device.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.600]   However, there's going to be so many really
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.720]   incontrovertible markers that come out before that thing comes out.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.760]   I mean, they'd have to really start talking to developers
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.200]   about, OK, here's what we think you should do
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.080]   if hypothetically we gave you a larger screen.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.280]   So really, it's more of a WWDC kind of announcement.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:34.760]   Exactly.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.520]   I mean, just like with the iPhone developer kit,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.840]   you have to get-- you have to front load this device
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.680]   with all the applications that are going to make it credible.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.520]   Unless they-- just like with the iPhone,
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.520]   they want to say, you know what?
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.360]   We're going to give you a collection of applications
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.200]   for this new device that makes so such a perfect sense
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.440]   that you're not going to miss third party software so much.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.600]   Or at least, you're not going to--
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.800]   it's going to be OK that you wait three, four months for it.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.200]   I don't think that-- I think that this is coming eventually.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.000]   I don't think we're going to see it in 2008.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.880]   I think there's maybe a possibility
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.680]   that we'll see a sneak preview of it in January.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.240]   But I'm not-- I would be thinking more like the end of next year
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.320]   for a release at the earliest.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.520]   Because this is the perfect-- oh, my god.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.960]   That's totally what I want for school.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.360]   Oh, my god.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.400]   That's totally what I want for Christmas or for Hanukkah
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.120]   or for whatever.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.080]   So I think--
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.920]   It sounds like we're going to see new iPods next week.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.360]   I think Mac World for new power books--
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.520]   or I'm sorry, Mac Books and Airs.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.200]   And then sometime in June, maybe at WWDC,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.800]   an announcement that we've got a tablet in the works
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.040]   and get to work developers.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.640]   Does that seem reasonable?
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.960]   I think that's a pretty reasonable timeline there, Leo.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.280]   Based on what we just said.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.120]   That makes sense.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.440]   I mean, if I understand what you're just saying,
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.400]   and you're saying, don't dangle this thing out there
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.480]   that's going to make people think twice about picking up
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.000]   Macbook or something?
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.680]   Well, chiefly that you certainly don't want to--
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.320]   anything that they announce next week
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.320]   is all about selling another $40 million
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.960]   of whatever it is before Christmas,
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.280]   because that's a huge, huge selling season.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.480]   You certainly don't want to tease anybody in September
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.880]   with something that's not going to be available until January
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.200]   or February that we might cause them to, you know what?
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.040]   Maybe I'm not going to buy an iPod Touch.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.520]   Maybe I'm not going to buy a new iPod this season
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.880]   and hold off till then.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.320]   But mostly, it's because--
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.160]   I don't think it certainly isn't a trivial exercise
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.480]   to make a new, larger screen Touch device.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.520]   Because, again, Apple is not in the business of saying,
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.680]   well, let's just put a GSM radio set inside the iPod
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.840]   and call it the iPhone.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.640]   That's not what they do.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.360]   They're more like, OK, let's say we
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.400]   wanted to take all the good ideas from the iPod
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.600]   and put them into a phone.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.680]   What does that mean?
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   What does that suggest?
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.200]   And that's the same thing that we'd
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.600]   have to do to a tablet device.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.760]   Because right now, I was talking about this last week, too.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.760]   They own the idea of multi-touch, really touch computing
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.480]   in general, just like they used to own the concept of GUI
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.840]   based operating systems.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.680]   So right now, they got the ball and it's theirs to drop.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.400]   When do they announce new Mac Pros?
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.680]   What event--
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.360]   NAB is coming up in September.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.800]   Maybe NAB, although Apple wasn't there last year.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.240]   Maybe--
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.760]   Yeah, I don't think they got plans to attend.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.480]   See, that's the natural place to announce something
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.640]   like the Pro, which is really to use by designers and--
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.840]   They could do it at PMA in March.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.160]   And they could also do it at Photokina.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.320]   Focusing on the photo, folks.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.520]   Yeah, I mean, they've made big announcements
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.360]   around those product lines.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.160]   Maybe they just--
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.600]   Photo down.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.120]   Maybe they figure we don't need to make a big announcement
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:33.480]   about this.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.040]   It's not a consumer device.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.320]   Yeah, the Pro line is a different thing.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.760]   They know that the people who are--
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.680]   Proising a find out.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:40.560]   Exactly.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.720]   I mean, they got the money.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   They have to know far enough advance
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.200]   so they can set their budgets and set--
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.640]   because they set their permissions,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.720]   or set their permissions.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.240]   You can tell I've been doing with file management.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.880]   777.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.600]   What is that song we want to do?
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.120]   644 and don't be late.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.600]   All right, 777.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   You never get to heaven.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.920]   I'm talking about the IT managers who have to say,
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.400]   you know what?
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.920]   We're going to need to buy 500 new whatever
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.080]   it is next next year.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.080]   So we've got to make sure we know exactly what we're buying
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.400]   so we can start making the case that we need these things.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.240]   So that's why the Pro line of desktops
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.520]   is kind of lives in its own little sphere.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.400]   Because people coming in the mall
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.840]   who are excited about the iPhone anyway,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.720]   you can sell them anytime almost.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.160]   But I'm sorry, reverse that.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.200]   You can see they're coming in and they're
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.160]   going to buy in a predictable buying season.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.480]   The other people are sort of in different set of rules.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.240]   They're not really impulse buying a $3,000.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:38.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.640]   Two to the power of six processor.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.080]   New math.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.720]   I think you hit the nail on the head when you said,
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.120]   we've got to hit the Christmas buying season.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.480]   This is the Christmas buying season.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.080]   September is when you announce it maybe August even.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.640]   And it's going to be a consumer product.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.480]   It makes sense to be.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.000]   It should be the iPod.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.400]   And I think you don't have to tell anybody about the Pro.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.240]   It just happens.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.280]   Now the laptops maybe, especially the air,
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.400]   maybe the air is something you want
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.360]   to get the attention of the casual buyer who might still
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.680]   be seduced by this good looking device.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.920]   Yeah, I've used it to try to seduce women didn't work.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.040]   Want to see my super thin notebook?
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.600]   Yeah, I'm not surprised.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.720]   Somebody's done some interesting calculations
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:25.160]   based on the IME number on GSM units,
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.240]   including, especially particularly the iPhone.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.680]   And has actually used this to extrapolate the number
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.440]   of iPhones sold.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.040]   This comes from the unofficial Apple web log.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.760]   I'm going to tell you about it in just a second.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.280]   But before we do, time to Drobo wise.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.440]   Drobatize.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.920]   This is a Drobo with Firewire.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.000]   Have you had this yet, Scott?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.760]   You like the Firewire Drobo?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.960]   I'm lucky enough to have actually had one in beta.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.600]   I wasn't allowed to talk about it, but it was very fast.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.560]   Oh, man.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.080]   I'm using it to actually hold my main aperture library.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.600]   And then I'm using the USB version for my aperture vault.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.640]   So in a way, I actually have four copies of everything.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.920]   So that's the key on this.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.800]   It's safety because the Drobo is redundant.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.360]   Hot swapable.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.680]   If a hard drive goes bad, the special Drobo client on your Mac
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.360]   lets you know immediately.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.800]   And you just swap it in a new drive without even powering down.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.400]   And boom, you're back without a bit of data lost,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.560]   completely expandable up to 16 terabytes.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:36.360]   And now with this new Firewire, man, I love that.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.560]   We're talking a Firewire 800 for the ultimate speed, the USB 2.0,
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.400]   of course, on all units.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.560]   The original Drobo with USB is at a new lower price.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.800]   The second generation is out now with quieter, cooler operation
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:56.280]   two, and you get $25 off instantly by going to DROBO.com/Macbreak.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.960]   This really offered good through October 31, 2008.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.800]   This really is the backup drive you've been looking for.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.200]   I use my Drobo all the time.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.240]   In fact, I need to get a couple more.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.920]   That's the thing.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.600]   Drobo's are like potato chips.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.880]   You can't eat just one.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.520]   You always want more.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.400]   I have one that takes another USB one, which
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.120]   has the identical vault backup at home
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.560]   so that I have two-fismar.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.720]   Do you swap them, rotate them?
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.640]   Once a week.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.920]   Oh, that's very clever.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.800]   Yeah, once a week.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.960]   And I actually kept the little--
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.600]   I have a little box that's designed to hold the SATA drives.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.080]   And so I have four one terabyte drives.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.840]   I pull them out, stick them in that box
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.440]   so that they're safely transported the 10 minutes to my home.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.480]   And then I put them in the USB there and copy them.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.160]   It really works great.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.000]   And I have another Drobo tip this week if I'm allowed.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.240]   Please do.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:57.800]   Even though you can pull one out and have it heal itself, Leo.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.840]   The tip is, don't overdo that.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.480]   No, in fact, they recommend that you go into standby mode.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.840]   But you can, but you don't have--
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.280]   Yeah, go into standby mode and then do it.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.160]   Or disengage the drive through the disk utility.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.080]   I've never had one crash on me.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.000]   But you just--
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.800]   You have little faith.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.280]   The thing is, I pull them that way.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.080]   And in fact, doing-- I pulled some in front
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.160]   of some of the Drobo engineers when we were in the test
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.080]   process with these.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.280]   And they got a pain look on their face.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.360]   Well, you never know.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.760]   It's why I take a chance, right?
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.160]   But they said it will work.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.280]   And we've proven it.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.400]   Because Alex and I pulled one in the middle of a video copy.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.640]   The thing is, you just--
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.560]   that's designed to be a catastrophic failure.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.200]   So my tip is--
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.600]   That's only if you have to.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.480]   Don't overdo that demonstration for your friends.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.400]   It's like my eye doctor.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.480]   I bought some glasses, those twist flex glasses
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.000]   that you could twist around and stuff.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.480]   And he did it.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.240]   And he said, but I wouldn't recommend doing this all the time.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.160]   Don't do it for your friends.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.640]   This is exactly the line he said.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.000]   Go to Drobo.com/MacBreak $25 off.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.920]   If you don't have a Drobo, you're missing out.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.040]   These really are the greatest.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.960]   Drobo.com/MacBreak, we do thank them so much for their support
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.200]   of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   So--
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   Feeling droopy.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.640]   Feeling droopy.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.480]   I love it.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.800]   We need a jingle.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.160]   We have to have a jingle for that.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.000]   We should.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.120]   One of those AM radio, like eight part harmony.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.240]   I would love--
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   I would love to have jingles for all our sponsors.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   It'd be just some--
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   D-R-O-B-O.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.240]   D-L-N-D-R-B.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   Drobo.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   So much better.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   Remember the D-J's that they'd have the shout?
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   Scott, born.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.560]   All right, you're listening to DROBO radio right here on MacBreak
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.560]   Weekly.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.880]   Drobo.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   So the--
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:44.440]   This interesting kind of, I don't know, prognostication.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.120]   It's from AFB, an investor village.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:55.600]   They've been collecting iPhone IMEI numbers and adding them to a Google spreadsheet to
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:03.560]   try to figure out the relationship between the IMEI numbers and units made.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:11.840]   They calculate that Apple has now made at least 5,649,000 iPhone 3G's.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.480]   We know they've sold 2.4 million iPhone first generations to 2008.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.680]   They're at 8 million iPhones.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   What was the goal?
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.480]   They wanted to be at 10 million by the end of this year?
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.120]   Yeah, 10 million by Chris.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.120]   They may do it.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.840]   I think it's going to be close.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.280]   And it's a pretty stout goal.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.000]   It's actually a pretty bold goal when you look at a company making that claim that they're
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.680]   going to do that that had never been in the cell phone.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.680]   It was a very bold.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.760]   Now, as many have pointed out many times, Nokia sells, you know, what is it, a million
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.760]   a day?
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.760]   Lots more.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.880]   So it's-- but this is a smartphone.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.440]   So it's expensive.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.600]   It's got a much more narrow audience.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.160]   The real question is how are they doing against the BlackBerry?
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.040]   And I don't think we really can say anything about that until the BlackBerry bold comes
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.480]   out in about two weeks.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.040]   Well, BlackBerry leads.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.600]   I mean, there's no doubt.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.080]   It's just that here's a company that has the third largest share of smartphones in the
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.840]   world.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.080]   And it wasn't in the smartphone business two years ago.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.080]   I think that's--
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.280]   Pretty good.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.480]   They added Russia to companies, have struck a deal with Apple to sell in Russia.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.080]   I saw a rumor that they will finally sell the iPhone in China.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.440]   China is where most of the unlocked or cracked iPhones have ended up.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:34.800]   But like a quarter, some people are saying of the first generation iPhone.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.880]   So-- and Line Rider is coming to the iPhone.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.800]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.680]   That's the biggest story of the day.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.720]   Did you say LimeWire?
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.720]   Line Rider.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   Oh.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.360]   You know Line Rider?
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.360]   I know.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.360]   I thought you said LimeWire.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.400]   LimeWire would be cool if it came to the iPhone.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:57.120]   No Line Rider is one of the coolest flash games ever invented.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.480]   Where you draw the line on the-- it's like you're drawing on the paper and then the guy
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.160]   rides it and you have to get him around town.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   It's totally addictive.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.480]   You probably have stayed away from it just because you don't want to waste time on it.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   Guys, I've heard people saying it's up there with that desktop shooting.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   Just on the fence, yeah.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   We'll love it, yeah.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   That's the one I'm waiting for on the iPhone.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   Whew.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.480]   That'll be cool.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.400]   Now, Andy and Akko, have you played with Chrome yet?
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.320]   I have not.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   I have seen some demos.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:31.800]   As a matter of fact, there is a launch conference going on right now that I'm not listening to.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:38.120]   But I actually have a Windows machine to my left right now refreshing a couple of web
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.800]   pages to be ready to download it.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   I want to be one of the first 3 million people to download it.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.840]   I don't want to wait until later when there's a reasonable chance of my actually getting
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.280]   a copy of it.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:52.320]   If Google gets a little slow today, folks, is because they're releasing a browser, no
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.960]   Mac version, no Linux version yet.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   It's Windows.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.400]   It's called Google Chrome.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.640]   Well, you probably saw the cartoon.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.560]   So far, it sounds right in my alley.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.880]   Why is that?
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.200]   Well, I can't see it and it's for Windows.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   Wow.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.040]   Where do I sign up?
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   I can't wait to see it.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.600]   And it's got a cartoon.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.840]   It's not a cartoon, like a 38 page comic book written drawn by Scott McCloud, which is like
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.920]   saying, "Hey, Martin Scorsese, can you do a training video for our online show?"
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.080]   We're iPhone, we're Apple.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.240]   Scott McCloud is one of the heavy hitters in art.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.000]   He does one of those things that really raises eyebrows.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.440]   I think it's more like having Scorsese do something for a browser that only runs on
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.440]   Windows.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.360]   They're going to do a Mac version.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.200]   Now let's not be too mean.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.800]   Do you want to do a Mac version?
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.600]   Do you want to do an Linux version?
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.600]   All right.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.600]   It's Firefox.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.600]   It's tough.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.400]   It's really hard to get Firefox a day which you want.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.360]   Well, why is Google doing this?
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.760]   Why do we need another browser?
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:06.080]   Well, if you bother to read the comic book, Murrion, TLDR, TLDR.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:13.680]   Now, I realize that you have to regard this as a non-canon appearance of Captain America.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.040]   However, they're actually two different cases for this.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:22.120]   One is the case that Google Meg saying, "Hey, wow, this will be wonderful for you, the user."
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.920]   And they're doing...
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.400]   I myself...
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.720]   It's a project that's really close to my heart because I think maybe a year or two ago,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:34.360]   I actually wrote a column saying, "Why are we assuming that the concept of a web browser
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:40.280]   that was come up with a 1992 is still perfect and still relevant and does not bear a reinvention?
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.840]   This is their desire to reinvent the browser not only from a user interface level but also
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:50.200]   from an architecture level so that every web page gets its own little private sandbox.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.080]   The next time that a JavaScript thing goes, goes kablui, it won't take down your entire
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.080]   Firefox session.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.160]   It'll just take down that one tab.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.680]   Like all the protected memory, kind of?
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.880]   Oh, Andy, you can download it.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.880]   Go.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   Cool.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.120]   I already believe it or not, I already clicked it about three minutes ago.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.240]   So we'll see how well it goes.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.160]   And point by point, we can go through that.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   There's page after...
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.600]   Again, it's a comic book that does...
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.920]   I think it's the only effective way to try to get through all the tech reasons why this
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.200]   is supposed to be a better way of rendering pages and doing complex content.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.360]   But the real...
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.320]   To me, the more interesting thing is this is Microsoft in the early '80s figured out
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.360]   something brilliant, which is that you know what?
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.480]   We don't tell you what, go and make any computer you want.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.480]   We don't care.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.160]   We don't want to own the company that makes the computer.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.720]   We want to own the company that makes the software that you need in order to make that
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.720]   computer work.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.520]   And that's why they became Microsoft because they run an operating system that says, "You
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.520]   know what?
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.840]   We're not going to block out all these pirated ROMs or these third-party Phoenix ROMs that
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.040]   make IBM PC compatibles."
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.560]   Because from our point of view, the more machines can run our operating system and our software
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.720]   the better.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.320]   This is the same sort of brilliant move.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   Google doesn't...
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   Google doesn't now...
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:16.240]   No longer really needs to own an operating system or own a phone system or own a computer
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   system.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:24.520]   If they own the best browser for producing dynamic hosted applications, that instantly
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:30.480]   raises the profile of Google Docs, that instantly raises the profile of image editors, of finance
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.200]   applications.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.440]   Because now suddenly, people will...
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.560]   If people have started to write these wonderful web apps that are free, that are maintained
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:44.160]   at a remote server, that always work and are always upgraded for free, that will make it
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.720]   more important to use Google services, that will increase the value of the metrics, the
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.600]   data, the advertising data that Google is collecting and the value of the ads that they're
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.600]   producing.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.040]   I do believe that much of this decision on Google's part is reflected from their philosophy
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.720]   that we're a huge powerful company with lots and lots of smart people.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.840]   We can do stuff like this for free and it'll be awesome.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.520]   But I'm sure that just as much of that is, "You know what?
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.320]   This is a huge opportunity."
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:21.200]   If we make the premier browser for web-based applications, suddenly all web-based applications
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.040]   will be going through Google.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:33.960]   It's really about this idea of Google gears, of running it on your desktop as a web application
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:40.200]   on your desktop as a peer to a desktop application.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:46.000]   It really is a lot like every user who's using this is essentially tied into the same operating
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.240]   system in many ways to the same computer.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.480]   Now it doesn't mean that you're automatically connected to Google services.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:58.160]   You better believe it's going to work really awesome with Google Web Services.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.840]   The fact that they're creating this and supporting this and they're sort of saying, "You know
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.840]   what?
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.320]   We could make Google Docs so much better.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.400]   We could make this word processor, this spreadsheet, this presentation app.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:12.480]   We could make this into the app that everybody wants to use if only there were a web browser
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.760]   that had these features that were this secure, this trustworthy, this kind of--
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.480]   So is it more a reference platform that they want Firefox and Microsoft to adopt or is
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.000]   it really a tip to take market share from them?
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.600]   Well you know what?
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.440]   That's the interesting and the Mac related part.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.920]   It is based on WebKit.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.360]   Oh, so there's really shouldn't take long for them to make a Mac version.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   Exactly.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.040]   And WebKit is the fastest-- is absolutely the fastest browser, especially with JavaScript
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.040]   out there.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.040]   Exactly.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:47.640]   They're saying the reason why they chose WebKit was because the guys at the-- doing the
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.480]   Google phone project chose it and they talked to the guys at Google phone and said, "Well,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.360]   we chose because it was the least amount of hassle if you want to create a browser that
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   actually works."
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.400]   They are going to release open sourcing most parts of it so that people will be free to
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.720]   enhance it.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:08.520]   One of the highlights of it is a JavaScript interpreter called V8, which is supposedly
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:15.240]   a much, much better way of executing JavaScript than anything else that's out there.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.440]   For one, it means it does better garbage collection.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.040]   You'll have-- supposedly you'll have fewer of those problems where again, all you tried
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:28.880]   to do was try to watch some JavaScript movie terrelies and now suddenly the entire application
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.360]   crashes down.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.400]   Not only-- once again, not only is that JavaScript porn, is there JavaScript porn?
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.400]   I know.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.400]   Oh, I'm looking for-- you can hook a porn to anything.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.360]   In fact, no technology becomes successful without porn.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:50.600]   So WebKit is the open source framework that Safari is based on.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.440]   In fact, you can go to WebKit.org and get the latest build of WebKit that I believe includes
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.440]   that JA JavaScript interpreter.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.040]   So you do get that JavaScript speed.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:06.560]   And since all of this Google app stuff, all this Ajax stuff really relies heavily on JavaScript,
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.560]   that's important.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.360]   Speed in JavaScript is key.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.360]   But wait a minute.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.960]   Is what's sexy about this just that it's open source?
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.200]   Is that why everybody would be excited?
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.280]   Well, I think there are three main reasons why you might be excited about it.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.680]   Number one, that it will be a lot less crashy.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:33.200]   So websites that will tend to bring down a Firefox or Explorer or Safari, either A, it
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:38.040]   won't run into those problems because, again, it does a much better job of managing the
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.920]   memory that these little applets and these little JavaScripts take care of.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:47.960]   But also because if one tab of your 40 causes a problem, you can just bring down-- everything
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.120]   is run almost like its own process.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.160]   You can just close that one process and leave everything else going.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.280]   Number two, that they do have a lot of really cool user interface tweaks.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.440]   It's a lot easier to take one.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.760]   It seems a little bit gimmicky.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.320]   The tabs are actually on the-- hang off the outside of the window instead of the inside
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   of the window.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.840]   But that means that you can then make those tabs completely portable.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.720]   So if you want to turn Google Reader into essentially an application, you could drag
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.480]   it off of its tab and essentially it'll act as though it's its own little application
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   window.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   It's like fluid.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.960]   If you use fluid on the Macintosh, it's the same exact.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.960]   Okay.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   I've seen fluid.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.960]   All right.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.400]   And there are a bunch of conventional tweaks that you would expect that you don't think
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.800]   would be beyond the scope of Firefox or New Edition Safari.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.480]   There's one part of the demo that I actually liked.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.920]   Like a lot of people, I'm in the habit of-- I've set all my browsers so that when I create
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.520]   a new window, create an empty window because I don't want you to go slow trying to load
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.920]   in Apple.com or load in anything else because I'll tell you what I want.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.840]   They're saying, well, our philosophy is that why are we creating an empty window?
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.220]   You want information.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:54.120]   What if we were to try to guess at the information that you're about to want to access?
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.380]   So our quote, empty window, unquote, will open just as fast as an empty window, but
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.140]   it will also be a dashboard to things you've recently been looking at, things you recently
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.640]   been doing, things that are related, blah, blah, blah.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   The screenshot looks nice.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.240]   I've-- again, I haven't tried yet.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   But--
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.180]   Is there anything about this, though, that could not be accomplished?
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:15.320]   Setting aside business-- the obvious business reasons of wanting to compete with Microsoft
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.500]   about what you can and can't block.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.200]   Is there anything inside of this that either can't be accomplished through plugins with
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   Firefox or that by a tweak along the lines of a fork like--
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:31.160]   No, in fact, you can use Google Gears with Firefox right now, but it's more than that
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.880]   because Firefox uses that Gecko engine.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.360]   This uses a completely different engine, so that's significant.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.120]   It's like the difference between OS 9 and OS 10.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:44.280]   Yes, you could create an absolutely impeccably close OS 10 experience in OS 9, but you'd
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:49.780]   be building it on top of a lot of the mistakes that are the legacy of Mac OS 6.0.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:54.140]   Well, I'm going to be that guy, and I'm going to say, wow, you know, Firefox--
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.220]   I'll give you a chance to put in your Bluetooth headset.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.220]   Go ahead.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.220]   I personally--
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:03.060]   I used Safari, but I'm always very tempted by Firefox, especially when I see stuff come
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.420]   along like--
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.420]   Evicuate.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.620]   Evicuate, which you did a great piece on, and I immediately downloaded it, and it's
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.340]   fantastic in Firefox.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.560]   But I mean, even though I do use both browsers, but the part that I'm struggling in my head
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:20.460]   around is how this benefits the people who have come to understand the really good parts
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.560]   of what open source can do.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.100]   Not the annoying shut your mouth.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.120]   I've heard enough from you parts about open source.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:30.560]   As I like to put it, the lecture you're required to hear while you eat the Christian's free
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.560]   lunch.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:37.480]   But I am, I have to say, I'm very persuaded by the success story of Firefox in terms of
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.680]   making something that very much reflects what a lot of people want, and then the part that
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.520]   doesn't do what they want, you can do with a lot of really amazing add-ons.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.600]   And so the part that I'm just-- I hear what you're saying about the OS 10 versus 9, that
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.800]   sounds like a really good analogy.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.680]   I'm just trying to understand from a strictly from a user standpoint, how is this not exactly
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.320]   what we were afraid Google was going to do all along?
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.240]   How is this not their version of Explorer that's going to be one in heart to develop around?
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.680]   You say working is a bad idea.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.280]   Is that why you don't like it?
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.280]   What is the objective?
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.160]   I guess I'm at a point-- I'm at a point where we're about two things.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.400]   I'm a point where, first of all, like, well, help me understand why I as a consumer appreciate
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.000]   the wheel being reinvented.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.320]   And second, like increasingly, I just-- I'm looking for evidence to the contrary that Google
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.280]   is turning into its own slightly nicer and cleaner version of Microsoft.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.680]   Like, they're going to make a proprietary browser, right?
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.240]   First of all, they're not reinventing the wheel.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   They're inventing the rocket engine.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.200]   And the rocket engine does things that the wheel is not really capable of doing because
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.680]   the wheel was invented about, what, 20,000 years ago, whereas this is being invented
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.120]   like right now.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:45.960]   Secondly, I suppose there's the possibility that this is a desire for Google to become
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.960]   even more powerful.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.200]   But I don't care if it gives me a better browser.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.840]   I mean, if you want to use a text-based browser, you know, and be proud that, hey, man, this
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.000]   is open source, information wants to be free.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   That's a straw man.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   That's a straw man, you know.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   It is.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   It is.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Well, I appreciate it.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.880]   What's the advantage of using an inferior technology that does not give you the solutions
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.880]   that you want?
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.880]   Just because you say-
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.400]   Well, see, the advantage of putting a lot of faith into something we haven't seen yet
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.760]   based on a comic when there's a really outstanding open source version that I can control however
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.920]   I want already.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   Is this not open source?
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   It is open source.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.480]   We're telling- we're not telling everybody, drop what you're doing right now by a Windows
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.240]   machine and start running Google Chrome, chiefly because this is a very squishy public beta
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   right now.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:30.480]   This is the very first release that they're doing chiefly to get comments and to get feedback.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   When Google themselves says that this is not going to be ready for prime time for quite
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.640]   a while yet, that they've been working on this for quite a while, they obviously have
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.040]   a lot of experience in throwing web pages at things.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.880]   So they've already been testing it against a large database of popular sites and unpopular
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.280]   sites.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.440]   So we're not telling everybody, you know, sell your Macs because this thing is only available
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.560]   for Windows right now.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.160]   We're saying that this is really, really interesting.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:57.760]   If the only thing it does is says, let us create a brand new architecture for browsers.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:03.040]   It's not based on the needs of HTML 1.0 and a plug-in infrastructure that came a couple
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.120]   years later.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.840]   Let's create a brand new architecture for a web browser that's centered around the way
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.680]   that the web is run today.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.520]   That's a huge win for users.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.000]   And you know, if it makes Google more powerful, well, great.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   That gives us a far deep-
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.680]   Okay, but if it's said Microsoft Internet Explorer Turbo on the side of the rocket, would you
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.880]   have the same opinion based on a comic?
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.880]   Absolutely.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:23.880]   If they were promising this-
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.880]   I would.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:31.080]   I'm saying that if they were promising the same things that were- I'm sure it sounds
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:34.040]   a lot harsher than it actually is, but you know, it's not based on a comic.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.760]   It's based on a 40-page attempt, a really expensively produced and well-thought-out
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   comic.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.920]   It's not a marketing thing.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.080]   We want to make the case of why this browser is a good idea.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.000]   I'm going to have to read the comic.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.560]   I will say the difference, Merlin, is it is open source, which Microsoft would never do.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:57.760]   Microsoft's now released or made a two of Internet Explorer 8 and has turned off compatibility
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.760]   mode.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.200]   And so Microsoft is really thumbing its nose at compatibility.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.360]   I think it's not so bad to have a big player come in and say, "We're going to forward
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.080]   the idea of compatibility under the flag of open source."
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.640]   So it's really- I throw out Microsoft, "How about Firefox?
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.120]   Are you thinking that Google maybe should have put more effort into the Firefox project?"
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.520]   I don't have an opinion one way or another.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.520]   I just-
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.520]   I mean, there's plenty of browsers.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.160]   So here's the thing.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.800]   They're a public company and whatever they do is going to benefit the public company.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   And I think-
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.080]   Why did Apple do Safari?
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.840]   I mean, the Safari didn't need to be done.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.160]   Because it really helped integrate the entire experience for Mac OS X users.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.160]   But I'm-
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.160]   It would create Apple, Apple, Apple company.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.720]   Andy, if you could find enough straw, you could make a whole straw man store.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.720]   Listen to what I'm saying.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.600]   The thing is not out yet.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.240]   Just saying it's a straw man argument doesn't make it a straw man argument.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.280]   That's a really clever way to, you know, parry off what you're saying.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.320]   You're really- you're really- you're reducing what it is that I'm saying by talking about
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.440]   the part that I'm not saying.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.760]   And the part that I'm trying to say is, "We haven't seen this yet.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.880]   If it's open source, that's great.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.720]   If it works, it's great, great, great, great, great.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:09.080]   All I'm trying to say is that just because it's this big company that puts it out, I
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.080]   don't know.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.080]   I guess I feel like I want to learn more about this.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   Okay.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.080]   And-
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.080]   That's reasonable.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.080]   I'm saying-
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.080]   What you're describing isn't really a web browser.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.280]   You're describing a different kind of application for using the Internet, which is I think what
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.800]   Flock want it to be, which is fine.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.760]   But I mean, I guess I'm just- I'm happy to be the guy who's wrong about being skeptical
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.040]   about a big company that wants to change my web browser.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   And I'll stand behind that.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.320]   Well, look, I mean, I think it was pretty clear that when we're talking about a web browser
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.400]   that even I don't have a copy yet, that I'm not saying, "Well, this is a- this is the
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.400]   future of computing.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   This will trowels everything else and you're all fools for continuing to use whatever you're
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.400]   using right now."
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:49.120]   I mean, I don't really think that I need to verbally execute a terms of service, you
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.600]   know, on the terms upon which I'm speaking about this and the expectations that I have
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.720]   of it, I'm saying this is awesome news.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:59.280]   This is an awesome development, chiefly because if it makes the Explorer team and Safari team
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.240]   and Firefox team, say, "You know what?
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.560]   Let's move and let's push a little more.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.680]   Let's try to rethink old things that we just assume are the way that browsers ought to
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.800]   work because Google now wants to really build a brand new browser and they want to do it
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.720]   and they're clearly very, very ambitious about that.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.320]   That's a good thing.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:20.520]   And again, the, you know, I don't have a copy of it yet.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.680]   It's downloading as I speak.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.680]   It's on Google.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.720]   Because I haven't been able to get it started.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.800]   I think we should start a new show called This Week in Browser Wars.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   Google.com/chrome.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.280]   Here's what I would say.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:37.040]   I think as long as Google keeps it open source, Google can make a very strong case for the
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:41.440]   current browsers not being ideal for web-based applications.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.760]   And here's Merlin where Google's, you know, interest is, we're moving, we want to move
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.200]   people towards applications in the cloud, particularly Google Docs, but we don't feel
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:54.280]   the current crop of browsers does our applications justice.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.880]   Don't you think it's appropriate for them to write a, maybe it's not even intended to
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.440]   be the platform, but write a reference platform that does a better job.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.000]   As yet, there's no indication that Google is creating this as a platform that only runs
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Google Apps.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.360]   They're creating this to be a standards compliant browser that will run all web-based apps
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.080]   and all HTML compliant apps as best as they can possibly be run inside a browser.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.480]   Don't you think any that the real goal for Google is to make, not necessarily just Google
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.080]   Apps, but apps in the cloud run better?
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.680]   Or is the goal to put more ads on my desktop?
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:33.080]   They'll definitely benefit by increase credibility and increased credibility for Google Docs.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:37.040]   There are a lot of people who will not run Google Docs because it's a very, very good
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:41.120]   word processor and a very, very good spreadsheet, but it's still a web-based application.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:48.640]   There are limits to how rich a user experience they can create when they're creating a service
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.760]   that has to be dumbed down to the dumbest browser possible.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.920]   We could say Microsoft has not done a good job with standards.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.560]   Firefox has.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:03.360]   Firefox Gecko Engine is a very good engine, but it's not as fast as WebKit.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.080]   I think it's reasonable for Google to say, "Look, we want a cloud-based application.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.640]   We want web computing to work better."
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.920]   I think it's reasonable for Microsoft too as well.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   Their live mesh is critical to their future.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.960]   I think it would be reasonable for them to do it strictly to make more money because
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.720]   that's what businesses are all about.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.960]   Well, yeah.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.280]   Nobody knows how they plan to make money on the Google Apps.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.680]   I'm going to guess you hit it on the head, actually, Leo.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   Just for ads.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.960]   Well, Firefox, Mozilla Foundation makes a lot of money on Firefox just by virtue of having
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.920]   a Google search bar in the upper right there.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.760]   Flock has made the same kind of deal with Yahoo.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.000]   There's a lot of money to be made there.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.840]   I don't know why Google would necessarily want to disenfranchise those guys and do it themselves.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.040]   Maybe it is because they're paying too much to fall.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:46.960]   Yeah, they're looking at it.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:53.840]   It's the same thing that there's a certain company that licensed me some audio technology
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.800]   for streaming back in the day and saw us go in public and making money with it.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.280]   Then the next thing I knew, they were competing with it.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.320]   If you're paying somebody or letting somebody else make the money, it doesn't make sense
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:09.600]   as a business that's representing the interest to shareholders to say, "Well, I guess we
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.360]   don't want any of that money."
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:15.000]   It's reasonable to say that that would be a fine reason to do it, but I'm personally
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.360]   not interested, of course, until it comes to the Mac, since I don't own any Windows
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.360]   Michigan.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.360]   Right.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.880]   But I think that's got to be imminent based on WebKit.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.840]   I guess we can't speak to Google's intent.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.920]   It sounds like we have differing opinions of Google's intent.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.840]   Scott, you think it's to make...
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.080]   I don't know what their intent is.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.080]   I'm just saying I don't care.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.880]   It's a reasonable speculation that it's about ads.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:38.560]   If they make a new product and it serves their customers and it makes them some money, this
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.280]   is America, it's a capitalistic society.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.880]   I don't think that's evil.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.880]   I think people are free.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.720]   There's plenty of browsers to choose from.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:49.480]   Is it your chief objection, Merlin, that it gives Google too much power?
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.280]   I don't really have an objection.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.280]   Oh.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:58.280]   If you listen to the words that came out of my mouth, what I said was, "I haven't seen
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   this yet.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.280]   It doesn't run on a Mac.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.880]   We're talking about it on the Mac show, and I already have two browsers that I like."
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:03.880]   Right.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.680]   I'll tell you why we're talking about it on the Mac show.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:10.760]   I'm very much not in the business of guessing about stuff based on a spec and a comic.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   That's just...
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   That's what we do on Mac break weekly.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   Oh.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   Okay.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   In that case, I like it.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.920]   At first, I wasn't into it because I thought it was just going to be a way to get more page
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:25.400]   views on their site, but then I saw that it was faster on my Windows machine, and now
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.400]   I'm into it.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.400]   That was right.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   I apologize.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.400]   I got it all wrong.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   Got it backwards.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.800]   Do you ever use Firefox at all?
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.040]   Yeah, I use it all the time.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.000]   I use it as my second browser where it's stuck.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.720]   Why do you have a second browser?
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.920]   Because I'm awesome.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:46.160]   What I do is I love Safari for all kinds of reasons, including that it's just simple
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   and easy to use.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.640]   It just makes sense to the way that my mind works.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.440]   I think it maps as skeptical I was about Safari when it first came out.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.320]   When I used it, I found that it really works with the way my brain works.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:01.640]   There's stuff that's on Firefox that's just fantastically powerful.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:07.720]   And a combination of a few plugins in Greece Monkey changes the web substantially with
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   Firefox.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:15.280]   I think that's come out of the openness of this project and the fact that quality really
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.760]   floated.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:21.120]   I think when it didn't float, people complained about it and hopefully tried to make it better
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.360]   by getting their hands dirty.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.680]   I think that that's a terrific pattern to encourage.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:29.120]   The reason I don't use it all the time, it's not pretty enough yet, even.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.480]   It still doesn't feel Macky enough.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.560]   It's just something about it that feels a little bit like a play about web browser sometimes
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.480]   rather than an actual web browser.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.040]   But I got to tell you, I think Greece Monkey for me is going to be the future of being
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.760]   able to tolerate almost anything on the web.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.600]   The ability to go in and do things like shut off seeing someone on Twitter who's driving
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   you nuts.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:51.400]   In my case, I want to Greece Monkey Script, which is hide anything where any word about
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.280]   the election appears inside of a div.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:58.360]   Stuff like that can substantially change the way you experience the entire web.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.840]   I think that's wonderful.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.720]   What if, now see, this is the case Google makes for itself.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.680]   What if you could design a browser by testing it on almost every page out there?
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:13.000]   Google is using something called the Chrome bot to literally test its browser on rendering
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.840]   web pages as it indexes them.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   But that's like trying to--
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   Is that a big advantage?
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.560]   Well, I mean, it's like setting a bench line for health by hanging out in a TV ward.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:25.160]   There's so many pages out there right now that are broken on by design to work with
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.360]   Explorer.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.920]   Every day I get bug reports about non-existent bugs on my site because Explorer is such a
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.120]   piece of crap.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:35.600]   I just see what happens-- and again, this is my straw man, but I'm a straw man in a cautionary
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:41.360]   tale-- is what happens when one company gets to decide what goes inside the standard and
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.360]   doesn't.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.360]   Well, that's-- and you're right.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.640]   And no company should get to do that.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:48.400]   And I certainly hope Google wouldn't do that or cast its weight by--
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.440]   But it's only the standard if everybody likes it.
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.440]   I mean, we got--
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.440]   No, it's the standard because the standard's born agreed to.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.440]   There is a standard.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   I see what you were saying.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.440]   I misunderstood what you were saying.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.440]   There's a word--
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.080]   No, a standard is a way of saying when you're in America, you stay on this side of the yellow
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.080]   line.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:06.440]   And Microsoft says, well, moreover, we're going to add six more lines and sometimes change
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.440]   it.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.000]   No, I agree with you.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.440]   And I think everybody agrees that Internet Explorer, particularly on the Mac, is--
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:16.120]   Well, I mean, at a good point today-- and the way that this really has something to do
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:22.560]   with Macs is somebody should write me a grease monkey script that will hide the tweets that
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:27.680]   match certain words by Regex and anything like that, I would be very grateful for.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.800]   So that's how this is really about Macs.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:38.200]   I want to get you on our project to open up Twitter and to make track-- bring back track.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   We have a Twitter army.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.760]   We have our own Twitter clone.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:44.840]   And it's not because I want to become another Twitter, but because I want to really promote
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:49.920]   the idea of opening up the Twitter silo to track again.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.320]   Remember how useful track was?
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.640]   You'd say, you don't have to read the whole Twitter feed.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:57.440]   You just read the feeds of stuff that you're interested in.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.800]   And Twitter has closed that off, I think, because they plan to monetize it.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:05.840]   So I've got behind this open source project called Laconica.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.680]   We've got a Laconica instance running.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.440]   But even more than that, we're going to do a-- Steve Gilmore and Dave Weiner have started
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.880]   done something called a Bear hug camp, which is coming up sometime in September, to talk
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:20.040]   with all the parties and get them to open-- especially to get Twitter, but everybody to
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.520]   have an open standard.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.520]   There is a standard.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.280]   It's the standard that most everybody else uses.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.760]   It's based on Jabber called XMPP.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:32.480]   And if you allow third party sites to see your XMPP string, then all those things that
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:37.360]   you want, Merlin, can happen where you just say, I don't want to see this direct.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.160]   I only want to filter this and find exactly what I want.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:44.560]   Now, this, I have to say in my own way, because I am liberal arts major and I don't
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.080]   really understand what words mean, I think this is what I would call ironic.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:51.480]   It's ironic to me that you guys are okay with a company coming up with a web browser that
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:55.160]   takes the open web and makes you experience it in a certain quote unquote improved way.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.560]   But then you got a company who comes up with some IP that's genuinely original and builds
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.920]   a community about it, and then you want them to open it.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   Like to me, like--
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.920]   Ah, but here's the deal--
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.120]   If you aren't every one of those users--
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.320]   I'm not sure I understand either half of that.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.320]   I'm not surprised.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.320]   That's my--
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.400]   Here's the deal, Merlin.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:14.880]   And I know your friends with Evan, but here's the deal is that we as a community have created
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.720]   a lot of value inside Twitter.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.520]   Twitter then says, "Okay, by the way, we're going to turn off I am.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.720]   We're going to turn off track.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:25.200]   We're going to buy some eyes and internalize it, and we're going to absolutely monetize
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.160]   the intellectual property that you've put into Twitter."
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.160]   And I think that's breaking their contract with the people who originally joined Twitter
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.520]   to share their stuff publicly.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.680]   Yeah, friend or no, I don't have an opinion about that.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.280]   But I think it's something that's their company and it's their stuff.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:45.600]   Also, there's a Perl script you can run that will download all your tweets for you.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.960]   So if you did want to make that portable, personally, I think it would be really cool
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:52.560]   of them to say, "Hey, here's one button to click for an XML or a CSV or whatever of
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:53.560]   all your toots.
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.040]   To me, that would be really super cool."
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.000]   Well, even better the next thing is-- and that's what XMPP is-- an XML of everybody's
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   toots.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Right.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   And to me, that's what's really cool.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.400]   We really want to call them toots because they're great.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.400]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.400]   I like it.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.400]   I'm going for toots.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.400]   It was toots.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.400]   That was Adam's idea.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.400]   I'm just socializing it.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.400]   Toots--
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.200]   Tootes brings about a certain bean kind of thing.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.200]   I know.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   It's vaguely intestinal.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.200]   I like that.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.360]   I think that's inappropriate for Twitter posts.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.360]   Why?
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.120]   I'm just joking.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:27.400]   I think it's wonderful because a lot of Twitter stuff goes actually beyond toots to something
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.400]   else.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.400]   So anyway--
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.920]   Anyway, watch what we're doing.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:37.120]   If you want to take a look at army.twit.tv, but the idea is one of many instances-- Merlin,
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.720]   you could have a 43 folders one.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.520]   Scott, you could have a TwiP photo one.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.520]   There could be a celestial--
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.520]   I don't know what to do.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.520]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:47.720]   Here the conceptually, the idea would be that these would be federated.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:52.840]   You could follow somebody on any of them and see those in your timeline.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:53.840]   They could follow you.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.920]   You could have conversations across these.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:03.400]   And more importantly, it opens up the stream of all the content for third parties to use
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.800]   in all sorts of creative and interesting ways.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.720]   This is stuff that Twitter's turned off.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.680]   And we're trying to put-- the whole idea of a bear hug is to try to encourage them to
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.800]   open it up again so that people can use it.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.320]   But that's neither here nor there.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.080]   Bear hug camp, if you want to see more bear hug camp.com.
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.360]   It's time for our Mac picks.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.200]   And before we go to our Mac picks, let's get our audible picks in here.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.800]   Andy and I go, have you been doing any reading lately?
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.640]   I'm still working on the book that I started a couple of weeks ago, but I was excited to
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:35.280]   find out that Michael Palin has a new travel series.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.880]   He's going to be a great vice president, by the way.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.600]   And I just want to thank--
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.720]   Mr. McCain for making a modern Python figure.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.120]   And you guys have wrong there, Leo.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.880]   They can get that wrong.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.520]   He's not going to be the Republican vice president.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.160]   That's Sarah Palin.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.880]   Oh, his sister?
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.880]   It must be.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:59.280]   It's spelled Palin, but it's pronounced Raymond Luxury Yacht.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.080]   So Michael Palin is on Audible?
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.120]   Yes, well, he has a couple of different books.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:09.880]   But one of the great things he's been doing post Python has been ever since 1980 when
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.680]   the BBC sent him around the world in 80 days.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.040]   He's been doing this every three years.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:18.840]   He does another travel adventure series where he picks a topic and sets off on a really
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.600]   incredible journey, maintains a daily diary.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.600]   It becomes a book.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.800]   It becomes a book of photos.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   It becomes a series.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.800]   Wonderful stuff.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:33.760]   The latest one is about the new Europe, ever since the Europe aside that what if we
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.120]   had one money, what if we all were the same type of hat and what if we had the same sort
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:42.880]   of legislation that decided how big a sausage needed to be before you call the sausage.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.480]   They decided to make this really broad tour of what Europe had turned into in the 21st
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.960]   century.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.600]   And it's written from his own perspective and his own point of view.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.120]   He has just weeks and weeks and weeks worth of adventure.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.520]   This new Europe is the abridged edition apparently of the companion book.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.200]   So it's only seven hours long.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.240]   But it is read by the man himself.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:13.800]   So it is like sort of a sort of a if imagine a member of Monty Python who is now 60 years
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.640]   old instead of 28 and imagine the sort of stuff that he would write about and it will
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.640]   not disappoint.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.640]   Oh, I can't wait.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.560]   New Europe, Michael Palin narrating and writing.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:28.840]   You could be your free book by going to audible.com/macbreak50,000 books.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.480]   By the way, a lot of money Python on there, including individual bits.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.600]   It's a really great resource for audio content.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.360]   I mean, not just books, you know, the speeches from the convention are on there for free.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.720]   Barack Obama's acceptance speech.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.440]   In fact, his speech in 2004 is on there for free as a pro bono thing.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.280]   I'm sure they'll do the same for the Republican National Convention.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.480]   It audible is a resource.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.600]   If you like to listen of all kinds of great stuff, check it out.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.520]   audible.com/macbreak.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.400]   We thank him so much for their support of Mac break weekly.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.840]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.880]   And I think I know what Merlin might be picking, but I'm not going to guess.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.840]   I'm going to let him say Merlin.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.840]   What did you think?
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.680]   I was thinking maybe ubiquity.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.480]   No, somebody else should do ubiquity, but it's a great, really interesting.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.480]   Great firefly plugin.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.440]   For an 0.1, that's pretty amazing.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:32.000]   You know, who did it is a raskin, Jeff Raskin's son, Raskin, of course, the guy who basically
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   invented the Mac.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.080]   He was forced out of the Mac team eventually because he wanted to be basically a very,
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.080]   very simple device.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.080]   Steve Jobs had other plans, but Jeff Raskin, one of the great guys on user interface and
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.360]   his son, is it Ezra?
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.600]   Is it, can't remember his son's name?
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   Yeah, I forget.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:54.120]   Anyway, he's been working on this with Firefox and fantastic.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.280]   It's basically a quick silver for Firefox.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.960]   Yeah, I think that's, I mean, this isn't my pick, but I agree.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.600]   It's a really interesting idea.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.600]   And yeah, the idea is to inside the, your browser window, inside the, you know, content
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:14.240]   pane, you hit a key and up pops a little, what did you call it, a heads up display kind
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.240]   of or a bezel, I guess a heads up display.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:21.000]   And you just start typing stuff and you can do stuff based on what you type when you hit
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Hunter.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.800]   He's a, he's a, he's a Raskin.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.240]   He's a, and anyway, it's a, there's tons out there about it this week, way too much,
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.240]   probably, but it's a really interesting idea, very much worth looking at and trying out.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   There is a, there's a Twitter command for it and there's a Twitter army command for
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.480]   it too, by the way.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:40.720]   So you just, you know, option space and type your, your tweet and there it goes.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.080]   One thing that's interesting is for folks who really are into this idea of WebOS and
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.840]   who live inside a browser, say on Linux or, or Windows and may not have a version of a
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.520]   quick silver like application that they're satisfied with, this is pretty powerful.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.640]   If you've never used quick silver before, it's not, it doesn't do what, it doesn't
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.760]   do the thing that distinguishes quick silver, which is creating functional sentences.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.720]   But to give you a flavor of what an application launcher like app can do for you, I think
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.840]   it's pretty dramatic to use.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.040]   It's fantastic.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.200]   But in fact, your pick is Chrome, right?
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200]   Yeah, no, it's terrific.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:16.480]   It's so funny about that when I heard the name, I had been pitching my friends at Omni Group,
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.160]   the idea that they should make a program called Omni Chrome.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.000]   And just because, you know, their apps are so good, but I was like, you know what?
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.360]   You should, you know what people would love?
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.480]   People would love an application that's nothing but configuration options.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:33.880]   And so you go in, it does nothing but spawn, you go in and it does nothing but spawn new
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:38.680]   kinds of Chrome for you to then modify, which then adds more Chrome for you to have preferences
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.920]   about and so on and so on.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.920]   Great idea.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   I love it.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.560]   I very, probably more often than I'd like to admit, I'm incredibly wrong about something
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.760]   or not wrong, but maybe just I was wrong at the time.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.080]   There's been a program around for a while called, I guess, Slife, S-L-I-F-E.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:00.960]   And it's a program for the Mac for OS 10 that when I saw it was an interesting idea that
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.400]   did nothing that I needed.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.320]   At the time that I saw it a few years ago, it's a program that basically said, "Hey, I'm
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.880]   watching the applications that you use and you spent this much time in a web browser."
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.360]   I remember that, yeah.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.480]   And everybody's like, "Mural, in this app really sounds like you should check this out."
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.360]   And I'm like, "Well, I'm going to ask you what I ask all my kids when they tell me there's
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.680]   a new productivity app.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.520]   What does this change about your behavior based upon using it or is this just a fun
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.960]   way for you to not do your work?"
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.360]   And at the time, that's how I felt because to me, like saying, you know, it's productive
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.960]   or not to spend an hour as a day in a browser is kind of like saying, you know, you're a
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.240]   good carpenter because of how many hours you use a hammer.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.800]   But this has changed substantially.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.640]   It's not perfect, but it's really cool.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.000]   When I first tried it, it didn't have a lot of the apps I used.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.240]   Is it a pretty good set of apps now?
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.640]   Well, I'm going to do you one better.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.640]   A, yeah.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.800]   You launch an app and use it.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.040]   So what happens is you go in and just start this thing running.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.440]   You don't even need to pay any attention to it.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.440]   But then you go and do your stuff.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440]   Right.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.440]   Browse the web.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.360]   You type, if you're me, you type in text mate, you're in that newswire, you're visiting
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.240]   Gmail, you're doing all this different stuff.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.000]   A, it captures the time.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   I want to put this in the correct techie way.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.640]   It captures the time that any given application was focal and you set a timeout time.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:15.600]   So if I open up omni focus and spend two minutes in it and then walk away, it'll record that
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.320]   I spent three minutes on the app because because after a minute, in my case, it says, okay,
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.720]   you're probably not doing anything here anymore.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.720]   And that's pretty cool.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.000]   It says this now for pretty much every application that you launch, including Slife.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.760]   So it's not just Coco apps anymore.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:29.760]   It watches whatever.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.760]   Okay.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.440]   So here's where you go to the 10th power.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.440]   It also watches any web page that you've been on and any document that you opened on
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.920]   your computer.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:46.080]   So I now have the ability to go in and create a set of activities, a set of applications,
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.240]   web pages and documents that define what I would call blogging.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:55.760]   If I'm in, if I'm in, if I'm on this page on my Drupal site, you know, or if I'm in this
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.680]   file that I use to write in and so on and so on, I can create these groups of time and
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:05.000]   say, listen, from now on, I don't want to spend more than one hour a day on email.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.400]   So whenever I'm in Mailbot app, whenever I'm on Gmail, et cetera, et cetera, record that
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.400]   time.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.720]   And then at the end of the day or at the end of the month, I can see if I was on or off
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.200]   my goal.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.960]   And it's a way of, I mean, at the very least, it makes you more mindful about where your
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.240]   attention goes, which I think is really valuable.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.360]   But then if you're, if you're a stats nerd, it's a way to, you don't have to watch this
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.360]   thing all the time.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.120]   You could go in every few days and it's mind blowing to realize in my case, how much
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.760]   time I was spending just looking at Twitter and not laughing at election jokes.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.240]   And I said, you know what, this is not making me happier.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.240]   It's making me sad.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.480]   And so I made a change.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.280]   And so I just think that like it's an app that's really come a long way.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.280]   I take back what I said about this not being useful, which it wasn't at the time.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.280]   I don't take it back.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.280]   I am ended.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.000]   I say that this is a really, really cool app.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.120]   I wish it was better at working across multiple Macs to be really effective and could show
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:58.000]   me patterns of like how I act differently, behave differently on the laptop versus the
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   tower.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:08.480]   But it's called life, S L I F E. And it's put out by life labs and it costs nothing money.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.640]   No, it's free.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.640]   It's not free.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.640]   It was free.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.640]   Did they start charging for it?
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.440]   Well, I think it costs.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.440]   I bought it.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440]   You did?
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.440]   Yeah, of course I did.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.800]   I paid for my software because it says it's free.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.960]   I don't pay for cable.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.360]   You actually get it.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.560]   I didn't used to pay for cable.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   I paid for satellite.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.640]   It says it's now completely free.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.800]   There you go.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.360]   I guess they're going to make it up on volume.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.320]   S life labs, S L I F E labs.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.720]   Here's the anti pattern.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.920]   And here's what I want to be super clear about like don't don't take around in this
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:40.920]   thing all day long.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.320]   Like open it and turn it on and then watch what happened.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.880]   But by all means do not spend all your time monitoring your meta work because that's
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.320]   just going to make you lose your mind.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.320]   But it's really interesting.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.240]   What I would say is turn it on hide it and let it run for three days and then come back
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.880]   and be ready to have your mind blown.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.160]   You really found out stuff that you didn't expect when you did that.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.520]   It's so funny and usability testing and user experience testing.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:08.160]   There's a very big quality and quantity difference between watching what people do versus asking
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.000]   them what they say they do.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   And for example, I can look here and look at my last month.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.920]   I only ran it for a few days.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:22.000]   But I see that the number one thing on here is Twitter.com/home which surprised me.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.320]   I mean if I sat around and said what's important in my life, what I say number one is Twitter
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.960]   and number two is Gmail.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:34.400]   I mean in my abstract world, well, you know, I'm confronted with evidence now that compels
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.720]   me to change my behavior based on what I claim to really care about.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.400]   You can also join a team with this which is kind of interesting.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.400]   That's what they say.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.720]   It's a thing I don't think I don't know if they do.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.400]   That's kind of more like Wacupa in that respect.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.080]   I don't know if they've either not implemented it or they just haven't gotten back to me
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.080]   but I did request that because I want to be my own team.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.720]   I want to be on your team.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.720]   Oh, you're always on my team.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.920]   Leo, you're always the head of my team.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   What team is that?
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.920]   Team awesome.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.920]   Team awesome.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.160]   Team, team, team, like, team incredible.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.760]   Mr. Andy and I co your pick my friend.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.520]   My pick is an oldie but a goodie and an upgradey of an oldie and a goodie.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.520]   E.B. edit bare bones.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.520]   Oh, you stole mine.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520]   I love it.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.520]   I love it.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520]   Yes.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.720]   It's one of my favorite apps ever.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.280]   It is a text editor.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.400]   It doesn't do boldface if you need a word processor that doesn't boldface.
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.560]   I'm afraid you can have to look elsewhere for that.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.720]   But it is the ultimate editor for plain text documents.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.520]   That is not to say that it is not a great text editor.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.520]   It's not a great word processor.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:42.560]   As a matter of fact, for the first nine years of my newspaper column, every single column
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.320]   was written in B.B. edit.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.920]   It only got replaced just this year by Scrivener.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:53.680]   And the reason why I was using it as my favorite text editor, word processor for this was because
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:59.480]   there are times when you need the most portable format of text anywhere.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480]   Plain text.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.480]   Just plain text.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.160]   And you want speed and you want stability and you want reliability.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.840]   And you want, I don't want to be distracted by talking paper clips.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:14.520]   I don't want a wizard to tell me that, oh, I can center you for that automatically.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520]   What is I?
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.760]   No, no, no, I don't want this center.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.760]   Just let me type.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760]   Just let me type.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.760]   Just let me type.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.160]   But it's really designed for people who bash out code for living.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.760]   And for those kind of people, you're going to find every single creature comfort for just
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.800]   about everything that's everything that you would, every language you would use in order
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.120]   to create the animated paper clips and the animated dragons, the animated wizards.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:39.560]   I was using it just the other day because again, I'm in the process of moving my site
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.720]   from one place to another.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.360]   And it involves a lot of just bashing these text files.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:49.120]   And the Esperanto of the web continues to be the humble text formatted file that as an
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:56.240]   XML file contains all the information in your blog or that as a MySQL export file contains
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.880]   everything you need in order to get this running or all the scripts in order to do all the magical
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.120]   stuff going.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.360]   And that's that's the sort of thing where you need heavy process, a specific type of
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.600]   editor in order to make your life good.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.160]   For instance, I needed to go through the XML database and make sure that all the references
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.200]   to one URL were changed to a different URL.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.600]   And I could have opened it in a standard word processor.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:22.600]   But because BB edit is designed specifically for this type of job, I could simply say,
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.520]   please show me all instances of this string of text.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.360]   It does do regular expressions, all kind of cool stuff.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.360]   This was kind of simple.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.560]   Show me all instances of this text in this document.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.840]   And it's not just highlight next, highlight next, highlight next.
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.240]   This the you get a results window that splits into two panes in which every single line
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.960]   of text in which it appears is excerpted.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.080]   And then I can simply navigate just like it's a it's a series of 500 emails, make all
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.160]   the change inspect each one of them make all the changes, burn them back into a new file
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.520]   and then keep going.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:58.800]   All the different files that went on to my old site that whereas we're being managed
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:05.480]   by my homemade Apple script web logging utility, I can simply have that entire site open in
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.040]   one window in which all the different HTML files, all the different menu systems, all
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.720]   the different CSS files are separate items inside there.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:17.000]   And it opens and saves its state when I go back to edit it the next day.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.520]   It's exactly where I left it.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:22.960]   It is also for people who are just developing their own websites, not even in a commercial
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:27.440]   sense, but just as a way of, you know, Gia, I want to make my site look better than something,
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.920]   you know, from geocities.com.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.160]   I find that it is the it is the easiest way to build style sheets is the easiest way to
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.440]   build JavaScript.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.760]   It's only 125 bucks, which is a lot of money if you compare to like a free text editor
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:46.240]   that comes with your Mac, but when you compare to the more hardcore website design systems
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:52.160]   that cost 300 400 500 bucks that on a certain level are just way too complicated for what
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.720]   you want to do, which consists of, you know, let's download this PHP script, see how it
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.200]   is edited or download this JavaScript, preview it in a live in a live window.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.400]   Oh, wow, that works.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.080]   Download this CSS template, tweak it to what you want to do.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.440]   And once again, use live updating to see G.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.640]   If I add the some letter spacing here into this style sheet, what happens to my layout?
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.680]   Well, BB ed, it will automatically update a preview window to show what it looks like.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.560]   It really is one of those Swiss Army knife tools at any time you're dealing with a file
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.080]   that has to be a text file.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.840]   It will give you exactly the tools you need to make quick work of whatever job you're
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.000]   faced with.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.080]   The new one has some really nice features.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.080]   I have to say I moved over to text mate some time ago.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:38.640]   I'm sorry, Rich Segal was a long time BB ed user, but I have to say the new BB ed at
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.720]   nine is it's moving me back is incredibly powerful.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.720]   And boy, I mean, just on and on with a functionality, go to barebones.com to learn more about
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.720]   it.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.720]   It's the best slogan in Mac software history software that doesn't suck.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.320]   Yeah, BB ed at nine.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.320]   It doesn't suck.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.720]   By the way, that's a registered trademark of barebone software.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:03.920]   I should mention that Rich Segal, the head CEO and I don't know what else he does.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.840]   I'm sure he has lawnmower, but he cuts the grass in front of the office is a good friend
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.120]   of mine, but realize that I've been using BB ed at way, way before we became good friends
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.240]   because I started complaining bitterly about some of barebones of software.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.800]   And then when he found out that he only lived about a half hour away from me, he decided,
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.440]   well, what if we just meet the meet at the back of the warehouse and have this out once
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.240]   and for all, you know, and there was three months of hospitalization, two years where
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.240]   the locksters were.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.240]   That's a big guy.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.640]   Yeah, Rich is great.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.920]   And he's been on the show, in fact.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.560]   And I have to say, no prejudice at all on this one.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.840]   I think BB ed at nine is really a home run, really nice job.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.840]   Absolutely.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.640]   I was going to be my pick, but I'll just I'll just say a second motion.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.640]   I threw a new bickwity.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:54.760]   I'll have I got to let us move on to last, but not least, Mr. Scott born.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.800]   I have a simple pick called Photomatics.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.400]   That's my pick from a simple man.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.560]   It's called Photomatics.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.640]   It's a plugin that helps with those cool little HDR and tone mapped images.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.240]   Everybody's starting to play with these days.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.560]   Oh, this is remarkable.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.560]   I've seen this at work.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.240]   It is incredible.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:20.840]   At hdrsoft.com, the price ranges between 69 and 119, depending on whether you get all
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.160]   the goodies or just some of them.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.400]   Now Photoshop has an HDR plugin.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.840]   Is this better than that?
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.640]   It is because that does not do what we call tone mapping, Leo.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.440]   It just it just basically does exposure blending.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.440]   Okay.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:36.800]   Yeah, I haven't been real happy with the HDR's I've gotten from Photoshop.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.720]   Well, that just because it's just doing exposure blending tone mapping really converts the
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.720]   highlight and shadow detail into a way that more closely matches the eye.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.040]   And this is really the story of this particular plugin.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.440]   I've tried them all.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.440]   I've used every single one on the market.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.640]   This one works the best in my opinion.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.680]   If you like taking HDR images, for those of you who don't know what that means, it means
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.200]   taking several exposures that are identical.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.040]   We just change the amount of light that gets in on each shot using your shutter speed,
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.280]   aperture control, et cetera.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.560]   You want to try to get a consistent depth of field so you probably want to avoid the
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.040]   aperture if you can using your shutter speeds the best way.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.440]   Then you bring those images into something like photo matic.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.640]   How many stops apart do you recommend?
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.240]   Well, I like, you know, this will work on one photograph.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.520]   Allegedly, I've never tried that.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:32.680]   I like to go a one stop apart and three images of one stop apart.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.680]   That's sort of a minimum.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.880]   I actually, you know, try to do five because the more it's like anything else, the more
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:40.360]   data you give it, the better the results.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.320]   Now it'll take a little longer, but it's worth it if you're trying to get it.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.880]   It also depends on how much latitude there is in the scene.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.960]   If you have a scene that has only got about three stops of latitude, then you're not going
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.960]   to worry about it.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.600]   If you got 11 stops of latitude, I'd start at the low end, go to the high end.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.720]   And you know, it's okay to go two stops between if you're going to take them by.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.960]   So, so expose, say, for the brightest part, usually the sky, and then just one stop at
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:11.360]   a time, just take exactly the same photo at darker and darker f stops.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.560]   Yeah, using your shutter speed is the best way to do that.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.800]   Changing the shutter speed if you can.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.800]   Oh, not aperture.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.800]   You do shutter speed.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.760]   No, because you're changing your depth of field if you change.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.760]   Oh, I see what you were saying.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   Yes, of course.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.800]   And a tripod would certainly be a big help here.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:31.480]   It's possible to do without a tripod, not for 11 shots, in my opinion, but certainly
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.000]   possible to do without a tripod.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.560]   Although I prefer to use a tripod and be very careful about moving the camera.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.600]   Most of these plugins, including this one, will do some alignment for you.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.920]   Yeah, because you're going to move it if you change your shutter speed.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.560]   It's going to jiggle it a little bit.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.960]   Well, you can do if you have a good tripod, it won't.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.560]   I mean, you can adjust the shutter speed with a remote, for instance, that has that kind
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.200]   of control.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.480]   Or you can just wait until the camera settles down after you change the shutter speed.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.960]   This doesn't work, obviously, for fast-moving scenes where there's moving subjects.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.240]   But if you're just doing a static shot of the Eiffel Tower, for instance, which is the
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.640]   example on their homepage, that's going to be okay.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:11.400]   And these programs, all of them, including this one, will do some image alignment for
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:14.120]   you in case you do move around a little bit.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.520]   But that really slows down the processing.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:21.160]   But if you want to try HDR photographs, this is in my opinion the best way to do it.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:25.400]   It's not terribly expensive at most, about a seventh of an Alex.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.520]   And all of us on Twitch use it.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.880]   And I really think it's quite good.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.880]   I'm just looking at this.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.600]   I so underscore this.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.080]   This is one of the best applications.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:40.840]   If you ever wonder why a picture that you took in your mind standing there in the street
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.520]   corner and you thought, my God, this is going to be the most beautiful shot ever.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:46.840]   I'm definitely going to blow this up and mount this on my wall.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:50.960]   And then you get into Photoshop or you get into Aperture and you really, man, actually,
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.560]   it was so much more vivid than this.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.000]   There's so many more details in that shadow.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.320]   If you had been there with a tripod and had a copy of this program at home and just sent
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:04.080]   a shot of bracketed series of photos, it will build that absolutely gorgeous picture and
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.360]   doesn't have to be complicated at all.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.440]   If you have any sort of a digital SLR or even a digital pocket camera.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.640]   Some of these are pocket cameras in their gallery.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.640]   Exactly.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.000]   I mean, they have the most pocket cameras even just have a bracketing mode built in.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.480]   So you don't don't necessarily mess with it.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.200]   The more you know, the better you can get the results.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.880]   But all you got to do is just say just underexposed by two, underexposed by one, perfect exposure,
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.520]   overexposed by one, overexposed by two, good, you're done.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.680]   And then worry about when you get home.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.160]   Collect as much information as you can do when you're there at the site and then worry
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.160]   about it later.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.480]   I'm looking at the user gallery, just gorgeous stuff.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.480]   Wow.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:41.600]   If you go to my Flickr feed, Flickr.com/photos/andii, if you do a search for HDR, you'll see a bunch
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.640]   of pictures taken via HDR.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.840]   As a matter of fact, there is one of my favorite pictures as a picture of the Miss Worcester
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.720]   Diner in Worcester, Massachusetts.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:56.440]   I took a series, then first did an HDR via Photoshop and then you did it using Photomatics
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.680]   and got much better results via Photomatics.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.960]   I love this program.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.040]   Very nice, very nice stuff.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.520]   All right, guys.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.800]   Hey, a great show, great stuff.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:10.440]   And I don't think anybody died, although there was blood spilled.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.000]   You thank Google for that.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.040]   I'm off to download Chrome anyway.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.800]   Merlin Man is at ulooknicetoday.com.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:24.360]   And by the way, I understand a new edition out and you might want to run, not walk and
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.320]   get the copy of that because it is the funniest show.
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.400]   Oh, Miss Worcester is making me hungry now.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.760]   It is the funniest show on the internet.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:37.400]   I must have you look nice today.com.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.400]   Thank you, Merlin.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.400]   Yes, sir.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.920]   Good to talk to you as always.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.880]   We're glad to have you back.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:49.880]   Scott Warren, as you can tell, the photo pro at TwipPhoto TWIP.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:54.320]   Scott's flying up to Alaska this afternoon to take pictures of brown bears.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.320]   Grizzly bears.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.320]   What kind of bears?
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.320]   Polar bears?
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.280]   The official subspecies name is Coastal Brown Bears.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.200]   They're the largest grizzly bears in the world.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.280]   Actually, they're the largest bears in the world, 1500 pounders.
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:10.080]   We're going to Geographic Harbor, which is about as remote a place as you can get.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.440]   We're not going to be doing the pictures on the bear stand.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.200]   Everybody else does a cat, my national park.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:18.440]   There'll be nothing but air and opportunity between us and these bears and we'll be on
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.720]   our own.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.800]   And I'm looking forward to it.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.800]   I also want to mention Leo, a couple more days in our aperture nature workshops contest
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.400]   before this first one closes.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.600]   We'll do another one, but had more than 2,000, 3,000 photos already dropped.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.000]   It didn't hurt that we're the number one item on the Apple homepage today.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.720]   But anyway, I want to mention that that's still going on too.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.720]   Thank you.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.720]   That's great.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   Yeah, TwipPhoto.com.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.480]   Already he's got his video diary up for his Alaska adventure.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.200]   And I guess it'll be on Discovery at some point, yeah.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.440]   Well, yeah.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.560]   There's never any guarantees.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:52.600]   They film me three times doing stuff one time they actually put me on the show the other
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.760]   two times we didn't.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.760]   But it doesn't matter.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:00.240]   I get to go take pictures of giant grizzly bears in places that most humans will never
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.240]   see.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.240]   So I don't care.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.240]   Yeah, that'll be fun.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:07.200]   I'm going along with my friend, Artie Morris, who is the world's number one bird photographer
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.200]   one of my mentors.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.040]   So I don't have to actually teach this time.
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.440]   I'm just like a shooter.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.360]   I see you do this video with your G9.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.360]   Should I wait?
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.840]   Because I've heard there's a new G9 coming out.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.040]   Actually, the G10 will be announced.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.120]   I'm speaking a little out of school here.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:24.280]   I'm going to guess any day or photo keen at the latest.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.600]   So I should probably not buy a G9 at this point, but wait.
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.760]   It's going to probably be hard to buy one.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.760]   Yeah, it's there.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.400]   They're dropped out of inventory, although the G9 is a fine camera.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.640]   And if you just wanted to get to use when you'd be happy, I think the video is really
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.640]   good.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640]   This is looking right.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:44.920]   I have to say that now my Nikon D90, which is on order, may take its place for video.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.080]   It's going to do video.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.600]   The new D90 24 frames per second video.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:54.280]   And with all the lenses I have, that'll be some cinematic effects.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.240]   Oh, I'm really pissed now.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.960]   Did you buy something yesterday that made this?
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:02.840]   No, I'm just saying I when you went to Nikon, I stayed with Canon.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.600]   I keep saying Canon's going to catch up.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.400]   Now Nikon takes another leap ahead.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400]   Dang.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.400]   Hey, but they did.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.400]   They did announce the D50.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.880]   I mean, the 50 D whatever.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.080]   Yeah, but I want a I want a 5D mark too.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.080]   That's what I want.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.640]   And that'll be that'll be it also a photo.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.640]   And I want and I want video.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.400]   Well, I saw there is going to be video, I think.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.640]   I don't know whether it's going to compare with the D90.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.000]   See if you listen to a trip, if I listen to a trip more often, I know all this stuff.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   You would.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   To a photo.com.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   We need to have you on the show again.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   I'd love to.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   I'd love to.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.840]   Andy Naco is at the celestial waste of bandwidth moving through the clouds right now.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:43.960]   But if you still go to cwob.com, the standard front door to the site, you will see a cleverly
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.160]   Photoshop photo of me that can zoot to click a link.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.560]   So I'm hoping again, my my my standards are dropping.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.280]   My expectations dropping even faster.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:58.280]   So I assume that the actual blog will be back up sooner rather than any minute now.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:03.600]   Andy Inacos relocationary waste of bandwidth.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.040]   Thank you, Andy Merlin Scott.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:08.400]   Alex will be back next week from his trip around the world.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.120]   I'm Leo LaPorte, another Mac break.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.920]   Oh, yes, we'll have news from the Apple announcement on September 9.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.800]   Another Mac break is broke.

[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
