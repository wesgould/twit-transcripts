[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.320]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, episode 214.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.760]   And we've got a massive, ginormous panel of people
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.720]   starting up in the upper left corner to block Alex Lindsey
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.920]   from thepixacore.com and pixacore.tv for his podcast.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.920]   Where are you today, Alex?
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.960]   It looks like you're teaching a class or something.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.520]   We can't hear a word Alex is saying.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.920]   And apparently, he can't hear me either.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.560]   He can hear me.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.840]   But I can't hear you.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.880]   The turtle called Gamera is a portrait.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.360]   Can you hear me now?
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.200]   Yes.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.800]   So--
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.840]   Oh boy, the lip sync's terrible.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.960]   My lip sync's terrible?
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.640]   Well, it's OK.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.640]   I can live with it.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.560]   Let's start over again.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.080]   We're only 30 seconds into it.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.800]   I reserve the right.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.240]   Normally, we don't do this.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.720]   OK.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.840]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the show that covers all
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.240]   your apple needs from soup to nuts and everything
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.560]   in between in a massive panel today starting
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.960]   in the upper left-hand corner.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.000]   Alex Lindsey to block.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.080]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.920]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.720]   From thepixacore.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.280]   Are you teaching?
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.960]   What are you doing today?
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.480]   You're not here.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.160]   I'm flying out tomorrow morning to Tokyo.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.240]   And so I am getting ready for that.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.920]   And we're filling out what's called a carne,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.160]   which means that we can take all of our gear
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.640]   with us to Japan.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.440]   And so I'm kind of in the middle of that.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.080]   And I wasn't able to be in Petaluma
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.040]   and then be down here at the same time.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.520]   So carne is stuck in the office.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.760]   Carne is like for customs benefit.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.320]   Yeah, when you're taking $30,000, $20,000 worth
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.720]   of equipment in and out, customs wants to know--
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.200]   wants you to check in and check out.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.360]   Or they get paranoid.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.240]   The lovely, chortle of Mr. Andy
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.080]   and not go from a celestial waist to bandwidth
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.000]   and, of course, a Chicago sun times.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.160]   Tote Fields, Brazil.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.880]   Are we still doing all the square?
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.520]   Scent of square to block.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.400]   Paul Lind.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.480]   Tote Fields.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.400]   No, I believe Canada gets more rainfall than South America
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.800]   Conject.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.000]   And let's see, moving right along to the lower right hand
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.200]   corner, a new beyond here.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.840]   Justin Williams, he's with Second Gear Software
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.440]   at secondgearssoftware.com.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.160]   And two of his programs have been picked.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.360]   One on Mac Break Weekly, the Today program,
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.600]   the Todo list program.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.800]   And on iPad Today, I picked Elements, which
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.120]   was text editing powered by Dropbox, just updated,
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.480]   by the way.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.240]   Great software.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.160]   He also does Markdown Mail, which
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.040]   looks really cool for the iPhone.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.800]   And check off a Todo list, a simple Todo list program
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.240]   for the Mac.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.560]   Hello.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.640]   It's great to have you, Justin.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.720]   Welcome to the program.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.640]   Thank you for having me.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.560]   I've been growing my developer, Neckbeard, all week for this.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.120]   You need to work a little hard.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.720]   Secondgearssoftware.com.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.120]   We wanted-- this was actually Merlin Man.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.920]   Suggested Merlin Man.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.480]   In the lower right-hand corner.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   Hello, Merlin.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:16.980]   Hi.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.480]   How are you?
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.960]   I'm very happy that you had Justin on.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.080]   He's a very smart young man.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.320]   You suggested, I think quite rightly,
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.720]   that we are always talking about developer stuff,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.360]   but we never have an actual developer on the show.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.920]   So it probably is a good idea to actually ask somebody
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   who's writing software.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.160]   How long have you been developing for the Mac, Justin?
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.760]   I started back in 2006 when I graduated from Purdue.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.480]   And I wasn't much of a student, and I didn't really
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.600]   go to too many job fairs.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.240]   And I graduated, and it basically seemed, well,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.720]   I know how to do this software development stuff.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.200]   So let's just file those LLC papers and get to developing.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.120]   So I've been doing it since then.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.200]   A lot of people-- I just saw an article about the decision
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.240]   between iOS and Android now.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.200]   Does that come up for you?
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.080]   Do you start to look at-- with a longing at the growing, fast
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.000]   growing Android platform at any point?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.080]   I don't look at it longing, but I
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.360]   keep track of all the platforms.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.400]   I started doing the Mac development,
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.840]   and I moved on to iOS, which really has paid off.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.520]   I am interested in the other platforms.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.600]   Android, I've tested the waters a little bit with development,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.120]   but I just-- I never liked it.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.480]   I kind of like webOS with the Palm stuff, but--
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.600]   Ah, and they really don't have the market share.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.120]   But I am-- I'm interested in Windows Phone 7,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.440]   and I'm hoping to see what the BlackBerry tablet has to offer
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.240]   as well.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.680]   HP says it's going to print a ship.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.040]   What was it?
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.040]   1.2 billion Palm OS-- WebOS printers.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.200]   Printers?
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.040]   I don't really want to develop for printers,
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.040]   but if they come out with a new Palm pre or something like that,
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.920]   I might look into it.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.080]   I'm sure they will.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.440]   Can we help you, Merlin?
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.680]   It seems like he's dialing the phone.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.200]   I don't know why.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.840]   No, that wasn't me.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.120]   Are you calling for help this early in the show?
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.640]   Don't you--
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.680]   Don't you--
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.720]   Get me out of this!
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.720]   Are you calling your agent saying, who put me?
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.560]   I didn't touch anything.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.320]   Why are you looking at me?
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.760]   Who put me on this show?
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.320]   I think it was actually me.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.360]   Uh-huh.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.800]   I don't know what I was doing, though.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.520]   I was going to look at a web page,
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.600]   we're getting ready for the next story, and I clicked it,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.200]   and see--
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.000]   Oh, I get it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.280]   I don't know why.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.320]   Sorry about that, Merlin.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.960]   I apologize to me.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.400]   You may remove the Scarlet letter from your vest.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.680]   I won't do it anymore.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.760]   Scarlet Octothorp.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.480]   All right.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.360]   Let's talk.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.200]   Let's talk stories, news.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.840]   Yesterday, in fact, we covered it live.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.600]   I was very pleased to say that RIM announced it's going to do
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.160]   a tablet PC.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.360]   They call it the business tablet.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.920]   This is to compete with the iPad, obviously.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.040]   Won't be out till next year.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.200]   Won't even run oddly enough BlackBerry OS.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.720]   They call it the Playbook.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.880]   Seven inches does have multi-touch.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.800]   It's using an oddball OS that they recently acquired.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.000]   Maybe I shouldn't call it oddball.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.200]   I'm just not familiar with it.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.280]   And it's going to be interesting.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.880]   It's going to have Flash.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.320]   They say the full web.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.760]   That's code.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.360]   Did they give us a price?
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.200]   They did not give us a price to my knowledge, unless somebody
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.920]   knows about it.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.680]   I wonder why.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.520]   I've looked in all day and I have about even a hint of it.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.080]   10/20.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.680]   We're going to offer a price yet, which is smart,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.880]   because if they want to offer a price now, when it actually
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.160]   comes out, they're going to be competing with the next generation
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.600]   iPad.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.400]   And who knows what that's going to cost?
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.640]   An expiration iPad, HB, WebOS tab, and probably two others
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.480]   that are announced but haven't shipped yet.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.920]   Interestingly, though, it does not ship with 3G.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.640]   It ships with Wi-Fi, but it will pair to a BlackBerry phone
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.240]   with 3G.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.480]   That's one of the smartest things, though, and one of the least
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.880]   expensive expected, because one of the things
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.200]   that Samsung and other makers are being kind of home for
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.480]   is the fact that they're-- looks like they're not offering
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.600]   Wi-Fi-only edition.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.000]   So that is not just a $400 thing.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.560]   It's a $400 thing that comes with a two-year contract.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.480]   And one of the things they're really going to have to compete
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.600]   with is the idea that if you're trying to convince someone not
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.320]   to buy a $499 iPad that you will in free and clear
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.560]   and no other commitments.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.080]   So that's very smart on their part.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.640]   It will have dual cameras, 3 megapixel front-facing,
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.160]   5 megapixel rear-facing, supports 1080p, HD video,
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.000]   recording.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.560]   That can't be right.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.360]   That's got to be upscale.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.480]   I think that's why the HDMI output--
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   I don't believe that's your point.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.120]   No playback, yes.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.400]   But it says recording right here.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.360]   I'm looking at the specs.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   Let's try it through the camera.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.320]   The camera could do 1080p.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.400]   It's doing all kinds of--
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.120]   I mean, when you look at any of the--
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.960]   you get little flips and all those other stuff.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.520]   I mean, there's--
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.440]   Yeah, there's--
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.880]   Even they don't bother the 1080.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.560]   They usually just go straight to 720p.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.600]   720p, this says--
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.960]   You can scale it to anything you want and call it 1080p.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.000]   I mean, there's no real standard to the standard.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.280]   That's what I think is going on.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.840]   I mean, I'm anyway.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.920]   Audio for MP3AC and Windows Media,
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.600]   HDMI video output, as you said, anti-Bluetooth 2.1 and EDR,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:01.120]   micro HDMI, micro USB, WebKit.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.640]   I like this.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.200]   I'm going to have to start making those micro HDMI cables,
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.480]   because those are still made manufactured
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.480]   from the unobtainium mines of upper romance.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.040]   I have one.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.880]   I bought one when I bought my Droid X. I bought one,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.120]   because the Droid X also has micro HDMI.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.680]   And it's nice because there's a little app for the--
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.840]   I'm sorry, I do this every time.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.800]   I hate Android.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.360]   Moving on.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.760]   There's a little app on the Droid X
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   that lets you get HDMI out of anything on the screen
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.080]   all the time.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.920]   But no, do any of you actually have--
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.920]   looking at this playbook, or any of you interested
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.040]   in buying one today?
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.640]   Now, Leo, I think you'll buy one just because you buy everything.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.600]   No, I wouldn't buy one today.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.000]   I didn't buy the streak.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.360]   The Dell streak, I should have, because it's--
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.280]   I was really looking at this at the Samsung.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.000]   Didn't buy-- I should have.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.400]   The iPad is so great.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.360]   Now, there's similar-- well, I see asking this crew
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.920]   if they're going to buy it is not relevant,
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.440]   because that, like me, were reviewers.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.200]   I just think that's going to be a good test
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.360]   of two different things.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.880]   Number one is a seven-inch tablet
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.720]   going to be just as attractive as 10-inch.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.880]   But also, is the app store really as important
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.040]   as a lot of Apple people and a lot of pundits
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.560]   are making it out to be?
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.000]   Already, I've heard from Amazon saying
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.680]   that they're definitely coming up with a Kindle app
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.560]   for an end-to-rest on their date, right?
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.360]   There are a couple other different app developers.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.760]   The biggest book reading app for Android
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.480]   has said that they're making a version of it.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.960]   They'll run on this book.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.880]   Maybe it's not necessary to have 200,000 apps,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.080]   as long as you have just the 12 that people deem important.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.440]   As long as Dropbox makes a Dropbox app,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.000]   fill in the blanks for four other services,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.600]   that's going to be another big test.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.840]   If a year from now, it turns out that the biggest asset
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.080]   that Apple has is not really as important as we all thought,
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.960]   it becomes a much wider playing field.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.720]   So I've been waiting for this though.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.840]   For whom is this the answer to a question?
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.000]   Well, we said that about the IQ and CRY about Netflix.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.200]   Oh, gosh, we got these in the netbook.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   So who would ever want an iPhone or who would ever want an iPad?
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.400]   I'm not trying to sound like a partisan,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.200]   but anybody who wants an iPad can get an iPad.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.760]   Anybody who wants a network can get a netbook.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.800]   I'm generally asking, is it just that this is more hackable?
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.000]   I mean, like, well, blackberry, blackberry owners, maybe.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.520]   Yeah, see, I looked at the video.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.080]   And the video of it was actually the video I saw it up
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.120]   on Gizmodo was actually intriguing to me.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.720]   It looked the OS looked like a bit of a mix
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.080]   between WebOS's card metaphor for multitasking
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.240]   and a little bit of iPad.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.720]   Now, obviously, this is a two minute video,
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   so you can't say how good it is in daily use,
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.200]   but it was intriguing enough that I want to keep up with it.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.000]   And I went on their site and I signed up to get access to what
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.120]   they're, I think they're calling it the WebWorks SDK they have.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.280]   Not to say that I'm ever going to build anything for it,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   but I'm actually intrigued by the other tablet platforms
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.480]   just because I want to see others have tablets out there
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.680]   so that Apple doesn't just take the entire market for themselves.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.520]   Well, and I think for me, I think the thing is,
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.920]   is I'm hoping that with this new OS,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.880]   they're going to see a much better interface.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.560]   The touch screens on the past,
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.320]   blackberry stuff has not been compelling.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.080]   What is it?
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.600]   The storm? Those things are awful.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.720]   Yeah, they've got the Storm 3 still trying to make that
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.400]   compete with the iPhone and they haven't succeeded at all yet.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.880]   It's just, it seems, I mean, I don't want to say anything.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.520]   This is smaller, though.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.120]   I don't know anything about the technology or the business,
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.200]   so as usual, I'll talk about it on my butt,
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.160]   but it sounds a little bit risky to put,
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.600]   it seems like to make this thing as responsive and as fast.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.840]   I mean, we all know what went into the iPad to make it like that.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.240]   It just seems like this was going to require some tremendous
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.960]   cycles in terms of development.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.040]   It's going to take a lot of resources to make this thing awesome.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.400]   They acquired a new OS for this particular use.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.920]   The people, the people I know who have blackberries
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.680]   have it for a pretty specific reason.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.480]   I mean, in some cases, it could be just because of security or
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.000]   whatever, but a lot of times, you know, blackberry users are a
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.240]   certain, I don't want to stereotype,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.760]   but I mean, they are very much very task driven,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.080]   really more like Google people and Apple people in some ways.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.040]   They're very task driven.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.160]   They're not really into sitting in anything that they fiddle.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.600]   They do it very efficiently.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.120]   I'm a little bit worried about this video, though.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.360]   I mean, you don't see a real device doing anything for real.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.280]   This is 100% mock up.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.400]   And even the notion of people who do the blue skies,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.520]   solution, hearing stuff, right?
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.760]   Even the notion of guys, they had a working atom to show off a
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.960]   year ago.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.240]   And so that lease says, OK, they've definitely figured out some
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.120]   of the engineering.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.280]   More importantly, they have held one of these things in their
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.800]   hand and they know how well the software works when you have it
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.080]   in your hands like a steering wheel.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.840]   So I don't think that's necessarily an alarming thing,
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.040]   but I would be a lot more interested if they at least had
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.800]   a flash of somebody who was really using something they
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.720]   could actually build at this.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.480]   They're clearly positioning this for business, right?
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.640]   I mean, this is--
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   I think so.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.360]   I wonder if the feeling among RIM and a lot of other companies
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.120]   is not--
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.120]   you know, it's risky, but it's risky if we don't do it.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.120]   It's in Apple.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.200]   It's risky if they appear not to do it.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.040]   That's kind of what I'm getting at, is I wonder if--
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.960]   again, I have no idea.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.720]   But it's just--
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.880]   that's a tremendous amount of development effort to make
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.080]   something that in Apple's case, it was in retrospect.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.320]   People may be perhaps finally admitted it was kind of a
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.600]   no-brainer, including me.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.360]   I didn't see it as a no-brainer at the time, but now--
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:17.840]   Well, that's right.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.160]   I mean, we said the same thing.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.760]   Don't forget.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.080]   We said, who needs this?
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.120]   But as a fit for Apple users, that's a pretty different
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.160]   thing than for the kind of--
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:25.640]   Well, you can ask--
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.280]   Well, you can ask Apple users to buy anything.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.080]   Also, just because we enjoy that famously Catholic
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.320]   experience of--
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.360]   yeah, so go ahead, Andy.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.400]   Sorry.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.280]   Oh, no, you're making a perfectly good point.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:39.920]   The only--
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.080]   I mean, it's--
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.760]   there are so many different devices where you can't really--
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.600]   the only way you can explain why I need it is to simply say
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.960]   here.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.600]   And then people can really suss out whether or not there's
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.960]   a hole in their life that is exactly this shape, size, and
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.600]   width.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.280]   It's an interesting announcement.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.280]   I think they're just trying to get people to not make a
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.000]   purchase over the holidays that they might have been ready
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   to make.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.880]   They've been waiting for six months to say, you know what?
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.920]   I'm buying a couple iPads for Christmas.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.200]   But now that we have no pricing, we have no physical
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.600]   object that they're showing off.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.000]   Also, the only release date they're giving is sometime in
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.840]   2011.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.360]   It could be December.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.280]   I think this is like the chess move that says, I don't--
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.600]   I don't need my piece to be in this spot, but I just want to
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.800]   make sure no one else takes this spot on the board.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.600]   Media coverage of Apple--
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.960]   Do you think this is a consumer?
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.480]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:29.840]   Moving on.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.960]   Media coverage of Apple found to be shocking, overwhelmingly
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   positive.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.560]   The Pew Research--
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.560]   They're not my break.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.520]   Not here.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.680]   Not here, my friend.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.560]   The Pew Research Center on Monday released the findings of a
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.400]   new study analyzing tech journalism in 437 stories from a
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.960]   variety of sources from June 1 through 2009 through 30th
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.720]   of 2010.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.440]   The study found that Apple receives the most press in the
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.880]   mainstream media, 15.1% of all technology stories in the news,
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.560]   even though Apple's represent--
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:58.960]   I don't know--
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.880]   X% of computers out there.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.560]   Google came in second with 11.4%.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.480]   Then Twitter--
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.000]   You want to say over coverage.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.080]   Twitter-- 7% of coverage.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.520]   Facebook-- only 4.8 Microsoft-- 3% of coverage.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.200]   This is even better.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.600]   Of stories analyzed, 42%.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.960]   Almost half described Apple as, quote, innovative and
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.880]   superior.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.600]   27% praised the company's loyal fans, as we just did.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.800]   I just did.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.600]   Only 20% of stories about Google portrayed the search giant as
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.800]   having innovative and superior products.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.960]   I just want to say that for all people that are complaining
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.400]   about us, everybody's doing it.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.480]   It's not just us.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.840]   Well, this is a Mac show.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.680]   This is an Apple show.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.720]   We have to cover Apple.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.320]   It's just our job.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.080]   The complaint that we should be addressing is that people who
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.400]   say, why does Windows weekly talk about Apple?
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.720]   That's the real question.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.120]   But Apple gets all this press because people go and click on
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.480]   the links that are about Apple stories.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.120]   If people were clicking more links on Microsoft, people
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.480]   would write about it a lot more.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.600]   That's what seems kind of obvious to me.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.800]   And obviously, I think that they're getting the praise
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.320]   because you can't really find too many people that are going
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.800]   to say the iPhone is not a really great product.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.400]   Well, let me ask, as somebody who's actually a member of the
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.320]   actual newspaper press corps, are you charged Andy with
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.840]   Apple coverage or with general tech coverage at the show
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.840]   sometimes?
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.520]   I'm general tech.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.320]   I'm sort of like their Roger Ebert for technology.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.040]   Not the beat, not the quality of course.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.000]   And I would guess the preponderances stories you do are
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   about Apple.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.080]   Well, a lot of them are only because I try to choose things
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.080]   that I think are, for lack of a better word, newsworthy.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.880]   So you agree with Justin?
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.360]   Yeah, there are two things that, from my perspective here,
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.080]   when Apple comes up with an iPad, it is a brand new thing we
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.440]   really haven't seen before.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.680]   Apple has a really great track record of breaking new ground.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.240]   And so I'll write a column not only about the event in which
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.640]   they release it, but also will, of course, write my usual
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.440]   18,000 words about it as soon as it's released.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.360]   And I've had some time to play with it.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.920]   If Dell wants to give me their--
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.280]   they send me a press release saying that we now have the
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.680]   Dell XJ1 Model 3, which is not to be confused with the XJL
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:23.080]   Model 3.4, which is an Office Max only release.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:23.680]   It's OK.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.480]   It's a Windows Notebook.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.960]   It has specs that may or may not be different from another
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.680]   model that I saw last month.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.720]   It doesn't really break any new ground.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.200]   Sometimes it is a challenge, though, to make sure that you
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:39.120]   have that wide spectrum of interests and items.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.680]   The column is going to be things that are interesting me to
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.960]   preponderance of everything else.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.640]   But I have to make sure that I balance that out.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.880]   I'm just glad to see that there's a BlackBerry tablet that
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.640]   looks kind of interesting.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.640]   There's a Dell tablet coming out.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.160]   Notionik is something that I'm following a lot because they
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.640]   seem to be positioning themselves very well as a tablet.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.360]   That's not necessarily an iPad, but seems to have figured out
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.320]   how to do an Android tablet really, really well.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.040]   So again, you've got to make news in order to get a
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.120]   news person to write about you.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.640]   Well, one last thing.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.240]   Apple will actually help you out with an article not by--
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.160]   you have to kiss their butt.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.960]   But they will actually give you information.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.120]   And if you ask them for a review unit to have--
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.200]   your deadline is in two weeks, they will not make you wait
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.960]   two months before they even reply to an email.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.040]   Unless you're a college kid.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.520]   Which case-- Steve Jobs, personally.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.640]   I have an assignment.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.640]   And I'm going to give you a personal interview.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.360]   I only need an hour of your time.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.240]   That's not too valuable, is it?
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.360]   This portion of the Mac Break Weekly brought to you by our
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.400]   friends at Citrix.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.200]   Go to my PC, my friends.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.640]   Many of us, our jobs aren't just from 9 to 5.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.240]   We work around the clock.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.160]   An idea comes to you.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.920]   You want to get to work on it.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.800]   Do something about it, even if it's 4 in the morning.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.360]   But sometimes the problem is your home, the office
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.960]   computer, is at the office.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.720]   Or maybe you're traveling.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.200]   Or maybe you just want to go home early and sit by the pool
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.000]   and get some work done.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.200]   That's what Go to My PC is for.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   Means you can get to your office computer, whatever
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.360]   computer you put it on.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.120]   Any time you want anywhere, you can get online.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.640]   Even if it's a PC at the office and you've got a Mac
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.040]   book at home or vice versa.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.440]   Go to My PC means you get what you need to do done, wherever
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.040]   or whenever the mood strikes you.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.280]   You can access your office or home computer in all the files
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.520]   and applications from wherever you are, no matter where you
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.000]   are, as long as you get online.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.480]   Even from an internet cafe, because it's 128-bit SSL, so
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.520]   you don't have to worry about security.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.400]   You can run any program access, any network resource.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.400]   You can send and receive email.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.440]   This is what I used to like to do.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.960]   I don't have to do anymore because I'm the boss.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.160]   I bet this is what my employees do.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.280]   They'll go home.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.440]   But then log on to the office computer and send an email.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.800]   Like it's 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9 PM.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.640]   It looks like they're late at work, but really they're not.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.440]   They're just messing with me.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.080]   Go to My PC.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.120]   You can mess with your boss, too.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.520]   Go to MyPC.com/Macbreak.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.040]   You could try it free for 30 days.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.280]   Go to MyPC.com/Macbreak.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   30 days free.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.720]   We thank the etrics so much for their support of Macbreak
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.560]   Weekly.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.680]   Leo will report here with Andy Inato, Alex Lindsay,
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.280]   the lovely and talented Merlin Mann.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.320]   I'm trying to poke you in the ear right there.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.320]   Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.360]   Merlin, if you stand up, it'll look like your toe
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.520]   or your toe is actually Alex's because you're wearing
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   the same shirt and you're positioning about the same right
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:30.760]   way.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.600]   Oh, let's see.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.680]   Oh, no, we're that.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.200]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.880]   Oh, that's so-- for those of you not watching at home,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.920]   how does it feel, Alex?
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.960]   Enjoying that?
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.800]   Mm.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.480]   Here we go.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.040]   Alex, ready?
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.440]   OK, Alex.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   Anyway.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   Anyway.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.520]   Are you wearing my--
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:51.960]   That's what I do here.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   I tried to keep things moving along.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.320]   I wasn't fast enough.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.120]   The problem was I was looking in the wrong screen.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.200]   And I just--
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.080]   And try it again.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.720]   I'll get out of the way.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.680]   Maybe I was in the way.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.280]   I'm ready, Merlin.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.280]   This time, ready.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.280]   Oh, God.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.280]   I was talking to Leo.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.680]   And Justin Williams is wondering what the--
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.440]   oh, he's going to do it.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.720]   Oh, look.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.280]   Oh, that's creepy.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.000]   There you go.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.960]   That's freaking creepy.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.280]   That's disgusting.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.840]   All right, really.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.640]   Welcome back to the--
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.200]   Thank you, back.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.000]   Welcome back to that.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.880]   Justin Williams is here for second gear software.com,
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.720]   wondering what the hell he has gotten himself into.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.480]   My deepest is--
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.200]   Are we going to have a chance to talk about Justin's app?
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.480]   Because I want to pummel all of my feature requests
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.160]   out of in front of lots of people.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.480]   Which one today?
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:32.980]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.960]   We don't have to today.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   But you know, he makes some really cool.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.760]   No, the program--
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:36.800]   See?
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.360]   This is turning into--
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.760]   This is the worst thing about naming an app today,
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.160]   is that you have--
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.560]   is like my app is called today.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.000]   When do you want to talk about it?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.720]   It's today.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.200]   Do you want to talk--
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.160]   But when-- but let's talk about it today.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.840]   It's baseball class.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.680]   Got a lot of crazy names.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.120]   You did it.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.400]   I'm nervous, didn't you, really, man?
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.680]   See, he's always thinking.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.160]   Always thinking.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.320]   It's the same of your project manager.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.160]   What?
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.800]   App app.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.240]   The app--
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:00.800]   The app you want to go through.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.840]   I just ordered one.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.440]   And you can, too, Apple TV shipping,
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.280]   although if you order today, ships in two to three weeks.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.840]   So there's a little bit of a supply issue.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.160]   But we are hearing from the internets
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.800]   that people are getting their email
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.760]   saying your Apple TV is on its way to you.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.280]   Andy, you got yours yet?
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.160]   Oh, I really can't say this.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   That's a yes, by the way.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.360]   Just so you know.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.280]   We have a little trick.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.160]   He does this thing.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.840]   And then the thing, and the thing.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.160]   So they won't let you talk about it yet?
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.680]   Oh, he can't even say that.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.280]   I'll repeat my boilerplate.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.600]   As an ongoing basis, since pre-iPad, whenever
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.160]   there is a question asked of me whether or not I have
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.400]   a pre-release product that I may or may not have,
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.960]   my answer will always be I cannot confirm or deny
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.920]   that it's possible that I actually don't have one,
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.440]   but I'm trying to throw you off for the next time
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.400]   that I do have it.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:51.920]   It's possible.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.240]   I do have it, and I can't talk about it.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.960]   By the way, Andy was also at bin 38 last week,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.880]   colluding with those angels.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.640]   Super angels.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.240]   Here's an interesting little--
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.120]   Yes, I was busing table search.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.960]   Big tip for that Harrington guy.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.400]   Here's an interesting story.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.560]   Apple, for the first-- you know, they released the remote app.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.000]   Ages ago, they have updated it.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.520]   Apple Remote 2.0, now updated.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.400]   If you use this, it's a great little app.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.160]   In fact, we talked about it because it was kind of interesting
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.400]   that only there was one guy who worked on it,
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.360]   and he's moved on other things, so they hadn't updated it
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.000]   in a year.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.720]   You can control iTunes and your Apple TV.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.320]   Now, it works on iPhone.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.880]   As always, iPod Touch, iPad.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.680]   The Retin displays now, shared libraries and iTunes
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.400]   and the new Apple TV.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.240]   So this is good.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.000]   They needed to do this before the release of Apple TV.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.080]   It's pretty hot.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.520]   I was using it this morning on my iPad.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.520]   And not only does it really make you think
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.360]   that you're actually looking at your iTunes window on your iPad,
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.600]   I started something playing just from the standard collection
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.800]   of playlists where I would normally find them.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.360]   And then there is no noise coming out of my computer
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.600]   next to it on the desk.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.320]   I think, oh, God, what's muted now?
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.640]   Nope, the iPad is muted.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.480]   Nope, this isn't muted.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.920]   Oh, what have I done wrong now?
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.960]   It was smart enough that the volume control set
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.800]   in the iTunes app, whatever it is, in the remote app,
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.720]   designates what the volume of the iTunes app
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.560]   on the laptop is going to be.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.800]   So the fact that the little slider in the iTunes window
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.120]   on my iPad was set to zero, over-road, whatever was set
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   on the other one to make sure there would always--
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.720]   that's just well-done.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.760]   That's really nice.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   Yep.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.320]   That's how it works.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.280]   Already, we have people complaining
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.600]   that they're using the same bland-looking iTunes icon
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.680]   as iTunes 10.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.880]   They are.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.480]   It's a helicopter that folds into a briefcase.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.040]   You're complaining about the color.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.200]   Who is phone leather?
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.280]   It's a helicopter that folds into a briefcase.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:59.800]   TV executives weighing in on the 99-cent rentals.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.960]   Viacom Chief Executive, Phil Domo,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.440]   at the Goldman Sachs Conference, says, it doesn't work for us.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.400]   He probably said it like this.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.760]   He doesn't work for us.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.960]   It is stupid.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.320]   It is with or not going to do it.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.240]   Viacom owns cable networks like Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.760]   He says, we spend a lot of money.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.560]   We value our content a lot.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.640]   We don't think Apple has it quite right yet.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.040]   On the other hand--
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.600]   Lovely.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.640]   Is this your dog?
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.640]   Is this your dog?
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.120]   Does your dog bite?
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.520]   It's like the Disney world.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.360]   It's a smart world, after all, of culturally insensitive
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.240]   voices today.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.960]   I love it.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.480]   I did get an email from--
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.000]   I did get a very, very angry email from Russian
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.320]   who said, your depiction of Russians, which
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.080]   is basically a ripoff of Boris Badenoff from Rocky and Bull
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   and go, your depiction of Russians is racist.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.200]   And I have unsubscribed to all your podcasts.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.120]   OK, getting back to Apple TV.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   Oh, yes.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.120]   OK.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.320]   I got an old one in Drupco.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.880]   I got a really interesting email from Roku about 20 minutes.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.960]   I was going to say 20 minutes into the show,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.560]   but actually 20 minutes before we actually--
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.520]   20 past two and 20 minutes before we actually
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.240]   started recording.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.640]   Exactly.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.440]   And so announcing a deal where Hulu Plus will be available
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.520]   to all Roku box owners starting this fall--
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.320]   This was rumored.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.400]   That's exciting.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.840]   And that includes NBC content.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.480]   That includes Fox content.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.320]   So when they say, oh, we're examining the issue,
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.200]   but all numbers are uncrunched the way that Apple--
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.120]   they're saying, no, we really think this $10 all you can eat
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.760]   is really the way we want to do it.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.960]   Now, that doesn't include Viacom, does it?
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.320]   I don't believe it, of course.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.120]   You can watch the Daily Show on Hulu, can you?
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.320]   I think you can.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.600]   NBC shows list list list.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.760]   Fox shows like Glee Family Guys, The Office, 30 Rock,
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.720]   X Files, Law and Order, Rest of Development,
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.840]   SNL, my device.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.240]   Ooh, my device, yes.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.200]   But yeah.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.480]   Your money is already on Netflix.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.000]   Crockett and Tubbs.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   All of it.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.160]   Crockett and Tubbs.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.680]   And Tubbs.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.280]   It's for charging you on the vices.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   No.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.280]   But that is interesting.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.800]   How about Mad Men?
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   I do not know.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.240]   That's A&E, but that would be nice.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.560]   AMC.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.840]   I think that Viacom should get the money while it's still there.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:18.920]   I think that the--
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.200]   It's the new issue.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.840]   Because 99%-- they might add up to at least enough
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.880]   for a couple of cups of coffee.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   I mean, I think that the real issue that I think a lot of these
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.080]   content companies haven't really grappled with yet
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:34.080]   is the fact that I think that content, its value for sale
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.680]   or any of these other things is going to go away.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.000]   I mean, it's-- the problem that you have is you have someone
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.880]   like me who's got 400 things on my Netflix.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.560]   If Mad Men isn't available, I'll wait until it is.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.240]   And so I got plenty to watch.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.160]   I got more than I can watch on a lifetime on my Netflix right
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:48.680]   now.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.440]   And that instant access is going to kill the industry.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.080]   And kill a certain part of it.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.880]   Sorry.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.040]   I'm moving it along only because A&E's going to--
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.480]   We've got to get rid of A&E about 45 minutes.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.000]   I'm trying to get the show in.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.880]   Jam, this entire fabulous show into a mere four or five
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.400]   hours of content.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.520]   Les Moomves, CEO of CBS, says--
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.400]   What we said to them and the Apple guys are terrific.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.600]   And obviously, the application is terrific.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.560]   So let's see what happens.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.120]   Moomves said-- this is a direct quote, folks.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.760]   I'm not making this cover.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.760]   There are two networks in and two networks not in.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.240]   Let's see what happens.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.840]   And maybe we'll talk again in January.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.440]   Maybe we'll talk again next year.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.520]   That's what he said.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.240]   This is a quote.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   The senator has withdrawn from the re-election campaign
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.240]   announcing a desire to spend more time with his family.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.080]   I know.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.480]   OK, that's not the real-- that's the line that came up
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.560]   with because they didn't want to say, oh, it's on.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.040]   It's on like Donkey Kong.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.800]   OK.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.600]   So you think your opinion, Alex Lindsey,
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.480]   is that these guys are whistling through the graveyard.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.200]   It's over, and we don't really care what they do.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.160]   Yeah, it's not tomorrow.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.440]   But I think that the thing is, I think
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.600]   that when we look at the trajectory,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.000]   I think one of the big challenges for the music industry
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.720]   is not just that people are hired in their software.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.600]   It's that people like me have an entire iPod full of all
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.040]   the music that we've ever listened to on our entire lifetime.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.920]   Ever will buy, ever again.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   We're done.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.880]   No, it gives something really stand out as well.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   But I'm not looking for radio stations anymore.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.400]   Right.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   Can you play with that?
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.400]   I guess that's how you pronounce it.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.200]   R-D-I-O, if you play with that.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.080]   I like R-D-I-O.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.000]   I recommended it a couple of days.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.800]   How do you pronounce it?
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.240]   You say radio.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:31.900]   R-D-O.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.880]   They don't want to get it.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.640]   It's R-D-O.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.640]   Weirdly.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.080]   I think that's the app that I got.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.320]   So basically, it's $10 a month.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.240]   All you can eat.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.800]   Yeah, and it has offline caching.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.960]   So basically, you can put--
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   it doesn't have everything.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.200]   There's a lot of stuff missing.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.600]   But you could basically download-- what did I download?
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.760]   Just, I got a Kinks box set.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.800]   Like this like 5 CD Kinks box set just
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.040]   shows up on there, like a 10 Dillon record
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.760]   to show up on there.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.720]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.240]   I love it.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.600]   It's really awesome.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.680]   Now, two things.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.440]   First of all, it's made me rethink
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.160]   how much of my actual iTunes--
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.560]   because amongst my friends, my HIPRA friends,
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.800]   more and more of my friends don't even carry stuff around
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.080]   on-- they don't download stuff, quote unquote.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.200]   Like they used to, they stream.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.040]   So I've-- and then B, you have to make a decision about that
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.120]   because otherwise, you're going to fill up your phone
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.760]   really, really, really fast.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.320]   In my case, I actually hit the edge.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.120]   I hit like I filled my phone for the first time.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.840]   Do you have a 32 gig?
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.240]   I don't know.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:29.760]   You might have to say it.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.760]   It doesn't.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.360]   Anyway, I like it.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.120]   It's a nice phone.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.760]   But my problem with audio was I had a subscription
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.720]   for about two months.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.960]   And I really liked the service.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.200]   And I never-- I didn't really run into too many issues
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.680]   where I was running out of music that I wanted to listen to.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.720]   But the most frustrating aspect I had with it
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.160]   was to use their air desktop player.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.120]   You always had to log into the website
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.000]   and start playing the music from there.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.960]   And usually, whenever I'm launching iTunes
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.680]   or some sort of music service, I want
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.560]   to click a button.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.000]   I want to go to a random play, hit play,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.560]   and just have it play any music in my library.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.520]   It was a lot more effort for that in audio
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.360]   than it was in iTunes.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.120]   I totally agree with you, Justin.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.560]   It feels really pretty janky on the desktop.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:07.800]   It's not.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.680]   It's a pretty app.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.080]   And the fact that it controls through your iTunes library
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.840]   and looks for what you might have is cool.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.200]   I wish you gave me the option of saying,
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.120]   don't give me stuff that's just clip only.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.640]   But the second thing I was going to say is this
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.720]   is the first app in a pretty long time that's legal,
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.800]   that made me go, wow, this industry, or these industries,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.920]   are actually fighting on a lot more fronts than I realized.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.960]   And I bet more fronts than a lot of them realize.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.520]   Because if you think about it, it's not as simple as,
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.840]   I don't want to pay for music.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.360]   Because I do pay for music.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.480]   It's a question of immediacy.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.040]   It's a question of variety.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.400]   It's a question of fungibility.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.640]   It's so easy to try and fight this one more of going,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.520]   oh, you guys are thieves and we're awesome.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.680]   But actually, this app is disruptive.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.560]   It was the beginning of disruption in a really serious way,
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.880]   if it's legal.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.640]   I don't know.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.400]   I agree.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:32:59.920]   It is legal.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.760]   And what's interesting is it's basically
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.920]   a subscription service that Apple refuses to do.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.480]   I discovered a lot more music with my two months on audio
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.080]   than I ever have on paying.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.200]   It's great for discovery.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.160]   It was great because I discovered all these new artists
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.240]   that I would have never heard of just because other people
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.480]   that were using the service were recommending them
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.280]   or my friends were recommending them.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.000]   And if you go to the iTunes top charts,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.680]   it's usually you're going to see Lady Gaga and Keisha.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.520]   You also see when they--
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.040]   My art is just in Bieber.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.640]   I see a lot just because my friends,
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.040]   new albums get uploaded.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.240]   And so in my little--
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.520]   it's actually a not useless social network, which is rare.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.120]   And it's actually a function.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.680]   And so as you get new records, it uploads that.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.600]   And you see it in this annoying Facebook stream.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.840]   But I see Burielle and I got this new album.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.120]   I'm going to go check that out.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.680]   You got a local chart just for your friends.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.200]   It's my contention that what makes social networks suck
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.960]   is that they never make sense until it's
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.880]   about your friends and what you care about.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.520]   And that's why no matter how great Facebook ever gets,
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.040]   I'll always not care that much about it.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.920]   But I don't love everything on Twitter,
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.200]   but I love my friends on Twitter.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   Are audio?
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:06.720]   Are you?
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.920]   Are you-- is great at that because it's totally contextual.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.360]   It's about do-- help me find the people who love the same music
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:11.560]   as me.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.280]   I'm talking too much.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:12.440]   Sorry.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.280]   What about paying?
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.920]   The new ping on iTunes.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.520]   I had to--
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.040]   Cancelled it.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:16.520]   Cancelled it.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.280]   Cancelled ping.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.160]   Now they have now.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.480]   You see now they have this sidebar.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.440]   You could click on a song in your library and nothing will happen.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.080]   Well, it's supposed to-- something--
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.120]   it's nothing happened.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.520]   I guess-- I guess--
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.280]   This cheap trick song.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:31.800]   You have to be playing it.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.960]   You have to be playing it.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.320]   We play some cheap trick and see if anything happens here.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.240]   Nothing here.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.080]   Maybe it's because it's cheap trick.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.440]   How about Charlie Daniels' band?
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.160]   The devil went down.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.960]   This is-- now you're seeing a little bit about me
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.200]   that you perhaps didn't know.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   Oh, look.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.640]   There's a little-- I could say I like it.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.200]   I could post.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.880]   I could show artist profile.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.880]   So there's now some new stuff in ping a little bit.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.360]   I mean, the ping is the thing.
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.480]   I mean, the reason that I like ping
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.920]   is that I think of songs that I want to talk about,
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.720]   that have some historical interest to me.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.640]   And I go to the song.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.360]   I just search the song, find the song, and I just--
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.680]   Can you explain to me why when I-- it says,
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.120]   I just purchased the song We On Fire by Shamillionaire,
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.600]   by the way.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.440]   Love.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.600]   I don't know if you guys are familiar with the oeuvre
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.960]   of Shamillionaire.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.960]   But it's awesome.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.040]   So what's weird about it-- hey, it's not me, it's them.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.760]   What's weird about it is-- it says, I purchased the song
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.000]   and now I can buy it again, which I think is kind of cool.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.960]   So I guess $1.99 purchase wasn't enough for Apple.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   Well, as the resident expert of the mainstream music market,
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.280]   as I am inundated by Justin Bieber fans all day long--
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.640]   Why is that?
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.880]   Well, if you--
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.960]   Did you do something to encourage that?
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.040]   Nice of you to ask Leo.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.960]   Well, if you go to twitter.com/justin, which is my first--
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.720]   Oh, you know Justin.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.320]   And if you do a search at replies,
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.240]   you will see hundreds upon hundreds of tweets a day
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.600]   from little tween girls who just love Justin Bieber.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.800]   And they always are going on and on about how many times
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.040]   they've purchased his latest song on iTunes.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.360]   And they wish--
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.080]   Oh, Justin, Justin, Justin.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.920]   Can I just say you're missing a really, really big opportunity
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.520]   here?
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.160]   You just have your actual picture and your actual name.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.600]   Can I just say--
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.680]   If you just-- what do you think I'm doing for Halloween?
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.760]   There should be a little devil on your left shoulder
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.720]   and then another devil on your right shoulder.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.200]   And then a dugout with other devils
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.680]   waiting to get into the game.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.080]   Oh, man.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.120]   Just get with like--
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.760]   I've been dealing with this for about two years.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.400]   And everyone's always like, well, why don't you just change
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:39.920]   your name?
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.040]   Why don't you just change your name?
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.280]   Well, I'm waiting for--
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.960]   I'm waiting for him to get his driver's license
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.840]   and back up a dump truck of money to my house.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.760]   Anytime anybody talks to you, it's Justin Bieber.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.720]   We would also accept it.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.960]   I'm waiting for him to get a car and then
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.200]   crash into something while drinking something he should not
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.600]   have been drinking at that age.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.720]   Just a word to florisk.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.760]   Justin is not--
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.960]   Justin Bieber!
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.600]   He's not going to follow you.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.040]   Justin--
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.480]   You should just have a bot that just
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.200]   ought to respond.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.640]   It always just says you're dead to me.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.680]   Melissa talks about Justin Bieber.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.920]   Melissa's handle is Bieber's love cash.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.640]   Oh, there's some great ones.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.440]   Every now and then, they'll just send one straight to me
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.960]   and I'll actually reply to them and have some fun.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.640]   It's how I get my jollies every now and then.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.160]   Goodness.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.880]   There's so many Bieber-related things.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.280]   I don't know who this person is.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.720]   I don't know.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.880]   I mean, I know he's got a famous kid with a weird haircut.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.280]   But if you go to the Twitter homepage
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   when you're not logged in and see that little flow of awful
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.960]   toots that are on the homepage, like half of them
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.800]   are not only about Justin Bieber, but they're like,
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   by, I don't know, Bieber bought 5,000 or whatever.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.160]   There's all these Bieber-related properties.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.240]   It's all Sam.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.880]   Here's Kim, who's handle is pure Bieber.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.440]   She says, Justin looks nothing like Justin Bieber.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.400]   Makes me laugh at people say Justin
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.040]   and then they go in like, I'm ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.400]   Sorry.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.040]   My favorite one in the past couple of weeks
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.960]   is the one that replied to me and says, ha ha,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.640]   you're a big nerd.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.240]   Which is true, actually.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.680]   So maybe they should be in the house for you.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.280]   You're right.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.040]   At least they got a professional haircut.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.200]   Oh, and I've been Bieber.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.160]   We have been hijacked by the Bieber.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.840]   Now, let's do a commercial and we'll come back and do more Bieber.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.360]   No, no more Bieber.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.560]   We're done with Bieber.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.040]   We're going to talk--
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.480]   We call that a Bieber hole.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.320]   Used to be rat holes.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.320]   Now it's Bieber holes.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.680]   Now it's time to talk about Drobo.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.180]   Drobo.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.160]   All of your stuff on a Drobo.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.560]   Yes, Drobo.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.440]   The amazing hard drive that is many hard drives
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.840]   combined into one for redundancy and speed.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.120]   And there is a Drobo just right for you
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   if you go to Drobo.com/macbreak.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.000]   You'll see the original, the Drobo S, the Drobo Pro, the new Elite.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.200]   I have a Drobo FS at home.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.960]   I love it.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.280]   I use it to back up all.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.680]   I back up everything in my whole home network on my Drobo FS.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.160]   Take a look at the-- well, the Drobo had four disk space, right?
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.120]   So redundancy.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.360]   But then they went to the Drobo S that
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.240]   had five disk space for better performance
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.640]   and, of course, more storage.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.880]   The Drobo Pro with eight disk bays for small businesses,
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.400]   creative teams.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.600]   Now they've got the Drobo Elite eight disk bays.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.640]   But it's a SAN.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.000]   It's a storage area network.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.960]   It supports up to 16 connections
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.400]   via two gigabit ethernet ports for connecting
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.040]   to hosts using iSCSI, which is very slick.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.160]   VMware certified.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.720]   So you can use it for virtualization.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.800]   In fact, it supports all the different virtualization
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.360]   technologies.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.440]   Drobo's just fantastic.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.720]   And we've got some really great deals.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.320]   You'll save up to $500 on a populated Drobo when you go
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.840]   to Drobo.com/MacBreak.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.400]   I think they have a new one today.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.360]   A new Drobo?
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.720]   A new Drobo.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.520]   Really?
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.240]   Yeah, I think that there's a new Drobo today.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:39:59.720]   Sorry.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:39:59.720]   Sorry.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.240]   Sorry.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   Sorry.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:00.740]   Sorry.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.240]   Sorry.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   Oh my god.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.040]   I'm having a jingle meltdown.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.360]   Sorry about that.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.760]   I pushed too many buttons here.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.600]   OK, let's see.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.000]   Drobo, if I go to Drobo.com, will I see the new one?
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.160]   Ah, I'm trying to flute the blue bottle.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.040]   It's on blue bottles.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.640]   Too much blue bottle.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.720]   I'm just looking at Drobo.com.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.120]   Yeah, I don't see it here, but there's a--
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.480]   I know that there's a new one.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.280]   I know these things.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.840]   The Drobo Pro FS.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.600]   So it's the same as the FS that you have, but it's Pro.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:27.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.640]   VMware certified.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.200]   Those box drives.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.280]   They got even more--
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.440]   They got more drives.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.000]   And it's FS.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.640]   And one of the things that they're doing now
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.120]   is they're doing you seamlessly sync between the two Drobo's.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.480]   So if you have a Drobo at the office and a Drobo at the house,
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.640]   you can have them--
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.000]   like all that software is built in,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.480]   so you don't have to think about it anymore.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:45.880]   It's all done.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.360]   We've been waiting for that because we're
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.840]   going to do offsite at my house.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.320]   Yep.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.280]   Invasive Versa.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.400]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.520]   So D so--
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:41:00.080]   I have the OBO Drobo.com/MacBreak.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.280]   And you'll get up to $500 off a populated Drobo.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.640]   I think I have a song to play.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.280]   DROBODROBO.com/
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.840]   Drama-Feeling-Drilby.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.280]   No other podcast has so many jingles as MacBreak.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.160]   Quickly moving right along down the rundown.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.600]   China gets the iPhone and apparently loves it.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.720]   They didn't like the 3GS.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   Did not sell well, but pre-orders
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.640]   through China Unicon, which is the mainland China phone
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.960]   company, 200,000 sold.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.520]   Another 40,000 sold out in stores.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.080]   You cannot get an iPhone to save your life.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.840]   1,000 people lined up in Beijing at the Apple Store on Friday
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:49.480]   to get the iPhone 4.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.360]   What happened?
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.840]   Didn't they add Wi-Fi into this version?
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.880]   Yeah, but is that really?
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.760]   Was that the distinguishing factor?
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.080]   They got caught up in it.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.200]   They just saw the wave and they--
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.520]   I don't know.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.680]   Weird, though, if you do get the iPhone 4 in China,
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.320]   you will not be able to download your own maps.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:15.160]   It's hardwired with censored Google Maps,
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.640]   the censored data set for China.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.600]   You can't get your own maps in there.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.000]   Yeah, because the town of Frittabette, Arkansas,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.440]   that's a no-tentown structure.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.120]   That was going to cause problems.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.280]   It's an odd thing.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.600]   Yeah, but I was reading about that.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.240]   And that's interesting, where basically they
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.560]   want to use a special Chinese map set that
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.600]   has non-controversial border declarations.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.760]   Oh, I did it.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.760]   That certain regions actually belong to China, not part
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.600]   of another nation.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.600]   Got it.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.120]   And it's--
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:47.600]   Oh, good.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.560]   So Taiwan is just-- is China sound.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.800]   You know, it's one of those things.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.360]   And Tibet is just China.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:53.880]   China.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.360]   It's a border that's making everybody-- somebody mad right
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.360]   now.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.480]   Somebody that's understandably-- because when you move over
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.160]   this way, you're going to push the other guy that way.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.160]   I don't think there's such a thing as a non-controversial--
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.000]   Well, you run the maps, unless you run the country.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:06.680]   Crying out loud.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.440]   The border to my plot of land and my neighbor's plot
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.480]   of land was controversial.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.440]   I keep moving the stakes.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.480]   And he keeps moving back.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.320]   I don't--
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.120]   So yeah.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.400]   One thing that I think is really interesting when
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.480]   you look at this is you hear all this news always about--
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   in any of these countries, that the average person only
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.360]   makes this much money.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.760]   And this will never succeed.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.800]   And the thing is, in every single country,
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.720]   you have a group of people who have crazy money that will
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.880]   spend it on crazy things.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.880]   Somebody said that on Twitter.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.280]   We talked about it on Twitter.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.200]   You know, it's expensive.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.520]   Even subsidized, it's still like $800 in Chinese money.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.040]   Wow.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.320]   It's a lot for us.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.920]   Really a lot for China.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.280]   But I think it was Ryan Block from Gadget GDG2.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.400]   Don't you think they'll--
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.520]   There's no La Garks everywhere.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.120]   Don't you think it's--
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.760]   They had the jailbroken phone forever before they even
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.680]   had the official phone.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.960]   They would be importing them into China.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.640]   Because my wife, she lived in China for about six months
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.120]   last year.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.960]   And she said everywhere she went, people
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.400]   had brought in iPhones.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.080]   We saw that Andy when we were there last summer.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:05.920]   Yep.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.080]   And I bought myself a really good knockoff too for $50.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.640]   So they're-- their entrepreneurship
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.480]   is very, very big for communist nations.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.680]   Well, it's the same in Africa.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   In Africa, when I'm there, a lot of people
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.040]   that I'm dealing with all have iPhones.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.440]   You know, and they don't sell them there.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.560]   I mean, they sell them in South Africa.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.720]   But all these other countries, they're just buying them
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.920]   and jailbreaking them.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.420]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.800]   My theory on this would be--
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.880]   this is just a wild guess.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.240]   But I feel like this one, I was in England.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.600]   And it's like, people eat healthy in England.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.800]   They're like, oh, our portion's mostly very small to you.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.340]   And then they hand you fish and chips
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.200]   in this big thing the size of an infant.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.120]   But I think it's a question of splurging.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.560]   And the thing is, I think everybody
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.000]   splurges on something.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.400]   It's just that some people splurge on really costly stuff.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.800]   And then Americans splurge on costly stuff a lot.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.120]   I think that's probably one difference.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.480]   I'm going to guess.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.320]   Everybody has a mad money thing that they do every once
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:53.840]   and once.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.480]   You know what I mean, though?
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.300]   It isn't like they're going to buy every one of those.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.660]   Maybe they take care of it a little better,
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.100]   keep it a little longer.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:44:59.820]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.340]   I agree.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.260]   It could be just--
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.260]   That's their priority.
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.180]   Well, maybe it's the--
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.580]   I mean, I don't know enough about the culture or the economy
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:06.900]   to say.
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.940]   But people could afford that.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.660]   They're just not going to buy that every month.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:11.300]   We went on--
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:12.980]   I don't know if Andy, if you went on this excursion.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.900]   But during our--
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.140]   no, I guess you weren't on the land tour we did with--
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.460]   Don McAllister was with me.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:21.980]   But we went to a very small town in Guilin Province.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:22.940]   It was agricultural.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.400]   It was a come-quot harvest.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.200]   They've come-quot farmers.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.560]   And went into a house, very modest house.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.520]   The woman to supplement her income
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.560]   made some sort of alcoholic liquor
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.080]   that was native to the area that had snakes in it.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.280]   And the corners of the--
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:39.760]   I'm not kidding.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.520]   The corners of the house filled with jars
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.640]   with fermenting snakes.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:49.480]   And a ginormous Samsung flat-screen TV on the wall.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   And every house I saw had satellite dishes.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.040]   So you're right.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.940]   It's priorities.
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.900]   We were getting ready for a party a few months ago
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.020]   and paid to have a lady come help clean her house.
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.220]   And she pulled up in a Benz.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.660]   You really don't want your house clean.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.380]   We have a 1996 Jedi.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.180]   I just want to be really thorough about that.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.180]   Your maid drives a better car than you.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.700]   How do you feel about that bitch?
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.500]   She's a prosperous Russian lady who just--
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.340]   Because she cleans her own house.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.180]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.900]   There's the difference right there, Andy, isn't it?
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.100]   She saves her money.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.560]   It's not like we have her in all the time.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.080]   So, OK.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.200]   No need to apologize.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.160]   No, we have--
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:26.800]   You hold a car.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.560]   We have some--
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:28.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.520]   No, no, we have some undocumented people for that.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.480]   We keep them in a kennel.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:35.080]   And they get bigger privileges if they earn it.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:35.400]   That's--
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.600]   Oh, geez.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.440]   Oh, gosh.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.600]   You're going to come down on me.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.000]   I know.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.400]   I'm the one who played the song.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.800]   Leo, when you have your own shoe line,
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.440]   you can complain about worker conditions, OK?
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.240]   But when Merlin is trying to do,
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.660]   get that kind of red carpet style at a TJ Maxx price,
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.700]   God bless the work Merlin Man is doing.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.620]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:00.420]   Oh, Google Voice App officially approved--
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.340]   Sorry, get down.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:01.900]   Sit down.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.940]   Sit down, Merlin.
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.500]   I was pointing at my Johnson and a rap like which.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.500]   Sit down.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:10.740]   Are we done with that?
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.260]   I had a question, but we're done with that, right?
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:12.500]   No, we're not done.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.620]   Go ahead.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.020]   I'm just going to hang my head and shame.
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:15.580]   I'll be back.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.380]   I'm always really--
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.840]   This sounds like you look nice today, bit, but it's not.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.360]   I actually am really interested about cultural differences
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.720]   and things that aren't clear to us
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.200]   because we are the dominant culture in the world.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.640]   I mean, yeah, yeah, us.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.440]   But I'm just curious.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.240]   I mean, when you look at things like how iPhone sales go
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.240]   or will somebody adopt the iPad, I mean, how do you--
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.040]   I just-- for example, when the dot com that I worked at
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.360]   decided to quote, unquote, internationalize,
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.200]   they thought it would be as simple as just opening an office
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:42.640]   in Italy.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.480]   And of course, it's incredibly complicated
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.820]   to do business even in the UK compared to the US.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.940]   So I'm just wondering, what kind of factors--
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.380]   I mean, is this too general question?
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.220]   Like, how do you go into a market like China?
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.940]   And how do you decide that what has to change?
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:57.940]   What has to be different?
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.700]   How do you saw it?
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.860]   What are the factors that people look at to decide
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:04.020]   if when to roll this out and to whom?
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.620]   That's probably a really big question.
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.340]   I got Thomas Friedman on the line here.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.300]   And he says, you're understanding
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.660]   a kind of wind of burrito.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.220]   I was Chinese.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.920]   And so now that's a book.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.920]   OK, I don't know.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.680]   Does anybody want to tackle--
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.080]   I think it's a priority of markets.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.520]   I mean, I think you look at where--
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:27.080]   Alex, you know you do a lot of stuff internationally.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.620]   Yeah, I mean, you have to look at--
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.800]   I mean, we're constantly looking at where
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.800]   we're going to do business and how we're going to do it.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.600]   And a lot of that is how easy is it
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.400]   to work with the government?
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.200]   What are the requirements?
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.500]   How big is the market?
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.640]   What is the education level?
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   What is the English level?
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.120]   What is the-- I mean, for us, we're doing production.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.040]   And you really can't do production in other languages.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.900]   It's not so much like can we bend them to our will,
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.380]   but are we a good fit for each other?
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.820]   Yeah, you really look at that because they're
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.460]   too big to really get into can you bend it?
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.460]   What are government--
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.220]   That's a costly mistake if you get it wrong, right?
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.340]   I mean, if you relax with the wrong--
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.900]   Just ask the Google baby.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.700]   Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of investment to it.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.940]   But China's obviously a really, really, really big market.
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.060]   I mean, they have, I think, more kids in school
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.860]   than we have people in the United States.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:12.020]   So the thing is that it's obviously a huge opportunity,
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:15.240]   but there's a lot of stuff you have
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.040]   to deal with language barriers, the government restrictions
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.360]   that are there, all the cultural differences.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.840]   But there is a big market that has proven itself
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.800]   willing to buy all kinds of stuff.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.120]   I mean, there's a thriving luxury market in China.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.720]   So it's not-- I don't think it's surprising.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.960]   I think that Apple just-- it probably
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.680]   took them a long time to kind of get to where they're finally
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.040]   really launching this full tilt.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.960]   But they're opening stores.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.160]   They're doing all the other stuff.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   It totally makes sense.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.720]   OK, I'm going to move on now if it's OK with you.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.840]   Apple Insider says the Google Voice app,
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.240]   reportedly approved by Apple.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.760]   The official one, we're not talking about GV--
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:58.700]   last week, we talked about a GV+ premium.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.120]   This is actually TechCrunch.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.280]   AOL's TechCrunch.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.800]   Is that-- could that possibly-- that story is yesterday?
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   It's a done deal.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.720]   It's done deal.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.160]   It happened.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.160]   Yeah, it happened.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.960]   Yeah, it happened.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.840]   Wow.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.520]   $25 or $40 million, depending on who you ask.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.600]   Wow.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.200]   I was sitting next to Pete Cashmore at the movies last night.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.000]   And I asked him about it.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.280]   He said, I hope it's true.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.800]   Did he give you these fashionable--
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.080]   He gave me interesting facts about the movie.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.640]   No, it's interesting.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.680]   By the way, I know everybody's raving.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.000]   David Denby and the New Yorkers said the social network
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.280]   is brilliant and something innovative.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.800]   I think it's the same words they used to talk about Apple.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.400]   But I was not-- I was underwhelmed a little bit by the movie.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.360]   I did not think it was that good.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.840]   And I also didn't think it was that nasty to Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.520]   I thought it was very-- have you seen it yet, Annie?
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.600]   I have not seen it yet.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.040]   But--
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   It's worth seeing.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.480]   The fact that "Sneran Sorkin" movie--
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.000]   I love it.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:52.960]   --pretty much means I have to see it.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:53.480]   I love it.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.120]   But I think if only for the eight minute single shot scene,
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.720]   which everybody's just talking with cameras picking up
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.560]   and losing conversations over the course of 10 minutes.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.080]   Yeah, that's how the show begins.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.720]   I mean, the movie begins is a--
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.360]   Of course.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:08.480]   Yeah, very difficult to follow conversation in a bar.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.760]   Very snappy dialogue.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.200]   But I think almost too choppy because the movie keeps cutting
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.760]   back and forth between depositions and the actual events,
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.800]   deposition, the actual event, deposition.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.640]   And I didn't like that very much.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.120]   And it may be that I'm too close.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.080]   And I know too much about the story.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.520]   And maybe that it's-- general audiences love it.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.800]   And I just know too much.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.960]   But what I was surprised is-- because everybody's saying,
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.480]   oh, poor Mark Zuckerberg, he's just going to-- this is just
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.960]   a smear piece.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.600]   And I don't think he came off that badly.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.720]   And he just comes off as a anti-social nerd,
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.280]   the kind of person we all know very well, which there are many,
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:43.800]   yes.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.680]   There's all things considered story about this the other day
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.680]   that I wish I had rewind on my radio,
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   because I'm pretty sure they said that Mark Zuckerberg is
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.480]   a private person.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.800]   Which is--
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.080]   I said that on Oprah.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.160]   Oprah, when he was talking to Oprah, he was like--
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:00.800]   He did say that.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.640]   And I know you're a very private person, Mark.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.000]   And I'm just like--
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.600]   Well, we should respect that.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.880]   I'm going to go see it this Friday,
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:15.440]   because as the nerd I am, it is my duty to see any movie that
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.840]   has lots of beautiful people typing in front of computers
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.520]   and saying words I might understand.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.680]   That's the chief problem.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.600]   I don't think this is a spoiler to say.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.760]   One of the most dramatic moments in the movie
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.800]   is when they make Facebook live, right?
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.200]   And by the way, if this weren't about Facebook,
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:36.880]   if this were about site zzz.com, I think it would be a snore.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.400]   I think it's only because of all the--
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.880]   You can't make typing look interesting.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.240]   They've tried every way.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:41.760]   So he flips--
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.480]   He flips letters on Keanu Reeves' face.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.920]   He flips the switch.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.760]   And because you know it's Facebook, it's like, oh,
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.400]   we're here at the moment Facebook began.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   And it's just kind of OK.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.000]   Donner was--
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.320]   So they need to have a murder plot to it.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.080]   So it's like anti-trust with what Tim Robbins?
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.600]   Exactly.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.200]   It was the evil Bill Gates dictator.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:01.920]   That was good.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.880]   Now that was a good movie.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.840]   That's infinitely watchable, my friends.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.320]   Infinitely.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:07.960]   So what do you think?
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.360]   Google Voice approved by Apple.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.760]   This is what AOL's tech consciousness.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.800]   I can't even say that was three things.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.240]   Well, it got approved.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.120]   I'm going to have to come up with another joke
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.600]   to keep recycling on Twitter because I can no longer ask
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.520]   if Apple is still reviewing and studying the Google Voice
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:24.800]   app.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.000]   So I'm happy to see it as a developer
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.360]   because that was always one of the things that I got
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.160]   frustrated with when I was kind of pondering.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.480]   If I wanted to be in the app store,
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.720]   was, well, are they going to reject my app
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.520]   because I'm the next Google Voice or what?
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.480]   Well, it proves that they've lessened those restrictions
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:41.960]   a lot lately.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.840]   It proves that Apple wasn't lying when it said,
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.360]   well, when we haven't rejected it, we're reviewing it.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.560]   Right.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.640]   A year later, it's just extra approving it.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.000]   That's how much we like it.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:53.680]   That was a--
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:53.960]   Well, you did.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.240]   If not, the Apple Institute have already
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:59.040]   read said that they approved the release,
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.200]   but now Google is going back and they're
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.360]   adding multitasking support and iOS for support.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.520]   So did they have the actual version from a year and a half
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.000]   ago still sitting at 24 of you for the past 18 months?
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.600]   And now it's like, oh, it was approved.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.400]   So let's go back and add all this new stuff now
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.400]   to catch up with everybody.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.840]   Very interesting.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.640]   The Manila folder fell behind the desk.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.600]   We're sorry.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.040]   Oh, we found that.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.920]   I'm trying to remember I had it back in the day.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.200]   And I have tried several of its successors, which
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.600]   have just been--
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.760]   Wow.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.200]   You never had the official Google.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.440]   That was never approved.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:34.840]   OK.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.280]   Well, I thought--
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.920]   There was GV+.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.280]   That might have been the last one.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.040]   I think it's one of them.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.040]   There's GV in the grid.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:42.880]   There's GV connect.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.880]   Right.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.560]   I mean, for me, the thing is, is that if it's really
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.960]   able to run in the background like Skype does, for instance,
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.000]   without any of my battery, the same way Skype does,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.680]   and it's able to attach to my Google voice number, to me,
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.520]   that's what I've been waiting for.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.600]   Because it's just been one of those things that I don't want
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.000]   to give people out a phone--
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   Right.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:04.640]   --my cell number.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.400]   I just want to give my Google voice number
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.560]   so that I can route it wherever I want to go.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.000]   I would say one of the chief selling points of Android phones
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.680]   is that it does have that tight integration in Google Voice.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.000]   Right.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.200]   Well, it's done.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:18.400]   I mean, the problem with phones is echoed throughout the problem
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.640]   of a lot of our communication tools, which
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.840]   is that there's always a trade-off between the immediacy
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.640]   of getting somebody the second it occurs to you
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.040]   that you want them versus the relative-- who knows?
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.480]   They could be in the middle of something right now.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.360]   It could be inconvenient.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.720]   And phones, even with answering machines, answering machines,
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:33.560]   just make it worse.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.240]   They just incurred debt for you.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.800]   And I think the biggest thing Google did--
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.120]   I guess I had something called Sunrock back in the day
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:40.840]   that did this.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:41.640]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.160]   What happened to that?
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.120]   That was a really nice service.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.400]   No, they went under and got acquired, and then people made it.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   You know, I'm really disappointed.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.360]   X-Markz is going out of business.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:48.840]   I know.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.400]   That sucks.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.360]   That's so sad.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:53.320]   Mitch Capers, company that synchronized Firefox bookmarks.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.520]   But what they did was they took that out of the equation.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.600]   If you want to answer it-- if you want to answer your Google
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.080]   phone like a phone, you can do that.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.880]   If you want to have your Google phone throw up a little bit
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.040]   of a speed bump, somebody's going to say who they are,
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.400]   you can do that.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.640]   Or if you just want to do not disturb and have everything
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:14.080]   be shunted off into this pile that you collect when you're ready.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.760]   Or for that matter, I think you can just filter based on groups.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.440]   There's just so much to it that's not simply fiddling.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.840]   It really is about saying, I want to manage how available I am.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.120]   And for me, that means a lot.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.080]   And for the people that I talk to you, that means a lot.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.960]   So I think it's much more than just like, oh, this is a cool
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.560]   VoIP thing.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.400]   Oh, I agree.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.520]   I think it's-- you know, I just can't imagine having a regular
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:34.840]   phone.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.280]   My sister a lot has a phone.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.040]   Every time we're there, she's like, I understand why you
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.280]   only have this blah, blah, blah.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.000]   It's like, no, I don't want to buy any sighting.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.640]   You know, it's like constant spam the entire time.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.560]   That's all she gets.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.440]   It is amazing, isn't it?
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.440]   I get so--
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.600]   I don't make you rub your face, Leo.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.560]   Did I make you--
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.520]   Oh, you just-- yeah, because I get Viagra people calling me.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.720]   Calling me on my phone.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.760]   They call me in the office.
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.480]   That's really-- that's low.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.840]   There's really two ways to handle phones.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.560]   It calls as far as I'm concerned.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.360]   There's what I tend to do if I'm working.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.440]   If I could call as soon as I know that they're a thing,
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.400]   I don't even say I have to go.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.640]   I just put the phone down.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.600]   I feel like they didn't show me any respect to call me.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.400]   So I don't have to show them any respect to say I have to go
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:13.600]   now.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.760]   I just put the phone back to work.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.600]   That's what I can do.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:17.120]   You're right.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:17.600]   That's--
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.280]   Well, no, because then they'll think you just
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.000]   actually got cut off.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:20.840]   They'll cut you back.
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.040]   But I'll give them one polite--
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.560]   I'll give you one polite.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.440]   I don't conduct-- I don't need such business like this
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.840]   over the phone, but they can be calling anyway.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:30.720]   And if they say thank you for your time,
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.680]   I say you're welcome.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.040]   Goodbye.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.400]   Now, if they're American--
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.080]   If they go any other page, it could tell.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:35.400]   Right.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.640]   If they're American, you can say put me on your do not call list.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:42.560]   And then they're legally bound to not ever call you again,
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.720]   or they can be prosecuted.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.400]   Not that works.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.440]   But the Viagra people are from China and India.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.280]   Remember that.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   And so they-- and in fact, I said to this guy,
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.680]   he called the office.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.560]   He said, oh, we'd like to talk to Leo
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.240]   LaPorte about his-- about Cialis.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.600]   He said about his Cialis purchase.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.800]   So I got on the phone with him.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.440]   I know.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.240]   I got on the phone with him.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.120]   I said, dudes, this is my work.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.640]   You are embarrassing me.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.560]   Demel.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.480]   That is weak.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.880]   What did you know?
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.280]   One thing that Google is currently not uniquely situated
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.680]   to do, but is better situated to do--
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.200]   is to be a conduit for making stuff that didn't
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.240]   used to be functional, functional, which again means
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:22.880]   a lot to me.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.600]   So for example, I tend to say, you ever
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.720]   have the thing where you just want
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.240]   to schedule a phone call with somebody,
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.280]   and you have to exchange like 35 emails about it,
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.160]   or you end up using something like Doodle--
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.520]   Doodle Let's CH.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.920]   My thing is, I just say to my friends,
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.440]   just send me a modifiable G-Cal invite.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.440]   You don't-- and send it to me.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.320]   I understand what it is.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.160]   I can either do it or I can.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.680]   I can respond if I need to.
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.280]   But why don't we start by making something functional
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.520]   before we start going like, how does it occur to me?
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.280]   So I'm just going to go take your time.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.120]   I think Google is in a position to do that.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.320]   Because who's to say that you couldn't do stuff,
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.040]   like read, filter against a subject line,
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.160]   and have that turn into a certain kind of thing?
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:58:59.600]   I don't know.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.200]   I mean, I think I'd love to see more of that.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:04.600]   I wish there was more Google voiceification of the world.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.360]   That's what I wish.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.000]   Well, it's interesting because at the time,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.360]   the thinking was that it was AT&T, not Apple,
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.960]   that kept Google Voice off the phone.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.560]   You can see why, because it really does
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:17.120]   disintermediate AT&T.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:21.040]   However, either AT&T gave up or Apple--
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:24.480]   our theory of the last few weeks is that, well, Apple
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.400]   is just starting to become sensitized by the DOJ, the EU,
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.400]   all these investigations, the FTC.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.240]   And they're saying, well, we better start
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.800]   approving some of this stuff.
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.800]   In fact, this might have worked.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.440]   The European Commission has dropped not one,
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.600]   but two antitrust investigations into Apple.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.560]   The one was on the restriction on what tools you could use
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:44.560]   to develop for iOS.
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.800]   Remember, a few weeks ago, Apple changed their tune
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.040]   on that one.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.680]   The other is not related, but forcing iPhone users in Europe
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.080]   to return to the country of purchase to get warranty
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   repairs.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.120]   You bought it in Poland.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.840]   You go to Poland.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.000]   Apple changed both policies, and the EU
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.120]   has dropped investigations.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.400]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.520]   I was deciding what battles you want to fight.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.440]   These aren't worth it for Apple.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.080]   I mean, there's plenty of other things to do.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.760]   And I think, finally, they got some sense of--
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.720]   Well, for people who say there's no government has no role,
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.440]   there's no point in government, this just shows you.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.840]   Maybe a little regulation ain't a bad thing.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.680]   After all.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.400]   Well, these were the most positive inroads Apple's made
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.760]   since they launched the App Store.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.280]   I mean, people were complaining about the tool set
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.040]   and apps being rejected, and all this stuff for the past--
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.000]   the App Store's been out, what, two years now.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.680]   And a lot of this stuff has been an issue since day one
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.360]   since it launched.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.720]   And it's refreshing to me to see all this stuff finally
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.000]   starting to change, because I'm a lot more comfortable now
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.800]   than I was six months ago with putting a big chunk of my business
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.000]   on the App Store, whereas six months ago--
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.480]   You like to see this--
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:55.960]   this sauce.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.760]   I mean, I'm never going to go and use Mono, which
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.160]   is the .NET tool set to build iPhone apps.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.880]   I'm never going to use Flash to build iPhone apps.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.920]   I'm always going to use Xcode, because that's what I know
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   I'm comfortable with.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.520]   But if a better tool comes along down the road that's not made
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.240]   by Apple, I'm comforted to know that I am going to have the option
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.560]   to use it if I want to.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.360]   Well, and it's just insulting to say what you can and can't use.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.240]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.240]   I think most people are going to-- are frustrated when they see
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.280]   that people are going to be--
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.080]   there's like-- they'll say, oh, well, someone's
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.520]   going to be using Flash, and the app's
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.640]   going to be substandard and subpar.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.960]   Well, if it's a subpar app, then no one's going to download it.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.360]   It's going to get poor reviews, and the developer's
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.240]   going to learn their lesson.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.680]   If you want to build a really high quality application
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.640]   on the App Store, I think at this point,
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.280]   you still do have to use Xcode and Objective-C.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.400]   But Apple has never taken the path, oh,
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.000]   we'll let the market decide on that one.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.640]   Oh, we'll allow some bad apps that the market will reject.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.640]   That's not Apple's way.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.360]   They're saying we want it only to be good apps in the store.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.840]   So if you buy into the Apple way,
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.200]   you have to allow them to do things like, say,
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.400]   you can't use Flash if it's substandard.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.040]   Well, I can't think of it as a user I just want to be informed.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.280]   I want to know that I'm buying--
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.960]   that I'm paying for something, because there's no way
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.120]   to really get returns.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.280]   So the issue that I have is someone who kind of will really
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.520]   buys lots of apps as I need them,
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.080]   is I get really frustrated when it turns out
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.640]   to be complete crap, and there's nothing I can do about it.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.680]   It's OK because it was $2.99 or $3.99.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.080]   But if that happened often, and that started causing sluggish
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.520]   in some of my phone, I might start buying a lot less apps
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.640]   system-wide.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.080]   And so all I want to know is that is it a native app,
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:28.920]   or it's not a native app?
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.520]   I just want to brand down there that just lets me know
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.240]   so that I can make that as part of my decision.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.560]   What I don't want is them all mixed in with everything else.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.080]   That's my issue.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.160]   Well, I think where you're going to see a lot of these--
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.480]   let's just use Flash as the example,
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.160]   where I think you're going to see a lot of these Flash
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.880]   applications is from big corporations.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.240]   So you're going to get-- let's say Conda-Nast, for example.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.720]   Conda-Nast is going to say, we want to bring magazine X to the iPad.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.240]   What's the best way we can do this?
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.120]   Well, InDesign has this Create InDesign to Flash tool.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.280]   Oh, we know what InDesign is.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.560]   We know what Flash is.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.240]   Let's build an app that way.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.600]   And so as soon as you launch this application,
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.320]   most likely you're going to be able to tell that it is a Flash application.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.480]   And most of the time, these big companies are giving these apps away for free.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.080]   So you're not really out-money on that.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.640]   I don't really think small developers like myself are the panics or the rogue amoebas of the world.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   I don't think they're ever going to be using tools like this.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:23.720]   I think it's for the big corporations who want to build something on one platform
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.520]   and then push it out everywhere.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.320]   Jason, I still had a tune about this the other day.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.560]   What was the app that just came out that only works in landscape mode?
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560]   Sports Illustrated.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.560]   Is that right?
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:40.440]   And well, he made an interesting point, which is apparently it's extremely costly to publish
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.920]   what amounts to, I guess, four versions of the site.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.880]   I can say something about that because I've been off and on developing a game.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.040]   And when I'm working with a developer, we're trying to figure out, okay, so how do we need
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.120]   the interface to change with the with goes this way instead of that way?
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.120]   Do we have the text moved?
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.800]   Do we have the characters move?
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.880]   And then after going back and forth by different modes, we said, or we could just simply
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.480]   lock it to portrait mode.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.160]   And then we went, yeah, let's do that because we just don't have the time to, I mean, you
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.560]   get one interface that really works great and you start thinking in those terms and then
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.200]   you wonder what added value can we add by letting this rotate and you're thinking, we're
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.200]   not adding any value.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   We're just letting it rotate.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.840]   So I don't have a problem with that.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.280]   I think that the issue is is that if you really want to have any kind of control over how
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.520]   it looks, I think you're going to have to decide one way or the other because yeah,
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.280]   it would be way too much work to try to do both as far as land.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:35.000]   But I read this article on how Wired had to do their first iPad app and, you know, because
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.640]   they were doing it through the Adobe pipeline and there was just this incredible mess of
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.520]   all these images that there were two sets of the of the magazine.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.520]   You're actually downloading.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.880]   That's why it's so big and everything's converted to some kind of, you know, it's just like
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.440]   it's a big mess because they're trying to deal with this rotation.
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.760]   If you try to have it do it dynamically, you'll get what you get with dynamic, which is the
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.560]   text won't flow what right the images won't be in the right place.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.080]   There'll be a lot of things that just aren't that don't have the fit and finish that magazines
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.080]   are kind of used to.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.160]   I think that's that's just in something because it's something I've wondered and you're an
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160]   iOS developer.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.280]   So you're a good person to add.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.640]   Are any of your apps available for iPad or are they just iPhone apps?
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.480]   Right now elements is out of the gate.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.480]   It was you.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.480]   That was an iPad app.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.480]   Right.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.800]   And Markdown Mail 2, which has been in review for about a week now.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.000]   It is a universal app that will run on both platforms.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.120]   So I'm a big fan of doing both apps as a universe lab.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.560]   I understand there's a lot of issues where my question exactly.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.000]   It's like building two apps at once.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.120]   So I released elements one one yesterday and about half the development time was spent
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.400]   on doing the iPhone version and then I get that looking great and working great.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:45.120]   And then I have to move on to building and making sure the iPad work version works.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.920]   So that was exactly my question because it just feels I thought it might not be so hard
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.680]   to make a universal app.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:57.240]   And boy, it sure seems like either they don't offer an iPad app for ages and ages.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.920]   Like it's driving me crazy.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.440]   I use the Sonos player and then I have to use the iPhone app on the iPad and would be
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.080]   such a beautiful iPad app.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.880]   And I know they're working on it.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.440]   Customers love universal apps, but they don't really understand that it is a lot more work
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.640]   to make a really great app that works on both platforms.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:14.640]   That's good to know.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:19.240]   And then the other issue, of course, is they've you bought the iOS phone version and then
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.680]   they want to charge you twice as much for an iPad version.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.880]   Justin, did you see that post?
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:29.240]   I don't know the dude's name, but the guy who recently had a post, the guy who was on
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.440]   worked at Microsoft and was on the office team at the time, Word 6 came out.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.760]   I don't know if you guys have seen this.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.000]   I'll try and find the link for you.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.840]   But it's a fascinating post because I'm one of those people that is like, man, Word 5.1,
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.280]   I think is one of the greatest apps ever made and Word 6.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280]   Wow.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.280]   I mean, you remember?
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.280]   You know, Word Perfect.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.520]   Word Perfect 5 was the best Word processor.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.800]   Most of the people say, "The first star is not fancy pants enough for you.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.560]   You should be focusing on the words."
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560]   I see, you know what I saw.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:58.200]   I've been saying that since the early '90s, that was the last one when I went downhill.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.080]   Word 5.1 and I don't remember what the Word Perfect version was.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:04.120]   I was so sad when they stopped making Word Perfect for the Mac.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.080]   That was the best Word processor ever on the Macintosh.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:11.600]   I just remember it's in Joel Spolsky's Best of Writing software book, which is a terrific
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.800]   book from a few years ago.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.960]   But anyway, I just recommend it, especially Justin.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.400]   You should check it out because this guy, it just makes such an interesting point about
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.320]   what we tried to do with 6 was to make Word more Mac-like.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.560]   What we really met with Mac-like was we make it more like 5.1, according to our users.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:31.360]   Really the thing, for everything I don't love about the guy, the thing Guy Kawasaki pulled
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.000]   off was he convinced a whole bunch of really skeptical people that doing more than a port
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.120]   was worthwhile.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.520]   In this instance, I think what you're doing is really smart to not bite off more than
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.440]   you can chew because just throw together some app and just add a little bar on the left
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.800]   just to say, "You know, use something like whatever.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.480]   I'm not a big gamer, but that the Angry Birds game."
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.960]   It's a different experience to use that.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.600]   That doesn't happen by accident.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.400]   Anyway, I'm ranting, but I think that's one thing that defines what makes a Mac a Mac.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.400]   I'll bet you Steve Jobs thinks that's what makes the iPhone a freaking iPhone.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.200]   We're not just going to let you go dump a big pile of mashed potatoes in here and call
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.560]   it an iPhone app.
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.800]   It needs to have the polish and fit and finish.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.800]   I don't know.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.800]   I think you're right, though.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.240]   I think users don't appreciate why that makes the Mac special personally.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.200]   By the way, it was WordPerfect 3.5.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.400]   That was the greatest version of, and you can still download it for free from the Corel
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.600]   site, but it won't run on any Intel Mac site.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.800]   I still have right now.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.800]   I love Word.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.800]   Awesome.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.800]   Right now is in the pocket for me.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.800]   I loved Word 3.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.120]   It was the first word I used, I think.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.880]   But right now, man, right now it's like Superdraw.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.840]   It was just or Canvas maybe.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.320]   It was like right in the pocket.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.720]   It wasn't Steve Jobs involved in the bread.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720]   Two things.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.440]   It wasn't Steve Jobs involved in the production of White Right Now to need to own the company
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.440]   or something.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.440]   Yes, I think so.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.440]   Was it Clares?
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   No.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.440]   But it wasn't Clares.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.440]   But it was like when those companies that happened to own it.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.440]   And the second thing is, I got to go.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.440]   Okay.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.440]   Do you want to do a quick audible pick before you go?
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440]   Sure.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.440]   I'm actually this.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.520]   I think I can start this off, and Merlin can pick it up for me.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.520]   Well, I do.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.680]   Because I wrote a column last week about some experiments I've been doing on my own workflow
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.960]   or my work habits intended to try to make sure that I remove any distractions and just
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.360]   focus on the work that I'm doing.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.280]   And a lot of it's being influenced by a lot of really great writing that's being done
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:31.720]   in the New York Times and elsewhere about how the tautatologic and short circuit are
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:36.960]   thinking process that we have these brains that were designed as cavemen to use distractions
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.640]   in a useful way, i.e. to be able to make a stone axe and focus on that for an hour, but
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.120]   still be aware of the fact that, oh, there's a growling sound coming from the bushes.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.320]   I should stop by doing right now and investigate that.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.160]   And part of the dialogue is that they're suggesting that if you have, for instance,
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.720]   your iPhone set so that always bings every time a new email comes in, essentially your
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.520]   caveman brain sees that as, oh, panther, let's take a look at that.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.360]   Oh, panther, let's take a look at that.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.720]   And so it's a really interesting, interesting field with a lot of great discussions going
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.720]   on.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.080]   If you want to, if you want to look up on the Sun times, that was published yesterday last
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:15.040]   week rather, and I liked a lot.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.240]   In addition to the New York Times pieces from a very good tech, tech rather, have not memorized
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.320]   the name of, I'm reading a book called The Shallows by Nicholas Carr, The Shallows, what
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.160]   the internet is doing to our brains.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.160]   It's a full scale book.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.400]   Nick is very interesting.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.160]   He's very anti internet.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   Exactly.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:38.720]   I'm not quite on his fence, but it talks about the neuroscience behind how the brain processes
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.160]   information, how it adapts to new things that we ask of it, and how we eat it even adapts
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.720]   when we ask it to do things that are stupid.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:54.280]   So for instance, he's talking about how not just the, not just the sort of anti tech opinion
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:01.000]   that I've lost, but I can't all this, all these technology things and the multi windows
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.040]   and they're distracting me and they're trying to make me do too many things at once.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.080]   But then he produces the neuroscience that says, here's the reason why the brain is just
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.600]   not good at doing multiple things at the same time.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.680]   That if you're trying to do three things over the course of the same three hours, you need
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.200]   to set it up in forms of tasks that you start and finish, then move on to the next thing
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.000]   that you start and finish the move on to the next thing.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.880]   The greatest message, I think, I've actually, of course, I'm reading this on a technology
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880]   device.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.120]   I'm not going to do my iPad and the Kindle app tells me I'm 44% through it.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.800]   So I haven't finished the whole thing.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:38.760]   But the really cool thing that runs through it, both the encouraging thing and the cautionary
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.680]   thing is that the brain is extremely plastic from your, you think that your brain gets
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.120]   hardwired in when you're 14 or 15 and you can't really learn new things.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.040]   No, the brain is always rewiring itself to do, react to whatever we ask of it.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.080]   So when we basically train it to do things that are not our best interest, it gets better
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.760]   and better at doing those bad things.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.440]   So if we're telling it, no, don't focus on this thing that you're supposed to write.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:05.320]   Focus on anything that will take you out of this job, especially if it's taking you out
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:09.280]   at a point where it's something that becomes a tricky part of the job.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:12.940]   And so that's why it becomes harder and harder to divert yourself from that behavior.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:16.120]   The good news is that the brain continues to be plastic throughout life so that if you
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:21.080]   sort of are aware of that you're in habits that are bad, you can easily sort of rewire
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.560]   your brain so that it's now just like water that goes through sandstone and starts carving
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.160]   new channels to find the path of least resistance.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.920]   You can sort of rewire your brain so that it makes it easier to do the things you ask
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.920]   of it.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.920]   So it's fascinating science, fascinating productivity.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.160]   I set up a, this is not necessarily tied to the specific book, but I experimented with
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.200]   four or five new mission rules for how I deal with my technology.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.440]   And really after about a month, it's not like I'm a tense guy to begin with, but at the
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.720]   end of each day, now I feel as though I've gotten much more done with much little effort.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.280]   I feel as though I'm really understanding the experiences that I'm having.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:02.320]   And first and foremost, I no longer consider boredom to be an enemy.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:06.840]   It is okay for me to be in line at the bank for two minutes and not check my email or
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.080]   not play a game because again, that's another part of the neuroscience that the brain needs
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:15.360]   some time with no agenda to simply process and integrate the experiences that you're
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   having.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:21.120]   So it's a really cool book and it very well might change the way that you work.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.760]   And now I turn the, I give the microphone to Merlin, who will be brilliant for the next
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.200]   20 minutes and I'm going to download it just to hear what he has to say.
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.920]   But until then, I got to be in Boston.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.920]   See you.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.360]   And in NACO, Chicago Sun-Times, take care of Andy.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.360]   Great recommendation.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.880]   You can get this book free at audible.com.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:39.880]   Actually, Audible is just such a great resource for people who want to learn about things
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.040]   like mindfulness, like getting things done.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.320]   It's just, there's tons of stuff there.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.240]   And of course, there's lots of fiction, history, biography.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.520]   I read all the time.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:56.120]   In fact, Audible saved my life because Audible was there when I had that two hour commute
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:02.360]   and it saved me from just driving off the road in frustration or road rage.
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:06.200]   And it also gives me a chance now to read.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:10.160]   We do have such busy lives these days, the ability to take some time and read to fill
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.680]   the brain a little bit is just wonderful.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.840]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.720]   Sign up for the gold account.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720]   That's a book a month.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.040]   You're going to want more in the long run.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.040]   Try it.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.040]   Try it.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.040]   Book a month.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040]   First month's free, first book's free.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.560]   You can cancel it anytime in the book's yours to keep forever.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.680]   So maybe this would be the one for you from Nicholas Carr, the shallows, what the internet
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.760]   is doing to our brain.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.200]   And we thank Audible so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.720]   Did you want to anything Merlin?
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.720]   I mean, I know you are--
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.720]   No, I know we're sort of--
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.720]   --taking to this.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.720]   You know me.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.720]   I'll go on forever about this stuff.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:46.720]   But I think he nailed.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.040]   I mean, there's so many angles to that.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.200]   I don't have much of a specific opinion about the book apart from what I've heard.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.760]   It strikes me based on what I've read about what he says that he has the problem a lot
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.360]   of nonfiction authors have, which is he gets the first half right and the second half left
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.920]   right, which is I mean, I don't think anybody's saying that we should sit down and just fill
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.080]   our head full of junk all day.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.080]   But I don't know.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.160]   So some of it's a little bit reductive.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.040]   My take on the whole landscape in a couple sentences is just that something I say a lot,
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.800]   which is that you're going to be distracted by everything until you know what you really
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   care about.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.120]   I know that sounds really hippy, but I really believe that.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.720]   And I think whether it's technology, I mean, like, do you need to set an alarm to remember
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.720]   to goof off?
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.720]   Let's hope not.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.640]   Also then, OK, well, then you're not really forgetful.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.680]   You're just not paying attention.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.800]   And I think that the problem is the thrust of my stupid GD book is that--
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.640]   Which will be out any day now, right?
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.640]   Exactly.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:42.200]   Basically, a lot of us are trying to solve the wrong problem on the wrong level for the
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.360]   wrong reasons.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.400]   And until we're aware of what problem we're really trying to solve at what level for
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.480]   what reason, it's hard to be good, whether you're an engineer or an artist or whatever.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.800]   And so I don't disagree with anything Andy said.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.840]   I thought actually I'd love to interview him about that because I thought it was interesting.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:57.520]   But anyway, I'll let you get back to it.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.000]   But I think that's a really important point.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.880]   People who are really care a lot about something don't get distracted.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.240]   But the people who get distracted are just not sure what to pay attention to.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.200]   I like the idea, though, just a little reminder.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.240]   And I think it's appropriate to have a reminder that sometimes it's good not to have something
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.960]   going on to let the ones think.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.200]   No, no, no, no, totally, totally, totally, totally.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.640]   The thing that I rail about and the thing that I get a lot of flack for is when people
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:23.520]   try to basically get a series of armatures and blinders to force them to care about something.
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.080]   And you know, the thing is, for example, I love Justin's app.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.400]   I love Jesse's new plain text app.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.360]   I love these apps that are very, as people like to say, minimal and non-distracting.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:40.240]   To me, the point when you turn a corner is when you say that you've got to have a non-distracting
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.840]   environment in order to write.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.840]   In which case, you're not really writing.
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.840]   Right.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.000]   It's like, you know, so anyway, I think that's complicated.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.840]   Anything you can do to remove the unnecessary craft, I think, is a great idea.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.880]   Well, Justin, I'm sure you love programming.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:59.800]   Do you need to do anything to get yourself to program?
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.840]   No, I do it because I like it.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.160]   That's why I have this job.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.480]   And I get a lot of requests every, not a lot, but I get quite a few requests from people
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.320]   that want me to add some sort of distraction-free functionality to elements.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.320]   It never ends.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.320]   It never ends.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.320]   There's always going to be one more thing.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.200]   Just need this one more thing and then I can write.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.920]   And I designed the app for myself because I, the premise of the app was basically that
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.440]   I have a weekly column that I've been writing in the Evansville Courier and Press for the
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.440]   past three years.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.800]   And I wanted to be able to write it on my iPad when I was out of town instead of having
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.440]   to bring my laptop with me.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.120]   So I built the app to do that.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:36.680]   And I never needed a distraction-free environment.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:40.960]   I need a text editor and I needed to sync back to my Dropbox account so that I could
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.360]   open my file back up and be be added on my Mac and finish writing as I was going.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.920]   And that's what I designed my app for.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.960]   You mentioned Jesse's app that came out today, Plain Text.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.400]   I'm really, it's, I kind of feel like I'm getting into the new era of Twitter apps on
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:00.280]   the iOS devices as in everyone's coming out with their own plain text, Dropbox-powered
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.280]   app.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.040]   But I think that's a good thing because I think the three that I've seen thus far is
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.880]   each one of us has a different take on what we're doing.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.560]   And I think that's good for consumers because my app has a specific direction.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560]   I want to take mine.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.600]   I think Jesse has a specific direction he want to take his and the other guy, I can't
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.800]   remember what his name is, but his app definitely has a different direction he wants to take
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.800]   his.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:26.560]   And so of the three that are out there now, if I can take a third of those and a third
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.280]   of those people think my app is great, wonderful.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.240]   And as you know, I have recommended this app.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.160]   It was a pick of the week on iPad today and I just love it.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.160]   This is Elements.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.600]   This revision too, Justin, the editions you made.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:40.920]   What's new in Elements?
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.560]   The new version came out yesterday, haven't you?
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.480]   You just type it right at the top there.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.880]   I thought that was cool.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.440]   So I pretty much took all the advice that I got from 1.0 and I added everything that
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.600]   everyone complained about.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.840]   So I added in the ability to delete files.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:59.120]   If I knew people were deleting as much as they are, I would have added that in 1.0.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.800]   I added the ability to rename files.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:06.000]   I changed the user interface because I was a fan of the old marble user interface style
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.440]   that it had before, but no one else on Earth was.
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.360]   So I changed that.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.880]   I added some speed improvements.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:18.040]   I can't remember everything else I added, but I got it to this point where I could get
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.440]   the email down a little bit and now I'm focusing on adding some other stuff.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:25.960]   The next release is going to be really focused on improving performance because I had a couple
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.880]   of people email me and say, "I'm trying to store 2,000 notes in your app and it's not
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.880]   working so well.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.440]   I'm trying to make it work."
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.240]   I'm trying to make it work a little bit better.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.880]   Afternoon, I'm about to become your next edge case.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880]   I love it.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.880]   Elements.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   It's on the iPhone and the iPad app.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.120]   How much does it cost?
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.960]   It is $4.99 and it's a universal app.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960]   Universal app.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.440]   So buy it and you got it.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.160]   Thank you for writing it, Justin.
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.960]   We talked about today a lot too.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.040]   Let us get to our picks of the week as long as we're talking picks.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.200]   Justin, I'll give you a moment while we go to Alex Lindsey.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.560]   We didn't get Andy's pick.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.660]   Alex, what's yours?
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:05.660]   I've got two.
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.660]   Okay, good.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:07.660]   You've got little little.
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:08.660]   Little, little, little, little, little.
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:09.880]   They're not that expensive.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.200]   I feel like I give everybody a break.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:18.080]   First one is an iPhone app and it's called Zen Brush.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:24.000]   I like playing with Kanji practicing and trying to do stuff like that with my finger
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.320]   or a brush or something like that and it just feels so much like a brush when you're doing
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.980]   it on your iPad or your iPhone.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:33.780]   In fact, if you hold your finger over it, it'll get thicker.
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:38.580]   If you go slower, it's, you know, whatever they did to figure out how to make your finger
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:41.940]   like a brush, they did it really, really well.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.460]   And it's just fun to do little brush strokes on it.
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.900]   And I don't know why, but it's fun.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.900]   If you want to practice trying to do stuff like that, it's a great little application.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.260]   I don't think it's very expensive.
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:56.780]   $2.99 for the other version.
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.780]   And here's the thing is it really works.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.420]   So if you look at this and go, "Oh, that's really cool."
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:00.500]   I don't really think that's going to work.
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.500]   It does.
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.860]   That's all I have to say.
[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:07.940]   The second one is, do you have a better file renamer?
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:09.820]   Is that what they call it?
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.820]   Awesome.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:11.820]   Awesome.
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:12.820]   Awesome.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.740]   So we shot, as I was talking, alluded to last week, we shot this thing with the Ask
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.540]   Aninja where we had all this stuff.
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:21.860]   We had, you know, we're doing this big contest where you can build a new open for Ask Aninja.
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:25.420]   And we shot all these red files and they're all in these, you know, red code, you know,
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:27.620]   and I had to convert that then to uncompressed.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.860]   And I ended up with this huge list of all this, this code and stuff.
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:32.820]   And I haven't had to rename files for a long time.
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.260]   That's usually someone else in the company doing it.
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:39.340]   And I was sitting there at home on Sunday just going, "Oh my gosh, I got to figure out
[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.340]   which one is the best one."
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:45.740]   So I started looking through and man, this is such a great renaming tool.
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.780]   If you ever have to deal with it, I just got to change a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.580]   Is this the one from public spaces?
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:51.580]   Is that the one you're talking about?
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:54.580]   And what's great is you can stack them.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:57.180]   So I'd say truncate it and then add something to the front.
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.420]   And then add something to the, like it was like, you know, you can do a whole bunch of
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.060]   different steps to the, to, and you get to see an instant preview of what it's going
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:05.700]   to do when it's done.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.220]   And then you run it and you get a warning, which is really good because I almost screwed
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.220]   up a whole bunch of files that way.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:12.860]   And you get a little warning and boom, you say rename them all and bam, it's gone.
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:13.940]   And 19 bucks.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:19.060]   It may seem steep to you to do a file renaming, but it is really, really well put together.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.500]   Really, you know, it just does such a great job and it's instant, of course.
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:23.740]   It's just renaming files.
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:27.420]   But it's a scary thing to rename files because if you really, you know, especially when you're
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:31.380]   dealing with hundreds of them, if you do something wrong, you know, getting back to,
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.980]   you know, you're doing something in a finder operation, you're not going to come back to
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:35.980]   that.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.340]   So having a good one is really, really useful.
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:41.740]   If you've ever sat there and had to rename stuff by hand, it's really not something you
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:42.740]   want to do.
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.340]   So anyway, those are, those are my two to great picks.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:48.220]   Merlin man, your pick of the week.
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:53.340]   I think in outlines, like a lot of nerds, and I've mentioned before how I like to,
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:58.580]   I'm, well, really markdown and OPML run a lot of my life, to be honest.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:02.940]   So much of what I do is in markdown or multi markdown to the point where now OPML and markdown
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:05.940]   via text files have become a little bit for me.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:06.940]   Really?
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:07.940]   So much of what I do.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:13.020]   And what's interesting is I always knew OPML as the thing you use to move your RSS feeds
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:14.020]   around.
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:19.620]   But it's amazing how much stuff you can do with things like mind maps or with outlining
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.820]   or whatever.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:26.780]   And so I have, I guess my pick in general is OPML and markdown now.
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:30.340]   The specific thing is, I hope I haven't mentioned this before, but carbon fin outliner.
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.660]   Have you, have we talked about that?
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:35.380]   This is an iPhone and iPad app.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:38.940]   And the address is carbonfin.com.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:43.780]   And I've played with, I mean, like I say, I really do think in outlines.
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:49.860]   I like mind maps for certain kinds of thinking, but I'm just a slightly more, I guess, what
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:53.580]   left brain person where an outliner really does make sense to me.
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.380]   And I got to tell you, on the iPhone, it's tough.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:59.700]   Because if you think about the gestures that you need in order to do something, there's
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:03.700]   only a couple apps that do, there's like one app that I think does outlining really well.
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:06.940]   There's one app that I think does mind maps really, really well.
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:11.540]   And so carbon fin outliner basically makes it very, I think very intuitive to just whip
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:14.420]   through creating an outline, editing an outline.
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.140]   It's slightly modal.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:20.140]   So there's sort of an entry mode and there's kind of an editing mode.
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.820]   But it becomes intuitive when you use it.
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:28.900]   And then what that does is, one of my two bones to pick with the app, which I've actually
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:35.300]   written to the very nice developer of the app, is I do wish it had full on Dropbox integration
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:39.660]   instead of, it's got some website, which is an app spot site that you can do syncing
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:43.620]   through, which is a little bit clunky, but I think you can also email and stuff.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:48.900]   But if you need to do outlining on an iPad or an iPhone, I just, the zep to liner is
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:49.900]   good.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:52.620]   There's a handful of them that I think are quite good.
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.580]   But to me, this is for now definitely the best one as far as I'm concerned.
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:58.420]   Do you have a mind mapping program you like Ken Kenshwin?
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.420]   Ah, so frickin' Lutely.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:00.420]   Do you want to know?
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:04.420]   I thoughts and I thoughts HD, no question.
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:09.700]   I thought, I was a pick-frode can we use one of these or the other of the, I mean.
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:11.780]   Here's the thing, you can use both.
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:13.380]   That's what OPML does.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:16.500]   So with I thoughts, the thing that makes, I thought, I thought so sexy, I can just have
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:21.540]   another second, is I thought, especially I thought it's HD on the iPad, it's a beautiful
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:23.380]   app for doing mind mapping, right?
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.380]   It's great.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:25.740]   You can use the screen, whatever.
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:31.540]   Couple additions ago, they added this brilliant hack where if, say you're typing inside of
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:37.060]   a box, space, space, space, if you hit space, space, space, it adds a daughter.
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.420]   Oh, that's clever.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:40.500]   You hit return, return, return, it adds a sibling.
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:41.500]   Oh, I love that.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.500]   Are you with me?
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:45.220]   All of a sudden, this becomes very powerful.
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.300]   And now you flip over to the little Justin, help me.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.300]   What's the do, dad?
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.060]   Where you go over to a thing and you get a list on the left.
[01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:55.180]   You do the thing with the thing beside the list view and the split view?
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:56.980]   The list view and the split view.
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:02.060]   You go and you basically hit a button and it syncs with box.net or Dropbox or whatever.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:05.100]   And basically, you just, I wish every, I did this.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:07.460]   You just hit a button and it all just syncs.
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:11.580]   Now what's neat is in I thoughts, you can also say, I'm sorry, this is deeply nerdy.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:16.500]   And I thought you can go in and also say, okay, whenever I do this, put it out as a
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:17.500]   dot.
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.140]   And look what you can choose from.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:24.220]   Image, free of mine, OKML, Nova mine, Xmine, mind manager, I, mind map, mind view.
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.220]   I mean, all of them.
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:29.380]   And it spits all of those into your box.net or Dropbox folder syncs all of those.
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:33.100]   And then you could be in any other app that deals with this is what people are not getting.
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:36.660]   The OPML means you take it anywhere and it just works.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:39.740]   So I can take an outline and put it into I thoughts.
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:42.020]   I can take I thoughts and put it into text made.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.620]   I can take text made and put it into multi mark.
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.180]   What happens to the formatting though?
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:50.620]   I mean, well, by and large, it's a pretty mature, I think it's a pretty mature standard.
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:55.620]   So there's going to be some kind of interpretation that makes sense, given what your intent was
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:57.260]   and what the application can do.
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:26:58.260]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:01.340]   And then the real sexy for me, I've mentioned this before is I'm a big fan of scrivener,
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:06.500]   a big fan of text made and Fletcher Penny, the guy who does multi markdown has written
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.420]   some fantastic scripts.
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:12.980]   These are written one, for example, that'll take just indented text in text made and turn
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:15.620]   it into an omniautliner outline.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.860]   You can output everything out of scrivener.
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:22.940]   What I'm trying to get out with all of this is between OPML and markdown, you now have
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:28.580]   some really powerful ways to round trip between some extremely sophisticated apps.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:33.180]   And increasingly as that stuff does get synced through something like Dropbox in just in
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:37.420]   this case, I think we're going to a really interesting place where it really is not about
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.540]   the tools anymore.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.780]   You're removing the friction and just making it really easy to do whatever you've got to
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:43.540]   do wherever you go.
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:48.940]   And then my secret side slide in recommendation is Justin's app, which is Markdown Mail, which
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:51.180]   is just I love to death.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.300]   It's a terrific app for basically taking Markdown, getting a live preview.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:58.740]   I can't believe this is not in every app already, but it makes it very easy to preview
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:03.220]   your Markdown and then either mail it to somebody or a lot of times what I do is just copy
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.220]   it straight out.
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.820]   You actually write your emails in Markdown.
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.700]   All right, everything is right right now, just to be honest, a simple note.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.740]   I write everything in simple note and then email it out of simple note.
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:14.740]   Okay.
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.660]   But I'm playing with different apps.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:20.620]   I'm looking, but you know, simple note works with notational velocity really well.
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:21.980]   And it's this is really nerdy.
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:22.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:23.980]   I'll shut up.
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:31.540]   But anyway, we did the simple note, notational velocity nexus, the axis of OPML on a previous
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.540]   show with you.
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:35.860]   I think those folks are going to have to watch what we'll have to watch off for though is
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:40.500]   is just that simple note is it's a kind of island.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:44.220]   It's a big island that functions very well, but it's still kind of an island prepared
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.220]   to drop.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:49.300]   It's kind of a problem in general with the iPad.
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.140]   Well, it's true.
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.860]   And I got to tell you, dude, every time I run into an app where they're like, did you
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:55.860]   see was a Paul?
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:59.980]   Yeah, I think Paul from Rogue and Meba had this great post one foot tsunami on his site
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:02.700]   about the VLC have you launched the VLC app?
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:04.700]   iPad.
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:08.540]   There's like a paragraph of text about how you have to go back to iTunes and do all
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:09.540]   this stuff.
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:11.700]   It's ridiculous, but that's how you have to do it.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:12.900]   That's going to seem funny soon.
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:16.060]   I think the whole like go to iTunes to move a document over.
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:17.060]   I hope so.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.980]   I mean, last night, I finally realized last night I've been trying to look for a way
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.420]   to do PDFs off the iPad.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:23.500]   And I finally realized last night I can do that out of pages.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.780]   It's the only app I found that does this.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:29.540]   But I really like that I annotate app.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:30.540]   It's a nice app.
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.780]   It's a little pricey, but that is a nice app.
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.220]   It is, but I use it a lot.
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:37.780]   And for client work and so have comments and markup and stuff like that.
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.780]   Anyway, I'm ranting on.
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:42.900]   But I think what I'm really ultimately recommending is that users and developers keep encouraging
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:47.940]   this same pattern, which is the open standards of these different kinds of formats and then
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:53.820]   ways to sync them, hopefully in ways that are not too hard on servers and the developers.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:57.020]   But I think it's really powerful because it gets you out of this hole, like, I use this
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:59.420]   app because blah, blah, and I'm locked into it.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:00.900]   You're not locked into anything anymore.
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.220]   It's with you everywhere.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:03.220]   It's on my phone.
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:07.140]   If I want to sit on a ledge while I'm waiting for a bus, I have 2000 text files that I can
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.140]   do whatever I want.
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.140]   There's no excuse not to write.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:11.060]   There's no excuse not to do what you got to do.
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:12.060]   It's all right there all the time.
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:15.340]   Do you carry your iPad with you everywhere or you do this on the iPhone?
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.220]   iPhone, I type faster on the iPhone.
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.220]   Interesting.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:19.220]   Yeah.
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:23.380]   I like the iPad, but I got one of those giant in case cases and it's fast.
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.380]   It's like a trifold.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.380]   But anyway, thank you, Merlin, man.
[01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:33.300]   And I'm going to turn your picks once again to reiterate Markdown mail from Justin.
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.860]   It's nice when you could check us in the mail, Marlon.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:36.860]   Nice when you're next.
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:37.860]   Thank you, my friend.
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.820]   Yeah, it's a yes.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:42.980]   And the outliner was called again.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.980]   Remind me.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.460]   Carbon fin outliner at carbon fin.com.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:49.340]   And for some reason the app store is being bulky about coming up for me, but I don't think
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:50.540]   it's terribly costly.
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:52.100]   Anybody want to yell out?
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:53.100]   I'm trying to find it.
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:54.100]   I think it's $4.99.
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:55.100]   Oh, for real.
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:56.100]   They know that's awesome.
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.100]   That's totally cheap.
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:58.900]   It is really cheap.
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:01.940]   I'll walk to the grocery store and write on this thing.
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.860]   It's just so fun to use and so easy.
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:10.980]   And then also just to underscore CF outliner.appspot.com, I believe is their sinking site spits out
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:13.100]   OPML spits out text.
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:17.780]   And if they add my feature request in the future, it'll also sink with Dropbox.
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:19.020]   Everything should sink with Dropbox.
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:21.340]   And I thought, you got to mention I thought it's an I thought HD.
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:23.460]   It really is.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:26.540]   There's a lot of really good mind mapping apps for these devices.
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:27.860]   It's really cool.
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:31.580]   But that's the one that's like it's got the most interoperability I think.
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.660]   And I find it easiest to use.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:34.660]   And then when you're done, go write something.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:35.660]   That's the important part.
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:37.180]   Yeah, it's nice to have the tools.
[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:38.980]   But if you don't do anything with them.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:39.980]   I delete them.
[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:40.980]   I delete them.
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.060]   If I'm at the point when I'm feeling too much, I delete them.
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:44.060]   Yeah.
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:45.060]   That's how's that for traction free writing?
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:49.420]   You can get so focused on tools and not on creating.
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:50.420]   Go make a cabinet.
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.420]   Come on guys.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:54.380]   Justin, your picks of the week, my friend.
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:55.380]   All right.
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:56.380]   I've got two for you today.
[01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.340]   I have a Mac pick and I have an iOS pick.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:02.780]   So for the Mac pick is you've probably recommended this before, but I'm a really big fan of Little
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:04.540]   Snapper from Real Mac software.
[01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:05.540]   Love it.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:09.740]   And Little Snapper is a really great application for storing screenshots.
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:13.140]   And as a developer, I download a ton of software.
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:19.220]   Like I I spend probably 100 bucks or more a month in the app store and then various pieces
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:20.420]   of Mac software I download.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:23.020]   And a lot of the times I'm downloading this stuff.
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:26.900]   Those are used, but a lot of times I'll see something in their screenshots and I want
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:31.500]   to be able to archive a bit of that and look at how they're doing UI and I save it all
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.660]   into Little Snappers.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:36.900]   So when I'm sitting here with my various notebooks and I'm sketching out things, I'll
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:41.580]   go into my Little Snapper archive, which has thousands of screenshots of iPad, Mac and
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:42.580]   iPhone apps.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:46.220]   And I'll just start looking at things as like, wow, what this guy did is a really good idea
[01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:50.500]   or what this guy did or a couple of months ago when I was working on today too, I was
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:53.420]   trying to think about how I wanted to redesign the registration screen.
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:59.660]   And so in Little Snapper, I have various different screenshots from various apps that
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.700]   are tagged as registration windows.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:06.060]   And I just went and I looked and I had I think 15 or 20 different apps that did it in different
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.060]   ways.
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:10.220]   And it's just a really great way for me to just jog my memory of different apps I've
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:13.860]   seen without having to go and re download them all again.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:16.860]   So Little Snapper, I think it's I think it's 30 bucks.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:21.620]   And then it also syncs with their imber service, which I think if you buy a subscription, that's
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.460]   free for a year and they have a free plan for that as well.
[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:28.340]   But for the most part, I'm just keeping all that stuff stored on my Mac just so that I
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:30.860]   can reference it whenever I'm doing my development work.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:33.100]   So if you're into that stuff, check that out.
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:36.700]   My iOS pick is a new app that's just come out that I've been beta testing for a while.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:41.300]   And this is a little bit of a selfish pick in that the developer is a Patrick Burleson
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:42.900]   of BitBq software.
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:44.940]   And he's a really great developer.
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:47.940]   He's a poor guy who has to do Windows development during the day.
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:50.340]   But believe it at that.
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:52.900]   But I've always wanted an app for Netflix.
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:53.900]   I'm a big Netflix guy.
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:54.900]   It just came out.
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:55.900]   I'm so excited about that.
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:57.580]   Oh, I just got an email about this.
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:01.940]   So I've been bugging Patrick and he's been listening to me complain for months and months
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:05.340]   about how I don't like any of the Netflix apps on the app store.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:09.380]   And I said, the only thing I ever want out of an app on the for dealing with Netflix is
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:13.340]   I want to be able to open it, search for the movie that someone just recommended to me
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:15.060]   and click add to my list.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:16.060]   Yep.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.060]   That's it.
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:20.460]   And Patrick went and he took the idea and he built that app and it's called Q up and
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.100]   it's two bucks in the store.
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:27.260]   And I've been testing it for a while and it's now my default Netflix app on my phone because
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:29.940]   when I'm on my phone, I don't need to rearrange my queue.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:34.180]   I don't need to see the top 100 recommendations for me.
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.820]   All I want to do is I want to just add movies that someone recommended to me right on the
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:38.820]   go.
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:41.180]   And this does a really great job of it without getting in my way.
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.820]   Well, the other thing to get back to what Merlin and Andy were talking about, the problem
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:48.020]   for me with Netflix is that I go up there and they say, if you like this, you'd like
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:50.220]   this and that's like another half an hour.
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:51.500]   And like 45 more movies.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:54.300]   I'm like, oh, catnip.
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:58.580]   I have to say, on the iPad, I use a Netflix app and it's really just a portal to the web
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.580]   pitch.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:00.580]   That's magic.
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:01.580]   That app is magic.
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:02.580]   But it's nice to have.
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:04.540]   I'll tell you to be able to watch those view now on the iPad.
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:05.780]   But I can't believe how fast it is.
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.780]   And you just hit it and you're watching 30 Rockin bed.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:10.260]   It's just it's so like the future to me.
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:12.260]   I'd like to hit that.
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:17.180]   Well, I was going to thank you, Justin, for your recommendations.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:21.980]   And I think we would be remiss if we did not mention second year software.com.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:22.980]   Justin's great apps.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:31.220]   We talked about elements, then also about today, which is a fantastic kind of to do
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:34.780]   list task manager, markdown mail.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:38.900]   And then there's one more that says check off, which is the little I need to do list.
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.140]   Little chick off.
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:41.140]   You know, we will.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.140]   There's the Russian.
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:44.980]   There we go.
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:49.220]   So I, you know, I have mixed feelings actually about my recommendation.
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:54.780]   While on the one hand, I was thrilled when yesterday the folks at Connie and asked finally
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:36:00.460]   said, yes, we're going to do an iPad app for the New Yorker, then a little disappointed
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:08.500]   to find out that even as a New Yorker subscriber, I have to pay $4.99 an issue each and every
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.500]   issue that comes out.
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.260]   But they have to be a subscriber.
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:15.300]   There's no deal.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.700]   But they're doing a nice job of it.
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:20.420]   This is this is the New Yorker app, which just came out.
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:24.820]   You get the you get the full app, a full magazine in a kind of a nice format.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.220]   If you want to read, you just scroll through it.
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:29.460]   It does have ads in it.
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:34.460]   The very much the same ads, I think, that were in the in the magazine itself.
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:36.540]   It's in it's in exactly the same typeface.
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:39.820]   You kind of really feel like you're reading the New Yorker.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:41.060]   There's another ad.
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.220]   The original ads or ads.
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:44.300]   It looks like it's same.
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:46.060]   It looks like it's the magazine converted.
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:47.060]   Okay.
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:48.940]   Well, that's that's that's that's okay.
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:55.260]   I was imagining that you a subscriber pay $4.95 plus we've added these eye ads.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.260]   Additional.
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.260]   Yeah, that doesn't seem to be I ads.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:58.300]   There are some nice features.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:04.860]   For instance, if you go if I go back to the homepage, it's a David Hockney cover this week
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:11.460]   and you can actually see a video, a little special feature out of David drawing the cover.
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:12.460]   So now that's awesome.
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:13.380]   That's totally nice.
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.820]   I mean, that that's a very nice value ad.
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:21.700]   It does, by the way, do landscape and portrait mode, which is also very nice animations for
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:22.700]   some of the cartoons.
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:25.060]   Look, I'm a fan of the New Yorker.
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:26.060]   I read it religiously.
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:27.140]   I am a subscriber.
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:31.260]   I get the paper edition, but my wife and daughter steal it every single time it comes.
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:35.140]   So, you know, I don't think I'll probably buy every issue since I'm going to have every
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:39.180]   issue at home, but the ability when I'm at the airport or whatever to buy an issue of
[01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:43.700]   the New Yorker for $4.99 and have it on the plane flight is a good thing.
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:45.580]   So I thought I'd mention it.
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:49.140]   I'm not thrilled that they aren't, you know, that they're not giving a deal.
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:51.380]   By the way, this is pretty cool.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:52.380]   Jason Schwartzman.
[01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:57.180]   Jason Schwartzman does the explanation of how to use the New Yorker.
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:59.060]   It's delightful location.
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:00.260]   I think that's on YouTube.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:02.260]   I've seen links on Twitter for it.
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:03.900]   Directed by Roman Copola.
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:05.420]   Yeah, is that amazing?
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:07.180]   Like the New Yorker wastes no.
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:11.820]   You're asking that Wes Anderson American Express commercial one, my all time favorite commercial.
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:12.820]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:13.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:15.980]   So can you actually work with the text in this?
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:16.980]   No, no, no, no.
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:17.980]   Every other magazine app.
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:18.980]   And you're the other one.
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:19.980]   It's really frustrating.
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:23.540]   At least was hoping for cut and paste so I could, you know, tweet like there's a great
[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:25.460]   article this week.
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:29.100]   I'm not sure I agree with it, but Malcolm Gladwell has an article about how Twitter
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:35.740]   is great for the status quo, but doesn't is not going to initiate any great change.
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:37.820]   Why the revolution will not be tweeted, he says.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:41.460]   And it's a stimulating article that I'm not sure I fully agree with.
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:45.260]   And I would was going to cut a little bit of it out and tweet it and say you should read
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:46.260]   it and I can't.
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:47.260]   You can't.
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:50.700]   Yeah, that's what is always frustrating me because there was, I, I subscribed to the
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:54.020]   Sports Illustrated and every now and then I'll download it onto my iPad.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:58.180]   And there's always going to be like a little passage that I want to reference on my Facebook
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:02.180]   or through Twitter and I can't because these sort of functionalities aren't built into
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.180]   these applications.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:07.340]   And I assume that's the old media thinking coming out in these apps.
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:09.260]   I wish it was a drawing though.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:12.100]   I mean, I, I, that's become such a muscle memory for me.
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:16.180]   Instapaper is in my fingers like command queue at this point.
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:20.500]   It's, it's, you know, and for me reader and reader, the combination of reader, instapaper
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:25.460]   and my text app, you know, I'm just flying between those and pay spot all day long, you
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:27.900]   know, and it's so funny when you hit something, you're like, wait a minute.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:28.900]   It didn't move.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.980]   It didn't grab anything and it's so retrograde.
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:35.260]   I do have to say that if you are a fan of the magazine, this is about as close as you're
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:36.740]   going to come to actually reading the magazine.
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:37.740]   They preserve the typeface.
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:38.860]   They preserve a lot of the feel.
[01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:43.780]   It's much better than the web version of the magazine, which is basically a PDF.
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:48.460]   I have mixed feelings about this, but I had to mention it because I know fans of the magazine
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:50.860]   as I am have been waiting for this for some time.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.980]   And yes, they could do it better.
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:54.820]   And yes, they could give subscribers, at least give us a deal.
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:56.820]   We already pay for the Dan magazine.
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.220]   But you know, it's pretty.
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:39:59.220]   It's nice to see this.
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:00.220]   And I love it.
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:03.420]   If you read, and there are some people I know who read the New Yorker just for the pictures.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:06.740]   If you are that kind of person, you can't actually click any cartoon and it'll go to
[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:10.420]   a slideshow of all the cartoons and then you're done.
[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:13.700]   So and you don't have to insert one of six DVDs.
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:14.700]   That's another.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.700]   Do you remember that?
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:16.700]   Yes.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:17.700]   Did you have that?
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:23.260]   I got that as an NPR premium and it was like, oh, so you like to read this whatever this
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:24.260]   Robert Schrucker for article.
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:29.260]   He's 17.
[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:30.540]   You know, you have a library out of here.
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:35.220]   I presume that space available, you can keep all of your old New Yorkers on here, which
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:36.220]   is true.
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:37.500]   When I see something this, I'm with you.
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:38.500]   I think it's beautiful.
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:42.060]   This or the new food thing, Andre worked on the gourmet deal or whatever.
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.060]   It's great.
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:44.060]   I'm glad.
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:45.060]   These are all beautiful.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.060]   These are beautiful.
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:47.700]   In this case, with the New Yorker one now, I always want to see something like this.
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:53.620]   I always want to ask myself, is this this obviously it's as good as they're going to do for
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:58.500]   now, but is this going to bring them new readers or is it going to sort of placate the ones
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.500]   they've already got?
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:03.500]   It's like the MPR problem with all respect to my friends who work there and the PBS problem
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:10.100]   is that they're still burning cycles on people who by necessity of existence are not going
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:12.180]   to be their fans in 30 years.
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:13.940]   CBS, the CBS problem.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:18.740]   It's like, how are you going to go and attract people who are going to click that once, discover
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:22.300]   that there's no cursor focal and we're going to close it, never open it again.
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:23.300]   Is that an edge case?
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:27.620]   It is today, but it may not be in a couple of years.
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:31.700]   I just always wonder, like, who do you think is doing that really well right now?
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:35.140]   Is there anybody that's really, really, really in front of this, not just on the way it looks,
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.140]   but in terms of how you can munch it?
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:39.100]   I mean, I think what Paul Ford did with Harper's was pretty, some of the stuff he's done with
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:40.100]   Harper's is great.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.100]   Popular science.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:44.140]   Once you pay for Harper's, it's all there.
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:45.140]   Did you play with it?
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.300]   Did you like the popular science?
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:50.820]   No, it was an example of beautiful, but completely opaque as far as UI goes.
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:52.540]   I was like so frustrated with it.
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.540]   Now when I see it on the, it looked like my hand hurts just when I see it on iTunes, I'm
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:57.860]   just like, "Ah, ah, ah, ah."
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:00.220]   I just, that makes me upset.
[01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:01.220]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.180]   Well, there you go.
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:04.580]   There you have it, a fabulous show.
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:06.140]   Once again, thank you so much, Alex Lindsay.
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:07.140]   I know you have to pack.
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:08.620]   He's headed off for parts unknown.
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:11.300]   Yeah, I got a couple things though.
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:16.740]   One is we got more seats for the iOS class if anyone's interested, go to big nerd.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:20.380]   It sold out like that day, the one I talked about it on Mac Breaks.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:22.780]   We got a bigger place that's near the office.
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:27.180]   So we've got a couple of five or six more seats, so it'll be, you know, but definitely
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:30.340]   go over and check that out at big nerd ranch.com.
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:37.660]   Also, if you are interested in playing around with really well shot and funny green screens,
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:39.820]   go up to dvgarage.com.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.220]   We have the shots of the ninja.
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:42.820]   So we shot all this stuff on a red.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.740]   I put it into Apple ProRes 4x4.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:48.420]   There's also an iMovie version that you can play with.
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:50.580]   It's just, you know, even if you just want to play with the place, you don't want to
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:52.300]   build an open, but you can try to build an open.
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:53.300]   There's the music there.
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:57.500]   There's instructions, but it's just the plates are so much fun to do.
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:01.020]   If you want to play around with key, and I put some tutorials up on how to do it, we
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:02.020]   released.
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:03.020]   Where is it?
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:04.020]   So on the dvgarage.com.
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:06.220]   Look at the bottom and click on the, there's, you'll see an ask.
[01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:07.220]   Ask a ninja.
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:08.220]   There it is.
[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:09.220]   Okay.
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:10.220]   So here's the section here.
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:14.020]   And what we did is we made ninja versions of conduit and dvmat Pro so you can download them.
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:17.140]   They're fully operational for the next week so that you can play with them.
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:21.580]   There's tutorials that I did on how to, you know, how to key the ninja.
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.380]   You get asking ninja, key the ninja.
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:26.380]   Yeah, key the ninja.
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:29.940]   So, so the idea is that you, even if you just want to learn a little bit about green
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:34.020]   screen, learn a little bit about how to do this stuff in a couple of different ways,
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:36.660]   even an iMovie, which I think a lot of people don't even know it does green screen.
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:40.100]   And so, yeah, iMovie does great green screen.
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:41.100]   What?
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:42.100]   Yeah.
[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:43.100]   So I have, there's a tutorial.
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:44.100]   You watch the tutorial.
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:45.100]   You'll see it.
[01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:46.100]   This is a, this is how to use conduit, which is our program.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:48.020]   Let me go back and watch the tutorial on this.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.780]   So you have a tutorial on them.
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:51.540]   On how to pull green screen in iMovie.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:52.540]   Oh, wow.
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:53.540]   Wow.
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.540]   And so, I just thought iMovie frustrated people.
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:56.540]   Yeah.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:44:00.860]   You know, it's, it actually has probably one of the best, easy keyers in the world.
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:04.500]   Oh, wait, I did, I used it once for that stupid, actually the stupid video you linked to a
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:08.260]   couple of weeks ago, I deliberately made the worst looking green screen matting.
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:10.620]   But it was all about my doing it right, Alex.
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:14.260]   If you've got a nice clean, color behind you, it does work.
[01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:17.620]   Well, I mean, it's, it's one of those things that you just, you have to turn on the advanced
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:18.620]   tool.
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:19.780]   That's like the key piece of it.
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:23.140]   Once you turn on that show advanced settings, you can simply drag it on.
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:24.140]   It's, do you want to make that?
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:26.740]   You know, it's one of the options is to make it a green screen.
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:28.420]   And yeah, the tutorial for iMovie was the shortest one.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:31.740]   It was like 45 seconds or something or a minute because it was like, okay, and then you add
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:34.260]   it and you say, I want a green screen and then it's done.
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:35.980]   You know, you go, here we go.
[01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:36.980]   Watch this.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:37.980]   Here's all the settings.
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:38.980]   Green screen.
[01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:41.980]   Green screen and he's on a red background, but he could be on Paris.
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.980]   It's, it's.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:43.980]   Okay.
[01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:44.980]   So, and a lot of people don't even know that exists.
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:46.860]   And so we, we had a lot of fun with it.
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:49.340]   We're having a lot of fun with it this week.
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:52.220]   And you can check out more there on dvgarage.com.
[01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:57.300]   It's just, you know, I could, it, the footage turned out so well, you know, it was kind
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:45:02.940]   of off the, off the cuff that Kent and I, you know, start schemed to bring the ninja in.
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:05.300]   And, and it, and the footage came out really, really well.
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:06.540]   Hopefully people will come and check it out.
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:10.020]   Even if you just want to play with some great green screen plates, it's just a great place
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.020]   to go.
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.020]   So check it out.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:16.020]   And if you want to go to dvgarage.com, Alex Lindsey is at the pixelcorpixacore.com to
[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:21.340]   join his guild of multimedia artists, pixelcore.tv for their many fine podcasts.
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:25.580]   Justin, we want to thank you so much for being here.
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:26.580]   Justin Williams.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:29.460]   Thank you for having me is at second gear software.com.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:34.320]   And any other things you'd like to plug besides those great programs today and second gear
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.620]   software.com.
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:41.460]   And if you want to help me fight the believers, you can follow me on Twitter at Twitter.com/Justin.
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:42.460]   Did you pay for that?
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:44.740]   Or were you just, were you there so early that you got just?
[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:48.020]   I, I've been there since July of 2006.
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.020]   So I got in there early.
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:50.020]   Oh, wow.
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:51.020]   You were really early.
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.020]   How did that happen?
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:53.020]   Really early.
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:55.220]   I just, I had a friend who got on and he's signed.
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:58.020]   That's almost before it was like public.
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:45:59.380]   And it was a great idea at the time.
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:03.500]   And then about a year and a half ago, this little teen boy from Canada came along and
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.980]   it's just been fun ever since.
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:11.060]   So actually if, if, if there's anyone out there in Macbreak Weekly land who is frustrated
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:15.020]   by their Twitter followers, I will mention I have a little side project I do.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:21.260]   So if you go to a carpei aqua.com/projects, I have a Safari extension called, I think
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:22.860]   it's called Twitter, filter Twitter.
[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:28.220]   And it's, let you input any keyword that you want to block and it'll hide it in your
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:29.820]   mentions in your Twitter timeline.
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:32.620]   So you go on expressions for people.
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:36.780]   So I, I set up one for the many different spellings of Bieber.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:42.060]   So when I go on Twitter.com now, I no longer see them in my, the many spellings of Bieber.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:43.060]   Yes.
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:46.980]   By the way, I didn't know this, but you do a podcast called IRQ conflict, which for
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:48.660]   Mac people will be completely opaque.
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:53.900]   But those of us who've ever used a PC will immediately go, oh, yeah, that is my, it's
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:56.020]   a little, little hobby I do.
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:47:00.540]   It's a 10 minute show, five topics about two minutes each between me, a Mac guy and my
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:04.340]   friend Michael Berger, who is a very good.net developer here in Indiana.
[01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:05.340]   Fantastic.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:08.180]   And I have the Mac perspective and the.net perspective.
[01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:09.180]   That's great.
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:10.180]   Justin's a really neat idea.
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.180]   Yeah.
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:13.260]   We'd love to have you back on the show, Justin.
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.260]   It was just really great to have you.
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:16.620]   And you've got a good microphone, which always is a plus.
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:17.620]   Thank you.
[01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:20.500]   I'll be, I'll be here is whenever you have me, have your people call my people.
