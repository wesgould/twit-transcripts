[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.060]   This week wow find him online it so weird oh my good online for a year. He's actually working. Oh wow boy and early
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.940]   Nice, maybe the world is starting to open again is a good sign. Yes, it is
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.680]   Also, uh, andi nakko from WGBH Boston. Hello, Andrew
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.360]   Hello, no, I don't I don't want to spoil anything that Alex and I'm supposed to talk about
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.440]   I do notice that this morning was the the queen speech oh, maybe he's like a Westminster and
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.680]   Fuck he's got a microphone on black rod
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:44.160]   You know remember the last time the queen did the covid talk she was wearing a green dress and I think perhaps they did in fact call Alex in
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.040]   to
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.560]   Said this time she's wearing a white dress. It looks like
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.560]   I thought it was interesting that even for like she this very very official sort of thing
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.320]   She still like carries her purse all the way to the house of lords. Yes. She's got it next to her on the throne famous for that
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.000]   We don't know what's in that that could be some nuclear codes or something in there. We don't know a
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.280]   Com a calm be super sure if I believe yes, and then and what and then of course I
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.640]   Wonder if she ever says to Boris Johnson the prime minister of Boris. Could you brush your hair for me darling?
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.520]   You just woke up. I
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.840]   Just hope that we never get the red speech like I've so much game of thrones anxiety about monarchs getting up to talk to people
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.360]   We don't need we don't need her to say all right half of you are gone and then snap her royal fingers
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.920]   Oh, wouldn't that be funny? Yeah, she's tough. She you know that they deserved it. Yeah
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.720]   So oh there she is. There's the dress. That's actually more of a gray, isn't it? Yeah, can you key you could key that out?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.240]   Well, no that that maybe Alex chose that dress because that way he could white balance and color balance off that
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.380]   The chair really they're used to people and big fur cloak sitting on it used to petite people and
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.040]   The chair that's wild. That's that's straight out of Valheim. That's awesome. That's awesome
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.160]   Father was a nine foot Viking and now she's sitting in his chair
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.880]   He just looks like a hobbit doesn't quite work a royal hobbit. You're in the Commonwealth, sir
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.240]   You should not be mocking your queen
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.720]   So the queen of Canada is a separate legal entity from the queen
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.080]   It was like she has 25 separate legal entities or something and our royal family is slightly different because we count a few Canadian cousins
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.520]   They do not and they count a few British cousins. We do not so
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.040]   We are distinct
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.360]   monarchy so so they're not all German is the point you're making
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.040]   Yeah, we have some that drink of the maple of the maple make a good maple tree the maple tree
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.600]   96% according to flurry
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.880]   96% of
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.460]   iOS 14.5 users have opted out of app tracking
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.880]   It's exactly as Facebook feared you all don't want to be tracked
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.720]   Yep, that's probably double what most people expected. However, it's a lot. I mean
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.640]   So it just shows given the choice
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.360]   When you get a new app on there as you probably know if you have 14 5 it says would you like to allow app X to track your activity
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.640]   across other companies apps and
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.280]   websites and
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.120]   Then there can be
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.240]   another screen at that point that you the company could put up saying hey, here's why you want to
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.800]   Allow tracking. Oh, they should have put we know who you're messaging
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.160]   Yes, yeah, and then we just blackmail us all into doing yeah
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.240]   Clearly people see that and just go no, please ask the app not to track
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.280]   Yeah, that's the difference between a system level of system level alert with
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:51.040]   Language that has been standardized by Apple and simply having a requirement. Hey, you have to put up something that asks for permission for this
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.480]   When it's a standardized thing with no written by people who have no
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.000]   Dog in this hunt say hey, we just want to let you know that this is a feature that lets you turn on or off tracking
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.680]   Here is one sentence then which that was provided by the developer to develop there to give their side of the story
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.240]   That's when people say, you know what? I'm not I'm not fooled by other descriptions
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.360]   This one says you know what I'm going to take the time to click on the deny button
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.080]   I don't care if there are features that are gonna that I'm gonna miss out on
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.440]   My fear was that this would be just one another one of those things that you see but then you just blow right past because it's you
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.880]   You want to see pictures of your cousins a new cat and this is stopping you from seeing pictures of your cousins new cat
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.800]   It's yeah, I mean
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.880]   Yeah, you would think that people just go okay, but it's not an okay or cancel
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.280]   It's a ask app not to track or allow and I think that that might have something to do with it
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:48.360]   App writing it out. You know, here's the example Apple gives allow pal about to track your activity across other companies apps and websites and then pal about provides the
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.800]   In smaller much smaller print your data will be used to deliver personalized ads to you
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.360]   Which is the excuse?
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.600]   I some people complained about this and said that they should be able to tailor it specifically to their use case
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.640]   But to me, that's like a red flag. It's like if a contact app said we're gonna help you find your friends
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.120]   That's not informing you of the potential that they're also sucking all your contacts to the cloud
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120]   Which a lot of them have done
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.280]   So I always think you've got to tell people the full positive the full scope of what that entitlement and permission allows
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.600]   So they can make an informed decision
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.000]   You can't just tell them like the best case scenario if nobody ever abuses the full scope of that privilege
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.400]   I've all right. I'm gonna be this is probably not a popular opinion here, but I'm gonna say it anyway
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.120]   Of course when you put it that way allow
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:41.480]   PayPal to track to track your activity across other companies apps and websites people would say yeah, I don't want that
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.120]   but
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.600]   Is it a little slanted? I mean I
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.660]   Mean doesn't I guess there's really no you can't there's no
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.520]   Education I just feel like it maybe if people had more information about it
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.200]   They would not necessarily be clicking 96% of the time to
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.720]   Disill how the offer was better like if they offer you five bucks for every website you went to yeah
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.700]   But I mean I don't know if people are full if that's informed consent. I guess is what I'm saying is it?
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.480]   It's yeah, it's it's hard to be completely informed for instance
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.280]   Google and all and a lot of its privacy disclosures that they have to make what they have to provide or excuse me
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.840]   what they choose to provide is kind of scary because
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.240]   For now they are being they're playing it safe with Apple by saying well by virtue the
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.080]   Google photos does not necessarily take all of this data and did and does anything with it
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:40.400]   But you have to be logged into your Google account to use Google photos and by virtue of that being logged into your Google account means that this
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.040]   Sort of stuff can be disclosed so there's gonna be some more granularity
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.760]   Maybe that once we once the developers figure out here is what Apple is going to punish here is what Apple is not going to punish
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.240]   I would love to I would love it if if the system became detailed enough that
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.440]   Users would feel comfortable simply saying well no, of course
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.200]   I don't want to be tracked
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.960]   This is not it
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.240]   This is not a follow me around and give me directions app
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.120]   So I don't want to be tracked
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.640]   But every time that the app can't do something because of what that how that's been set
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:17.520]   It can say again a stance some sort of a standardized alert saying this this app can't this app was not able to pull up
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.640]   You're the coupons that you saved at this vendor because it was unable to
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.080]   Maintain your identity in this store if you don't want that here's how to fix that or here's how to go back on that
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.560]   Well or what if you know, I mean in some cases it's
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.000]   Look we're a free service and
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.800]   The tracking we use is so advertisers will buy ads to support this service if we don't do this
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.760]   We won't survive might be a
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.720]   Instagram did that to me I went to Instagram and it said like you have to allow this for Instagram to stay free
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.240]   But my my I would I would have done
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.400]   Do you think for Instagram to say that is that hyperbole or is that fair?
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:04.720]   Well, no, but so I think smarter would have been for them to stop tracking momentarily and serve you the absolute worst most like
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.680]   Reminent ads possible the ones that you get that you know that you've exhausted the supply on any web page
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:15.720]   Like the ones look like pimples and like all the worst ads and then then turn the tracking on so you get the pop up and say
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.440]   Look apples forcing us to give you like the lowest common denominator ads if you'd like much better ads
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   Just hit this button. I'll give you the
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.320]   Actually though the consequence I think I have been told by people that
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:33.160]   Advertisers just won't buy ads on that platform if they don't have information about who those ads are hitting
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.200]   They still have it
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:40.320]   It's just the conjoining of that information with the specificity of the web like Facebook still has near perfect knowledge of everybody using their system
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.680]   They were they were doing things like buying the credit cards and making side deals on their websites to get specific
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.440]   knowledge for those domains, but
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.440]   I
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:58.760]   That's the other side of it is that maybe Apple's giving you false hope that if you block it you think oh good
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.240]   I'm not tracked anymore and absolutely you're tracked you're right you make it excellent
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.480]   They own the biggest properties on the web like they're tracking us through YouTube and Gmail and Google search and through Instagram and messenger and face
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.680]   So this might not be so they have near perfect knowledge
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:16.760]   This might not be so different than the cookie announcement you see on every website you visit now might be making you feel good button
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.840]   Yeah, well the only difference the huge difference Google has is they own chrome and they can do whatever they want in chrome and nobody can stop
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:28.920]   Well Google has a lot of first-party information because if you use Google to search they know every search you made and it doesn't
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.240]   They use Google's browser. They know everything you do that browser, but like
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:40.800]   Regardless and same with Facebook Facebook. You're giving Facebook. It's funny because a lot of people who are saying don't allow are probably giving Facebook
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.400]   Every bit of information that Facebook ever wanted one gap and people's privacy information is knowing that oh well
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.800]   I don't even have a Facebook account, so I'm safe that well, but you're visiting lots and lots of sites that have Facebook trackers on them
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.240]   so
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.920]   You're all even if so you're vulnerable to their ad network
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.040]   In other ways
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.360]   One of the most famous things that people the way I'm learning not to scare people when I talked to them about this
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.240]   But people say oh well the microphone on my mic the Facebook or this after network must be listening into my microphone
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.680]   I had a private conversation with a friend of mine yesterday about this thing and I got an ad for the next day
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:22.800]   And they don't realize that well probably because probably because either a like maybe you googled for that afterwards
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.720]   Or even just the fact that it knew that you're in the room with somebody who's a kombucha tea fanatic and that they probably
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.960]   Being being a kombucha tea fanatic probably talked to you the ear off about it for 25 minutes
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.480]   And that maybe now you're interested in more ads about kombucha tea
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.120]   So it's you're right in that you can't desensitize people to thinking
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.320]   Oh, I'll have to do is flip the switch
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.440]   All I have to do is install this ad blocker and I'm safe from tracking
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.360]   However, it's a simple thing
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.760]   This is going to be the thing where we take small steps to get to the destination and every if there's something that
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:00.320]   manufacturer like Apple can do to increase the security and increase the privacy on their device
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:07.480]   Why at why not do it? It's not complicated. Why not just do it? Well, I can give you a couple of reasons one because it doesn't do anything
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.680]   And two because it actually might do something
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.160]   on some some people may lose the ability to monetize I mean, I'm
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.760]   Constantly told we aren't gonna buy ads unless we can track
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   I mean I hear that and the more advertisers get that information the more they're gonna demand that information
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:32.040]   I'm afraid so it might have be might simultaneously be the worst of both worlds that you think you're stopping Facebook
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:40.400]   Google from tracking you and you're not and you're demonetizing maybe a redditor a site that you like that can't advertise without that information
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.160]   Quest is also a bit ridiculous because like they don't need to track like and I know the kind of sponsors
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.120]   You're talking about and they don't need to track what they need to do is share conversion data with us
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.880]   I understand that you can see how effective I understand that Renee, but you yeah, I you know
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:01.480]   Go ahead try talking to those advertisers and agencies and say hey you don't need to do this and they say well
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:08.640]   We do and we're gonna and if you don't do it. We're not gonna buy ads and that's that the conversations over you can't persuade them
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.400]   Well, is that a very valuable perspective? Yeah, I'm just telling you
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.280]   I'll all I'm saying is that we've we've we're now in a situation where these ad emberks are completely unregulated
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:25.880]   Almost completely unrestricted and that's not working out wealth consumers
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.760]   So it's appropriate at this time for there to be some sort of a pushback so that the ad the ad industry can either a
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.600]   Determine that hey actually, you know what we can work within this framework
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:43.000]   They wouldn't be they there they've never been encouraged to work within this sort of privacy framework because they never had to step step one
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.440]   After this is not the collapse of right at the collapse of sponsored content
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.960]   It really is let's see how this this industry can react to no longer having that kind of unrestricted access
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   And then if there are problems that are unsolved then we can go and address them
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.920]   But like I said, there have been so few advocates right now for user privacy. No, it's quite the
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:11.600]   Definitely quite the opposite. It swung completely the other way Andy that and this 96% proves it that everybody says
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:18.160]   I don't want tracking without cons without thinking about what the consequences will be and by the way Facebook Google and
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.080]   Renee YouTube they don't they're all first part a first person ads. Yeah
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.760]   That's they're all getting all the information right those big platforms are gonna survive
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.920]   It doesn't matter what Apple does. It's the little guy platform logs. It's I'm more it's people like that
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.800]   They're gonna struggle and podcasts why they're platforming. It's why it's why like Apple wants you in the Apple podcast app
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.740]   It's why it's so stupefying to me that puts me as an independent
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:50.200]   Podcaster on the outs because I have to join with Spotify I heart or Apple or screw me
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.960]   I'm not gonna get the ad buys but if you look at the moves in technology like Google very quickly they made their own browser
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.440]   They made their own podcaster. They're making all of the infrastructure so that they have total control over it
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:06.680]   So it's all first person's it's yeah, it's book isn't it's so interesting to me that Facebook isn't like they failed three times at making a phone
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:13.400]   Now like Amazon made the silk browser Facebook that had none of their browser projects were ever released their maps project was never released
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.520]   They basically
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.680]   ownership don't kill kid yourself Renee Facebook gets all the information they want
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:27.120]   Advertisers are very happy advertising on Facebook. It's very efficient. This will not hurt them
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.400]   It's it's they don't have the platform control unless you're on one of their web property is like they still have to deal with Apple
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:39.040]   They still have to deal with Google. They still have to deal with the whole thing. We were worried that Facebook would not survive mobile
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.840]   Remember they had no mobile strategy at all and I guess we were wrong
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.440]   Facebook has survived mobile
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.840]   But they don't have the power Google has like they could have very easily like I think of Mark Zuckerberg had more of a sense of commitment
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:57.040]   He could have very easily had the same infrastructure that Google enjoys at this point if you were conspiracy minded. I think
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:05.720]   One possible. I'm not sure this is what's happening one possible is that really this is the big tech companies and I'm gonna include Apple in this
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:13.880]   Saying pulling up the ladder after them, you know Apple just hired a major Facebook advertising exec
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.320]   Yeah for its ads platform. What ads platform you might ask
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:24.120]   Yeah, well, I don't think Apple should be in the ad business like at all like I think it's bad, but they are money
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.560]   I think Apple should want but they're their ad product
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:32.360]   It's it's ads inside the app store and ads inside news plus and other native iOS and Mac OS apps
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.600]   It says here so yeah
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.680]   It's it's not a good product and I don't think it's a business
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.880]   They should be in because it hurts their credibility on every other issue
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.440]   Yeah, I mean Apple doesn't break out how much it makes from advertising and its services revenue
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.760]   So we don't know it was fine with I add so I don't I don't buy the argument that this is like a new Apple thing
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:59.800]   It's just I think it's always been a dumb a dumb strategic move for them. Yeah, I say being CEO of an equally large company
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:06.120]   If I if I were conspiracy minded I would just say hey and I mean I think that's what
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.760]   Google has done with flock and
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.080]   Killing third-party cookies and just pulling the ladder up behind them saying we got what we got all the information
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.600]   We need
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.400]   The heck with the rest of you you have perfect knowledge. Yeah, so they don't care and I
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:26.520]   Don't know I just I wore maybe I'm silly to worry. I see what I see what the impact it has on our business
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.840]   very directly and you know and
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:37.600]   One of the reasons we started Club Twitter is because I don't think advertising is gonna work an independent podcast for more than the next couple of years after that
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.840]   It's all going to Spotify Apple Facebook all the companies that know that have perfect knowledge in your words
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.440]   Renee which is what Spotify is doing their building out their platform with all the acquisitions. They've been making as well, right?
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:55.320]   So an independent podcast will be much like an independent blog these days, which is a hobby and
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:02.200]   You know or or if you know if this kind of you get banned on all the social networks
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   Yeah, or if this kind of
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.880]   You know sovereign writer notion takes takes hold in that's why we're doing the club to it
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:17.680]   Hopefully people will support the shows that they like and you can exist as a as a entity without advertising
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.760]   I don't think we could exist at the level we we exist right now that way, but who knows we'll see
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   Depends how many people join club to it hit hit
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:32.360]   Wait wait for Leo's newsletter. Yeah, I mean if I started sub stack you know
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:38.680]   It's all over me quit stack. It's your own platform. You got own it's good. Well, we have it
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.440]   We do have a newsletter. I you know I just I
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.440]   Understand people don't want to be tracked believe me. I use Firefox with Facebook
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.640]   You know sandbox is Facebook like buttons and stuff so nobody the Facebook doesn't get any information
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.240]   There's no I don't have a Facebook account. So there's no, you know, it would have to be a shadow dossier
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.680]   But I don't want to add to their shadow dossier of me
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.720]   You know when I can I use a VPN when I do Google searches things like that, but
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:10.160]   It's hard to protect yourself your privacy especially from first parties and that's the real issue
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.960]   I think here's the first parties are gonna need all the information they want
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.760]   As long as you own the platform
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.520]   You know YouTube is never gonna have to worry about tracking
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:26.960]   Yeah, it's so funny because there are people I hear from people who were mad that we had to put some trackers in our
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.600]   Redirects and they said I'm just gonna watch it on YouTube and it was like
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.520]   Okay, oh wow oh
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:41.040]   And you could see because like if you look at SEO on Google versus SEO on YouTube like SEO on Google to me the difference between
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:47.560]   Success and failure of your blog SEO on YouTube means nothing because like all it matters is your video being good
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.240]   Cuz they have perfect knowledge of how long the person watches for what they watch where they stop
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.520]   about your tags and your titles I don't know if this was
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.160]   Facebook says this was a
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.720]   publicity stunt I think it was real signal
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:08.880]   But these ads on Instagram, you know you got this ad because you're a newlywed Pilates instructor and your cartoon crazy
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.640]   This ad used to be your location used your location to see you're in La Jolla
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.760]   You're into parenting blogs and thinking about
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.120]   LG BQ adoption and you know there were a lot more of these Facebook not only didn't take the buy
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.240]   But but according to signal and they do have a screenshot
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.560]   Disabled they're adding to tire like no, not only you're not
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.880]   About to say yeah never saw those ads and and by the way if you saw me you would have seen one
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.600]   You know you would have it would have been a small buy because it would be a small group of
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.720]   People Facebook says it was just a publicity stunt. They never bought the ads and we never canceled their
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.320]   Their account and well done there's signals agrees look at what they were trying to get publicity for yes
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.900]   Of course it was a publicity stunt. Okay. Yeah
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.400]   Yeah, and if you signal and you're competing against Facebook Messenger
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.040]   That's a message you'd like to get out is that you know Facebook knows everything has perfect knowledge
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.400]   Between this and the celebrate hack they've been doing a lot of good work on behalf of privacy
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.440]   Yes for individuals. Yeah, Moxie Molly Marlon Spike got a a celebrate device. We actually didn't talk about that
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.600]   He said fell off a truck
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   Gosh, he's walking around the road and gosh
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.160]   He just bounced off a truck and landed at his feet and found that it was very
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:28.520]   Insecure that it would be easy to exploit vulnerabilities in the celebrate. Yeah, it's it's a hard
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:36.120]   It was a horrible story because it it showed that the data that is on that is collected or is put on to that celebrate device
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:43.280]   Can't be trusted because the software itself is vulnerable to modification that you could even just put a file on a phone
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.200]   That's being scanned if someone put preemptively put a file on a phone that's going to be scanned
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.520]   Suddenly that machine that was being used with celebrate is now infected and can be ordered to do whatever they want again including
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.680]   Delete information make create new information already one trial lawyer who's
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.240]   whose client got
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.120]   Was sentenced to jail based on evidence that was collected through celebrate is asking for a new trial based on this evidence that hey
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.800]   Look, we didn't they didn't demonstrate that the celebrate device that they used was not
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:20.120]   Hacked was not it was not manipulated in any way. This is a device sold by an Israeli company used by law enforcement and border patrol and others
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:27.040]   To snarf all the data off of your smartphone and then analyze it and figure out, you know
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:33.080]   Whatever this is they're trying to figure out look at the I this is the this is the moxie's celebrate and look at the dongles
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:41.140]   The guy yeah, I come with this thing. This is ready for anything. I just want the dongle case forget to celebrate
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:48.100]   Give me the dongle. It is it is incredibly it shows off a much bigger problem to that
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:53.900]   The technology based on identifying fingerprints the technology that is based on
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:59.780]   Analyzing DNA evidence is public and can be scrutinized by people who are having that evidence used against them
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.100]   We have but celebrate is this black box
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:07.700]   Then there's there is no way for as far as I was able to tell afterwards after this story broke
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.820]   I tried to learn as much as I could about celebrate which is very very little
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:18.860]   How do you know that the data that was being pulled off of this device absolutely correlates to this particular suspect is everything absolutely trustworthy?
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.860]   Yeah, in fact, yeah, I would imagine
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:27.380]   This blog post will be entered as evidence in many a case where the celebrate data is the evidence against the defendant
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.020]   Here's the here's the quote from moxie for example by including especially formatted
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.020]   But otherwise innocuous innocuous file in an app on a device
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.780]   In other words your phone that is then a scan by celebrate. It's possible to execute code
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:49.900]   That modifies not just the celebrate report being created in that scan but also all previous and future
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:58.700]   Generated celebrate reports from all previously scanned devices and all future scanned devices in any arbitrary way with no detectable
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:05.380]   Time stamp changes or check some failures your honor. I asked the motion to to
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.100]   What is it? How do you say dismiss dismiss?
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.540]   All charges I might have order you're out of order this whole cell
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:21.420]   Yeah, and it's and it's insane because I think most of the vulnerability is based on a version of a think FF M
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:28.060]   M peg that that was identified in 2010 and been patched like almost immediately but no the makers of celebrate
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:32.860]   We're saying no, we'll just we'll just use the old old code. It'll work just fine for us. Nobody has access to our device
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.900]   Why should we worry? Yeah, exactly except every every phone that you suck
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:43.980]   Yeah, I think this is why the FTC in the next five years or so there's going to be some sort of
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:51.500]   the FTC already like made a statement like a sort of a proactive statement saying that by the way if you think that if you
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.500]   If you are a manufacturer of technology
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:59.980]   Hardware software and you think that just because Congress is deciding on new laws to pass through your industry
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:05.100]   Don't think that means that the FTC does not have power to put the hammer down on you because our
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:10.420]   Traditional role is to say that if you are if you're if you are manufacturing and selling something that makes a promise
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:16.380]   You have to make sure that your that your product actually withholds that advertise promise and that includes software
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:24.180]   That promises to be secure or promises to have no cultural cultural biases against any one group all this sort of stuff
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:30.020]   So I would love to see that kind of extended a little further saying that look you have you don't just get to say
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.940]   shrug and oh gosh what a what a what a whipsy we did
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:38.100]   Why don't we just give us have our CEO give a fluffy interview to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times even though he
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.100]   Know he or she almost never does that
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:40.820]   Guess what?
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:44.340]   They're now going to be consequences and now just like if you release tainted food
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:50.980]   Into the food supply you are going to have to show exactly where this code came from how it was developed what measures
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.980]   How this problem happened and what measures you're going to take right now to make sure this doesn't happen again
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.980]   And without that you're going to have to suffer penalties
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:06.020]   Yeah, I'm a little disappointed. I thought somebody might mention my my lovely shirt. I was gonna say you're very summery today
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:11.540]   It's uh, it's on tuck it. You heard on tuck it everybody's heard on tuck it
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.420]   This is our sponsor for the segment of the show is on
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:20.340]   Tuck it. I love this shirt. The thing I love about this shirt is I have already worn. I mean, I don't I
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:25.300]   I'm clean. I'm a clean person, but I have already worn this shirt many times
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:31.120]   But I was testing the wrinkle-free aspects of it. I've never ironed it. I think it looks great
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:40.660]   Untuck it shirts are designed to bring us back to the world. We used to live in remember that where you'd go people places see people
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:48.500]   I've gone out dancing in this shirt. It's exactly the the clothing you need to transition back to life as we know
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.900]   It's things like just the phrase gets me excited dinner with friends
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.420]   Uniting with family
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:03.860]   And especially vacations I ordered a bunch of untuckets for our upcoming vacation untuck it makes sure it's designed to be worn
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.500]   Untucked the way you wear shirts
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.220]   They they design on tuck it because
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:15.220]   The untucked shirt is a tough style to get right see that illustration where you you see the shirt with the big shirt tails
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.020]   And it goes way too low on tuck it has just the right length
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:22.820]   Uh, it fits all shapes and sizes and you look sharp even when you're at your most
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.700]   Casual by the way, these are performance shirts some of them not all of them. I have the performance shirts
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.740]   They wick sweat. They're great short sleeve button downs available polos made to beat the hito is wearing it
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.940]   The other day was a 91 degrees in pedaluma loved it

[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.180]   Every batch of fabric is tested
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.580]   To ensure the highest possible quality and consistency
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.700]   So they all fit and look perfect buttons downs polos teas and lees

[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.700]   First time they've been on the show and it's great to have you it
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.940]   Um, maybe you've noticed but I've been looking extra sharp in the last few weeks
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:23.220]   We are learning more and more about apple. Thanks to the apple epic battle
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:31.220]   I've got the feeling Andy and rene you go home at night and read the transcripts from the trial. I don't know why I just feel like yeah
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:35.140]   It's apples apples not gonna apple is one of the most
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.220]   Close to the vest
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.660]   Control is of their own PR and their own public perception as there is
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:47.940]   These lawsuits are the only opportunity that we have to find out even innocuous stuff that doesn't feel like it means anything
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.500]   Here's how apple operates inside. Here's who is talking to whom when there's a problem
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:59.140]   And here's how fast they were able to react to something. So yeah, this is a treasure trope a trove of information
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:06.580]   Um, I mean this happened by the way with sam sung and google as well with other trials discovery as a bitch
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.500]   Yeah, it's a good rene the best thing ever you wouldn't know anything about like the early history of anything if we didn't have
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.660]   It's really true thing for me. Right
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.660]   The thing for me that's hilarious about all of this
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.820]   Isn't that isn't the companies like the companies? I expect apple to say that you know
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.860]   We're doing this we're fighting for the privacy of the user and I expect epic to say we're on the side of the developer
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:32.020]   And I know I don't believe any of that but but the coverage is so depressing to me because nobody acts like these are businesses
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.260]   They're buying completely into either
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:41.540]   They're doing that like they're they're outraged that their businesses are acting like businesses or they've bought all the nonsense about the altruism
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:46.980]   Of these companies and I just like if you boil it all down apple's just saying yes, of course
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:52.340]   We and our favorite partners get the sweetheart deals and epic saying yes, of course
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:57.220]   We want to be you but until we can be you we want the sweetheart deal and that's all they keep lying
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:03.780]   Lying is a harsh word. They just keep saying it's like all the and then people look. Oh look apple discussed apparate commission
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:09.060]   Yes, they would be incompetent if they didn't but it's like oh my god. They they discussed it
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.420]   It's just it's it's exhausting. There's also wait a minute
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:20.180]   You mean you mean that they they didn't provide a version of iMessage for android on the basis that it would help them sell more iphones
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:25.220]   Shocked. I'm shocked. Yes. I'm playing god of war not on an xbox and i'm shocked
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.460]   Here's the uh, here's an example of what you're missing if you don't read the transcripts
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.340]   Thanks to the verges is an exchange between
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.100]   Uh, this is in the sixth day of the trial, uh, epics vice president of marketing math through wisinger
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.500]   And uh apple's attorney and here we go apple attorney
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:48.420]   Uh, we have in front of us a new set of images. Uh, what is what is this uh screen showing?
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.300]   Uh, this is your matchmaking lobby
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:57.540]   Uh, and we have a large yellow banana here. Don't we in a tuxedo?
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.820]   Uh, yeah, that's that's pealy
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.380]   And that's healy did you say?
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.780]   Yeah
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.420]   And in fact in the tuxedo he's known as
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.860]   Agent pealy am I correct sir?
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.580]   Uh, that's correct
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:20.820]   We thought it better to go with the suit than the naked banana since we are in federal court this morning
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:28.260]   Apparently a callback to apple's contention that epic hosts porne on its h.io
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.300]   Game store, which I find not exactly
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.660]   True epic attorney. This is the epic attorney now
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:39.140]   Uh, uh, a little bit of a discretion. We talked about pealy our banana. Remember that?
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.140]   Weissinger I do
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:45.380]   Uh, and there might have been an implication that to show pealy without a suit would have been
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.180]   Inappropriate do you recall that? Yeah
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:52.820]   Is there anything inappropriate about pealy without a suit?
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.220]   No, there is not
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.260]   Uh, if we could just put a put on the screen a picture of pealy
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:03.540]   Who is by the way again a banana is there anything inappropriate about pealy without clothes?
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:09.060]   Uh, it's it's just a banana man. He's so right. He's so right
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:14.580]   So so I mean and remember there's no jury here. This is all for the judge
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.300]   Who must just be going so much pity and empathy for her. I know I know
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.420]   You guys grow up
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:26.900]   Grow up. It's just a banana. It's embarrassed. It's a little embarrassing
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:32.820]   I felt if it reminded me of every time when I was a little kid and I was in such deep trouble with my dad
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:39.380]   And he wanted to extend the pain by saying so you wanted to set a start a fire. Yes. Well, yes
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:48.260]   What and and you decide and you decided that maybe the the the the stairwell inside the basement was the best place to set that fire
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:54.900]   Well, yeah, and why didn't you choose to say do the bar fire in the fire pit in the backyard?
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   Well
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:03.540]   You just want you just you just feel like being walked into the kilter your honor. I submit this man is guilty
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.740]   Just one more question
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:12.260]   Addie robertson dad had to say I had a tweet that was so good. I had a book market
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.420]   Reads. He's quoting part of the part of the uh, the the conversation lawyer
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.300]   Quote a death run is where the player has to make it across the island without getting killed correct
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:26.980]   And then out he said this testimony is way more fun if you imagine it's a mad scientist being put on trial for war crimes
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:32.340]   Uh actually we call that a corpse run. I just want to say but okay
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:39.060]   Uh is this entertainment site the verge actually changed their tagline to what the lawyer said in court. It was brilliant. Oh so funny
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.620]   Uh, what was the tagline?
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.420]   Do you have it like are you familiar with the verge and they're like, yes, it's it's some sort of entertainment
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:57.700]   Property. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh here it is. Yeah, some kind of entertainment type website
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:02.660]   Good on you good on you verge
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.380]   That's like
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:11.380]   Hey, he couldn't have said it in court if it wasn't true. I would I would be promoting the hell out of that. I'd be very proud
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.900]   Hey, you said we were entertainment type
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.100]   It's some kind of entertainment type website
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:25.060]   Uh, so what else have we learned we learned that a little bit more about the app review process? I was glad to know this
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.220]   This was all very interesting
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.260]   In a document filed with the trial
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:35.940]   Uh, this is from tristan cosminka who is one of the heads of the app store for apple
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.980]   Uh cosminka said five this is amazing five million apps
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.620]   Are submitted to the store every year
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.660]   Uh, the app rejection rate is less than 40 percent
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.820]   Of those rejected 215,000
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:58.820]   Uh, which is what out of 1.7 million infringed privacy guidelines in some way
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:03.300]   So that's really not most of the problems in there 500 people
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:09.220]   So let me let me do some math because there's 500 people that's about a 100,000 apps
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.940]   a week
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:16.500]   And which would be uh, if my math is correct 20,000 apps a day
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:22.500]   Which would if my math is correct be 400 apps per day per person
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:29.220]   So if you worked in eight hour day, that's 50 apps an hour. That's a lot of apps to go through fast
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.300]   You got about a minute per app, right?
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:36.980]   Uh, I guess they have do they use they use automated tools to do that, right?
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:42.740]   Yeah, most of the time automated tools and one of the most interesting pieces of uh, evidence from here was a
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:51.140]   Photo of one of the testers actual workstations. That's just like eight nine ten screens, including an apple tv screen every device screen possible
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:56.660]   Uh, and the the amount of work that have to hands when it comes to the point of having to do a hands-on exploration
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:00.100]   That yeah, it's not a it's not a simple linear process. Yeah
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.140]   um
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.100]   They also say that only about 1%
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.300]   Of people of developers appeal rejections most of them just fix it
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:18.180]   Um, which probably tells you also something about the nature of the rejection. It's not something difficult to
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.820]   To change or fix, you know
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.460]   In most cases. I think that's probably the case. Although 1% of 1.7 million is not
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.820]   Then in significant number. That's quite a few people who appeal
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.260]   Uh, what else do what else have we learned?
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:41.300]   Uh, is that is that the is that the extent of our learnings from this week's epic apple update? I think so
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.100]   Uh, there there was one
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.740]   whether a story slash non-story
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.780]   About what happened in the 2017 hack
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.260]   uh, where uh
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.460]   Where xcode a legal version of xcode that was put that was available in china
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.660]   Was used to inject malware spyware into a bunch of iOS apps that actually made it onto the app store
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.420]   And they include the so the testimony included a lot of the or excuse me
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:13.220]   Or at least the evidence that was presented included a lot of the conversations inside of apple about what to do about it where it was caught fairly
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.020]   What they they made a lot of movements
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:22.340]   As soon as they discovered it, but there was a conversation about well potentially 125 million iPhones were affected by this
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:26.820]   Should we inform all of these users about how how should we inform you about this problem?
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.340]   Yes
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.420]   And so there was a conversation about well, we'll have to localize the warning for
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:36.980]   For multiple different markets, yeah, and they did and in the end there
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:42.180]   It depended you could tell the how part is on certain news agencies are some of them say oh well apple
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.740]   covered up hundred 200 120
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.340]   Had a had a
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.780]   Security problem with 125 million users and they didn't tell any of them
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.500]   Are and the others would be more sober and say well they just decided the best way to do it
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.980]   Which is to say hey, we had the sort of a breach they've talked about it in broad as possible terms
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.380]   Here are some of the apps that have been affected unfortunately there were thousands of them so you couldn't just really
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.220]   2500 and they only mentioned the top 25 so
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.140]   But they but that was probably I don't think that was in the testimony
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.340]   But that was I'm betting that was probably based on well how many how many
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:20.260]   How many people would have been affected by the top five and that would probably have covered nearly all of them
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:24.980]   Yeah, like I said if you if you present someone but hey check this list of 2500 apps to see if you've been affected by this
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.420]   That's a long list
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:32.180]   Yeah, did apple kill the other thing is if apple has the ability I don't know if they did it to take pull all those apps off your phone
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.140]   I don't think they did I think they pulled them all from the app store
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:41.060]   But there was some concern that those apps could still be on your phone installed. Yeah
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:49.780]   Um, so this I thought this I don't know you think this I thought this I understand why apple didn't want to send 125 million emails
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:55.300]   Out in 33 languages. Yeah. Yeah, I can understand the difficulty and yet
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:01.860]   It feels as if they didn't they they might have downplayed this most it could have been more aggressive
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.580]   I think this was this was the x code ghost
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:10.180]   Which was offered mostly chinese developers as a version of x code from chinese servers
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:16.500]   You could download faster in fact it carried a mal mware payload that allowed arbitrary execution of code
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:23.060]   On iPhones that could you be used to x field trade information from iphones most of the people downloading it were in china?
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.660]   um
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:29.380]   18 million in the us but 128 million total so most of them were in china
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.700]   Uh, and because it was mostly chinese apps that used this and then there's probably
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:38.820]   I guess it's speculative, but I would speculate that maybe this was the chinese government looking to
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.540]   Um, you know get some apps on the phone that they could use to spy on their
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:47.060]   Citizens, but that's purely speculative on my part
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.820]   Um, I
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:53.780]   You may and that might though have had something to do with apples reluctance to make too big a deal of it. I don't know
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:43:01.940]   Um for 4,000 apps actually a total apple new of 2,500 but uh, but malware researchers say
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.060]   4,000 total apps impacted
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.660]   This is the sort of stuff that we're very very grateful for because
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:12.900]   I'm a big fan of accountability. It's one thing for apple to say that oh well
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.900]   We've got the most we've got a
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.060]   Trustworthy secure safe place to get apps that's fine
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:23.300]   And I'm sure that that is your goal, but how well are you doing towards that goal would have been the slip-ups
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.740]   They're not going to talk about that
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:29.860]   So if they're going to make a statement again getting back to the ftc if you make a promise about something you have to be able to defend that promise
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:36.100]   And unfortunately we only get stories like these when there is a discovery phase of an important trial and this is
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.620]   I'm sure that apple realizes that
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:46.980]   This lawsuit is probably going to go away and end in their favor, but it's just the first it's just rehearsal for the big
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:53.140]   Court problems that are going to be having defending their choices and running the app store because that is the target
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:59.060]   That is the that is the thermal the the thermal support exhaust port on the death star in terms of regulatory
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:06.420]   Agencies attacking attacking apple. It's all about the app store apple also said at the time that there was they never thought that
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:10.100]   There was no information to suggest the malware is used for any malicious purpose
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:16.660]   And and now that we know it's so widely distributed. I have to say how would you know
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:20.180]   And that might is using it, huh?
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.140]   Or who else is using it?
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.180]   You know the act the person who has the exploit you don't know the other 10 people who have the
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.580]   Yeah, yeah, so
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.980]   Apple I think you could say I don't want to
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:38.500]   I think it'd be safe to say apple downplayed it. Is that fair Andy? I I agree with that
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:43.620]   I do think they could have been a lot more aggressive. Um, I was disagree my only disagreement was with the
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.300]   The strength of some of the headlines that was based on this
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.540]   Uh, because it is technically true that they did not they could they
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:56.900]   They could have informed every they certainly have records of who has downloaded what app when
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:02.420]   And so they certainly had the ability to say here's a list of everybody who might have downloaded an app that we know to have been in
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.180]   Affected by this malware. They apparently did not do that
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:11.620]   That was certainly within their power and they certainly I think that that would have been prudent if they really want to
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:18.740]   Uh, if they really want to keep that crown on their head about being we are the company that runs the best app store that protects its users
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.780]   Most aggressively, however, I don't think that it goes
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:28.260]   It falls all the way into the category of they were irresponsible. They were reckless. They were derelict in the responsibility
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.300]   They had a response. It was just not the best response for users
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.740]   Well, there's two ways if you want to say we have the most secure app store
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:41.220]   There's two ways to assert that one is to have it actually be secure. The other would be to say we have the most secure app store
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:46.580]   Here's how low the bar is. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, so, uh, there's also
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:51.940]   Uh, in in the same of discovery information about the uh, this jekyll app a researcher
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.900]   Show that you'd be possible put a benign app on
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:46:00.980]   Uh, it through the app review process get it on the phone and then modify it in such a way that would it would then be dangerous
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:07.620]   And then actually upset phil shiller in the email, um, uh, exchange. He said, you know, we got it. This is not good
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:13.860]   We got to fix this because uh, and that's what epic did. Yeah, yeah, right exactly here
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:19.780]   Here as you mentioned the uh, the the images from apple's app review processes. This is steven trattin smith
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.460]   Tweeting this
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:27.220]   Uh, it seems like he says they create a trust score of your app based on a list of binary and metadata criteria
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.300]   And then review what's changed between versions
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:39.940]   Um, of course. Yeah, do you think the first time the first version that goes up in the store then gets a more scrutiny than then subsequent revisions?
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.340]   Is that's what that implies, right?
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:46.580]   They might have kind of side on my automate the uh, the update
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:51.140]   Process one of the faults that internally they identified was that
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.060]   Um, uh, uh,
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:59.380]   One fault in their review process was that they were checking for calls to apis, but they weren't checking the apis themselves
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:04.420]   Right that that's what shiller was mad about he said that's exactly what how jekyll got through
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.620]   Yeah, uh, yeah, so that's what he was actually mad about here's another image from the netflix
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:16.100]   App reviewers claim app submissions as they go through and then are noted find which elements have changed since the
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.900]   last approved version
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.940]   so
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.620]   Thank you, steven trent and smith for for finding all this in the epic material
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:28.660]   It's I have to say I have not been I have not been reading every single part of the transfer because as we have seen
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:34.900]   So much of that is and so how would you define mouse click would it have to be done with a mouse?
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:39.460]   No, uh, well, could it be done with a trackpad? Yes. Well, how about a pointy device?
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:45.140]   Yes, and because they because all these all these people being deposed are trained that the answer to the question
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:49.220]   Do you know what time it is is not it's 654. It is yes. I know what time it is
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.060]   And this is just it was just have to walk them through that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:58.180]   That was such a disaster. They can't define a video game. Nobody can define a video game except they know it when they see it
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.420]   It was the worst. Wow
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.660]   But that again and he's pointing out
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:06.740]   Very importantly you read these transcripts you might assume all this is idiotic
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:11.860]   But that is roblox of video game the witnesses are taught not to over answer right?
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:16.580]   Merely answer exactly the question you're asked don't be helpful in other words
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:22.740]   And uh normal words you're great with the politician. Where's like, what was the question? Can you repeat that? I don't recall what was a question?
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.820]   Can you repeat that? I don't recall right right?
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.820]   Let's waste as much time as uh as possible apparently apples
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.940]   Apple has made
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:37.700]   Uh some acquisitions in this area trowton smith talks about source dna they got them in 2016
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.260]   for the binary analysis
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.940]   Uh apthority they looked at them, but they didn't acquire them
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:49.620]   Semantic did later isn't this is great. I you got to follow steve because uh his stuff is yeah
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.380]   He's a genius really well. He's also apps for the autistic spectrum
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:58.660]   Yeah, he's just to me. He's he's he's uh, he's the perfect kind of hacker geek
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:02.980]   You know, he's got you want to follow because he really uh, he's he gets in the weeds
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:08.260]   Of the whole thing and he makes grace, which is one of the best apps for autistic spectrum
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:13.780]   Yeah, is he autistic or he just nice? He just no, he's just he's just uh an awesome person
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.540]   Just makes it. Yep. Nice. Yep
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:21.860]   Uh, we should actually talk a little bit about apple's acquisition policies because this is kind of an interesting
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.580]   uh article on
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:29.380]   How apple buys companies and and and and what they do let me see if I can uh find that
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:33.620]   Uh in the rundown. I know it's in here somewhere
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:40.660]   I should have had this ready to go they walk up and they say you're a feature not a platform. We're gonna buy you
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:46.740]   Here's a shiny nickel come along now. Do you want to keep selling sugar water to kids?
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.220]   Yeah, if you want to come and change the world, that's the thing
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:53.060]   You show up on monday for orientation. Make sure you watch the video
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.940]   next
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.700]   And then mark does that he sits in a room for nine months. You don't do anything and you leave
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:03.700]   Very solid very solid. You're talking about uh zucker burg of course
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.460]   Um
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.460]   So say his name three times
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.660]   apple buys this the article i'm trying to find the article
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.300]   I love that he now thinks that the problem with facebook
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.980]   Uh pr is that he hasn't been as personable on social networks as he needs to be
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:21.380]   And that if he's only smiling more on social networks, all their other problems will disappear
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.020]   Such as like a burgian solution
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.940]   More paddle boarding dressed as it the clown. That's what I think he should be doing
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:32.180]   Just live your best life mark
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:39.940]   Oh, well, I am looking through here and I I don't have it here. So, um, it's it came from uh the apple
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:45.860]   Analysts call I guess so it's it's just about how apples attitude towards acquisitions
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.940]   But I guess we we already talked about it. Yeah, they don't do big ones. Yeah, they tend not to do
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:54.020]   Yeah, they're mostly aqua hired. They want the technology or people or yeah
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:51:01.300]   Uh apples by the way, this is kind of breaking news facing a rather large class action suit in the uk
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.260]   For overcharging in the app store
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:10.660]   Damages could be two billion dollars. So add this to the eu's action. This one's a court action
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:16.900]   A lawsuit in uh in the uk filed at london's competition appeal tribunal
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:22.980]   Yesterday it calls for the u.s. Firm to compensate uk iphone and ipad users for years
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.700]   Of alleged overcharging
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:31.140]   They estimate that apple could face paying out in excess of one and a half billion pounds which is 2.1
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:35.140]   billion dollars wait till they find out what the margin is on v bucks and pocoins
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.380]   Just wait
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.620]   The suit described by apple as meritless
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:46.740]   Filed a week into the epic trial and of course the the week after the u also goes after
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:52.500]   The app store. This is how the app store thing they argued about like how easily kids should be able to buy v bucks
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:57.140]   And the judge was like, I'm not sure making it a little bit harder to buy v bucks is a bad thing
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:00.980]   Yeah, and they're like we're just thinking about convenience. We just we just mean convenience
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:06.500]   Sure. Yeah, do you think what do you think it's going if having having followed this now? It's been a couple of weeks
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.500]   uh
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:15.620]   Can you read into the judge's response to uh some of this stuff is do you think she's in feeling one way or the other at this point?
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:22.100]   The analysts are saying that they they largely expect apple to win a trial but then to suffer in regulation afterwards
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:26.660]   And I think that's probably an accurate take because of the things that we're learning about apple
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.700]   I think just the climate the general climate. I think I described it really well last week. Yeah
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:37.460]   Remember that we have 50 states attorneys general that are preparing to work together to pursue antitrust
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:43.700]   activity against big tech that this is almost on it's hard to find a really good precedent for this where
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:52.180]   It's not that we each these states realizes that we don't have the budget to fight facebook directly or fight apple directly or fight even twitter directly
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:56.580]   However, if we share all of the data that we're doing and we sort of part partition things up
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:02.420]   We can really do some damage and have a lot of bargaining power when it comes to looking for a new regulation
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:07.460]   So yeah, this is this is not the start of this not the middle of anything. This is just the start of the start
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:11.140]   Apparently the judge sure this isn't a stimulus package for lawyers
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.780]   At all it always
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.780]   I get for lawyers always
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:20.100]   Hey, man. I I got I got 31 dollars because I was being overcharged by at and t man
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:24.740]   That is that is like not just a take up read. Oh, that's like dinner at a mexican restaurant
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:33.460]   So I got 1750. I can't believe you got 30 bucks, man. Well, I got a lamborghini in a castle. Yeah, right
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:41.860]   Well, there's a lot of us and fewer of those. Oh, oh, like like I'm going to be parking my lamborghini in front of tracked housings
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.660]   Okay
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:51.300]   Uh, the judge does apparently judge rogers apparently objects to epics continued attempts
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:56.020]   To admit some documents into evidence epic is obviously going for the scorched earth
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:59.220]   You know, let's let's make this look as bad for apple as possible
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:02.820]   Uh questioning the relevancy in some cases
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:07.700]   Um, and I think epic is probably just saying look let's use this discovery as opportunity to
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:12.660]   To hurt apple in general whether it helps us in the trial or not
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:18.020]   It helps it helps them to speed up a conclusion of the trial. It's favorable to spotify
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.820]   It's so many when you look at history so many wars are not fought based on we will win this war
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.740]   It's though we will win the negotiation in the negotiated settlement later on
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.140]   And I think that this is I think
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:36.100]   Despite having having been a very powerful start off the blocks when they filed the suit when apple did not
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.660]   Instantly fold or acquiesce
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:45.940]   They became how much pressure can we put on apple to make to basically let's negotiate and settle this so that they never had
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:50.580]   They don't have to keep a lot of their vice presidents and executives and depositions, but they don't have to keep
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.500]   uh
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.060]   Offering shoveling all this information to journalists
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:55:01.700]   For commentators to make really really snarky comments about so this is all about maintaining pressure
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:02.980]   What about the revelation?
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.540]   I think we always knew this that some developers are whitelisted and can use their own stores hulu
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:12.260]   It turns out could use could switch switch from app store billing to hulu
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.020]   billing
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:18.260]   Uh, I we I think amazon got that kind of privileges as well at one point
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:19.860]   That's the part i was talking about at the beginning
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:24.580]   It's like that is like if I buy 12 oranges, I get slightly less per orange than if I buy
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:30.500]   You know like one orange and it's those those general business things that typically like these are our best customers
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:33.540]   These are our peers these people can hurt us the same way we can hurt them
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:38.340]   These aren't just generic customers. We have to cave to them on some of these issues and that's just business
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.500]   But anytime it but apple first says we don't
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:44.740]   We treat every developer the same which is nonsense like it's we know it's nonsense
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:49.780]   And I hate that I hate when a company says something that we know is fake because they think we're too dumb to know that it's false
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.340]   That that's means like the worst one of the worst things
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.940]   But then people react to it like oh my god, there's business going on in these businesses
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:00.500]   And it's like but that's exactly what we expect that they can negotiate amazon can say you you're not
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:06.020]   We're not gonna put prime on your dingle box if you don't give us this on your phone dicky do hickey
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:09.860]   And apple like oh damn, okay. It's amazon. We can't just force them
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:15.060]   And there's so much of their arguments that makes perfect sense. It's like if if i'm a professional house painter
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:19.780]   Why do why am I forced to to hire somebody to paint my house as part of the agreement?
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:23.940]   I have of living in this living in this neighborhood. That's the situation where look at where amazon
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:28.340]   We know we've minimized our cost for payment processing. We've got that on lock
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:33.460]   We can pay a lot more for payment processing than you're going to charge us for processing these payments
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:39.860]   Why are you demanding that we use you're far more expensive and certainly far less useful for our purposes payment system
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.900]   Uh, you you're we're gonna have to negotiate our way out of this
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:50.500]   There was also an email from matt fissure vp of app store apparently at one point apple's accessibility team
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:58.740]   Wanted an app store editorial feature on apps that implemented voiceover support and they they wanted to include google and amazon applications
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.900]   and uh
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:02.020]   matt fissure
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:08.260]   Well, an apple executive wrote that matt matt fissure feels extremely strongly about not featuring our competitors
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:10.740]   on the app store
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:16.260]   On the stand fissure said, uh, no, that's not true. We've repeatedly promoted apps that are competitors, but they
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.140]   They do have that one email
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:26.020]   Um, you know, I checked and there's a lot of features for those apps which is a weird again like it's just a weird thing to say
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:28.340]   Yeah, yeah
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:30.420]   Yeah, and you know, I can think
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.260]   To say and that one executive doesn't like that is maybe
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.900]   A little indirect and so not exactly uh germane
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:40.820]   Um
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:46.820]   Let's take a little break. I want to talk about a big apple higher and what you all think about that in just a little sec
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:50.100]   But first a word from our sponsor

[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:44.900]   In those tricky zones. Let me let me open it up and i show you it's kind of it's kind of cute
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:49.700]   Three precision blades extra wide lubricating strips
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:55.300]   Impossible to get into that's to keep your lady out of there. Look how little this is is so cute
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.660]   Um nice. Yeah and a pivoting head
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:03.380]   So you really you need this let me just put it this way. There's a reason
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:07.220]   This is so uh delicate shall we say
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:11.700]   It's not your average razor it's smaller, but it's thicker so it's easy to hold
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:18.180]   The micro comb bar allows for the best shave possible from any angle. You know about the micro comb bar
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.740]   I've i've been learning about the micro comb bar
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.700]   all three of these
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:28.980]   Of course vegan and cruelty free because you wouldn't you wouldn't want to test this out
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.980]   On a goat or a llama or anything that would just be cruel
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:37.780]   Uh, also also the three blades and the glides that's also cruelty free free
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:42.500]   For your own person. So yes cruelty is skip over that one need not be cruel to one cruel tpkins
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.540]   That don't look good. Yes. These are all sulfate free as well
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.340]   So actually actually that is sincerely true
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:55.060]   You don't want to put a lot of chemicals in the more sensitive areas of your anatomy. So you really do want to have something that's designed
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:03:01.060]   Uh particularly for that part. I don't know if you have you ever used I don't want to get too intimate here
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.980]   But if you've ever used a shave gel not intended
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:11.540]   For those areas it really can get a little spicy. I mean just let me just put it that way you you really want the car
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:17.540]   It's a member. It's a memorable experience. It's something you'll never forget later. It's it's what dog trainers would call a corrective action

[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.860]   Malvea

[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.060]   La zone don't relay jump don't relay jump
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:29.620]   I think they left out with you. They're like between the legs. It's all cultural differences
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:35.300]   Oh, you think that's the Canadian way to say it huh? Mmm. And well, we'd say with a Quebec or accent too. So
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:39.940]   On we go with the show big new hire
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.980]   Cisco's uh former
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:48.340]   Uh head of pr Stella low is now head of pr replacing
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.580]   Phil shiller
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:57.540]   And apple former communications chief. Yeah. Now. So did so didn't Phil shiller
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:06.420]   Wasn't he replaced by jaws or no, that's not I don't understand what happened. So yeah, so when stie um when steve left apple
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:10.260]   Uh, Phil took over running the pr group and
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:16.900]   When phil became an apple fellow he gave marketing over to jaw as like worldwide product marketing went over to greg jaws
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:20.420]   We act but he kept the app store. He kept apple events
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:25.380]   He's he's still running all the apple events and he kept leadership of the pr group and now that's going to
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:30.980]   Tast I see I see so uh it takes two to get the job that phil used to do all by himself
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.940]   Uh done. Well, I mean
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:41.940]   Previously they had a VP of pr. He steve just left dowling left. Oh, that's right. So she's really replacing dowling as much as she's replacing
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.460]   Okay
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:47.860]   Okay, yeah, phil was like interming it until they found it got it got it got it got it
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:52.820]   She was senior vice president of communications at del. She worked at unisys
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:06:00.020]   Uh, she will report to no one lower than tim cook. She's a direct report to the ceo
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:03.540]   Uh, guess we'll all get to know
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:09.540]   It's like dowling was steves was a tim's body person the same way katie cotton was steve's body person
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:14.020]   My guess is that the most one of the most important parts of this is to be that person for tim
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:18.420]   Yeah, you'd see that with seave jobs would go to mac world or whatever she she would hover
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:22.180]   Yeah, they're they'd be same with dowling and tim cook. Yeah. Yeah
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:25.300]   So presumably we'll see more of stella low
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:30.660]   Uh, I I know nothing about her. Um, I assume she's a good hire
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:36.500]   Yeah, she has a good track record. She was only recently at sisco
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.940]   She started there just a couple of years ago
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:40.420]   She used to be based in new england moved there a couple of years ago
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:46.660]   The fact that she that she was snapped up so quickly kind of indicates the amount of respect that they that apple would have for a particular
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.140]   Someone who is reporting directly to tim
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.860]   the only surprise on my part is that uh, I
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:57.460]   I would not have been let's say I would not have been surprised if they had chosen someone who maybe was not necessarily
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:00.980]   Primarily tech oriented someone who was very very well versed in
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:04.260]   Uh, I don't want to go as far as to say disaster pr
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:10.420]   But here is when when the company is due to spend the next five years being assaulted on all sides by regulators
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:17.140]   You need to be able to present a very very balanced view of who your company is what they stand for and what they actually contribute
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.660]   And so I'm sure she i'm sure she's on top of it
[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:24.820]   But I'm so i'm not saying that i'm not saying that i'm disappointed or surprised that they made this kind of a choice
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:30.340]   I'm just saying that I would not have been surprised if they had chosen someone who had, uh, experience and a
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:37.060]   a company of of comparable size, but not necessarily in the same industry that is used to dealing with
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:41.940]   Government legislation being part of their portfolio
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:47.940]   Clearly she she is well known in the business press as well
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:53.140]   And that's probably a lot of where the battle gets fought is is in the press right in getting people
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.060]   Dallin came from cnbc right so he was a journalist who went to apple and became
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:01.060]   Head of corporate communications and then went katie retired right became
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:06.340]   VP of pr so this is a different direction so actually dallin's been good for for two years
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:12.340]   So it really has I guess you could say this this role has been empty for two years, but they really do need some
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:16.980]   I mean feel super capable. Yeah. Yeah, he's good. Yeah. Good. Yeah
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:23.700]   Interesting thing for me is that the person who went the person who used to run tesla pr and now runs facebook pr is former apple
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:28.420]   pr so they're obviously well versed at dealing with some of the most controversial companies
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:31.940]   In the world so I think that that part they might feel like
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:37.860]   They have a bit of a hand in law and they probably want somebody who's do you think they were looking for a wartime consuliary?
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.340]   I mean, is it is it really that crisis?
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:45.300]   Focus I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't say so because they could have made a much more aggressive choice here
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.340]   I think they were looking for someone who came with the right portfolio of skills
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:53.380]   I think the most important thing by far would have been how compatible are you with the culture here at apple?
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:58.500]   Because the people that they hire they tend they they tend to hire people who stay there for the rest of their careers
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.940]   They don't have people who's who leave to start their own companies at that sort of
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:06.660]   Direct report level. So a lot of it was probably wanting to find out is this someone who?
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.740]   Understands what we're about
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:14.020]   Who knows exactly not what our immediate goals are but what our goals are for the history the company have been
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:16.740]   And is this someone that is this someone who will
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:23.060]   Be be good to work for but also not hesitant to say why aren't you why are you still here in this meeting?
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:27.060]   Why aren't you out directly on it enough like to China right now to solve the problem that we just talked about?
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:29.960]   So that's probably that's probably why she was
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.500]   First job is right like they don't want to brow it again. Yeah, that didn't turn out well for anybody
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:40.740]   Yeah, her first job is go over to dxomark with a bag of cash and say what can we do to improve our scores?
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:43.300]   because
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:48.820]   I would be happy if apple never mentioned dxomark. I get sad anytime any of them tweet dxomark. I know
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:50.820]   uh or
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.900]   Displaymates or I'm not disparaging these for legal purposes. I'm not disparaging
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:57.780]   These companies sometimes it seems a little odd
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:03.060]   The biggest problematic that the companies that pay consulting fees to learn how to do good at the test
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:08.260]   Well at the test end up doing well at the tests. I think those are those things shouldn't be should not be in the same company. Yeah
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.700]   uh
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.540]   apples iphone
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.540]   12 pro max coming in fourth
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:16.260]   in the dxomark battery
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:20.660]   Competition after the samson galaxy m51
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:25.460]   The weco power u30 and the apo find x3 neo
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:30.100]   You know, you're always going to be able to find phones like that then have great battery life that aren't great phones
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:34.660]   I mean, it looks like google stopped paying for consulting completely. I don't see google on here at all
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:38.820]   Uh then vivo wa whey shao me one plus
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:44.340]   Motorola g9 power where I could testify to that I gave my daughter that's got great battery life
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.620]   The s s 21 ultra from samson
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:52.980]   Uh, it's kind of way down the list there. It's it's uh the most expensive phone
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:59.220]   Uh on the list actually it reminds me of those classic consulting rackets were like oh you want your business to go up
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:04.100]   Two points in the magic quadrant. Well, that'll be you know a hundred thousand dollars in consulting fees
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:08.900]   I'll look at that you went down. Yeah, or hey, we're having an industry awards banquet
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:13.620]   Yeah, how many seats at our $10,000 table can we put you down for and that i'm not i'm not even joking
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:20.180]   That's like literally oh no no. We weren't soliciting anything. We're just celebrating our industry here and yeah, yeah
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:23.780]   Um, hey speaking of the royals
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:30.100]   We were before the show because the queen gave her a annual speech to parliament today in a i'm told now
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:35.780]   That that is not a gray suit. That is a what do they say a lavender gray suit
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:39.380]   some top
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:45.540]   Speaking of the royals prince harry's apple tv plus mental health docu series that he's doing with oprah
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.900]   Oh, oh really harry and oprah working together. What is shock
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:56.180]   Uh to premiere on may 21st. It's called the me you can't see executive produced by uh
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.980]   oprah and prince harry and i see
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:01.540]   Some other famous people they had a joke
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:04.020]   Gaga and they had a joke headline with
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:09.780]   Gwyneth paltrow saying that oh, oh my god during the quarantine. I had to eat bread and drink wine
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.620]   Oh shocking and people at first really but it was meant to insan
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:19.140]   This is the same thing as like isn't it meant to incense people because like you're like a prince and you're not seen and uh
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.780]   You know, yeah, this is this isn't this isn't like when they signed
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:30.820]   The obamas to be producers because they have had they have led extremely meaningful lives
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:36.500]   That have an abreast of experience that they I think they need to share with the rest of the world
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:41.380]   I'm not saying that the that the they're not the royals are not good people
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:47.380]   I'm just saying that what what about their experience suggests that they are have a they have an insider point of view
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.580]   That's going to be good for a mass audience. It's I apologize
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:55.540]   I've just been handed this note from the producers. It was lilac gray. Thank you very much
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:59.700]   Lilac gray. Can I just kind of say that you we have disclaimer
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:04.340]   Litt listeners listeners of the UK you got your issues with the royals do do whatever you have to do
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.500]   But find a way to hold on to black rod
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.100]   That is my favorite part of like british tradition that you have
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:17.380]   That his or her in this case her title is black rod because she carries a black rod that she pounds on the door
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:23.860]   A good title of the such slaters demanding to be led is the black rod not any old black rod the black rod
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.260]   Yes
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:31.380]   Anyway, thank you web 3604. It's lilac gray
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:35.140]   I want to make sure we corrected that the record
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:38.980]   This is part of apples multi-year deal with opra
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:46.340]   Uh, it's unclear according to nine to five mac if prince harry's personal mental health struggles will be part of the show
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.500]   In the me you can't see opra and prince harry
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:54.020]   Guide honest discussions about mental health and emotional well-being
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.620]   I mean clearly this does
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:02.580]   You know need to be discussed without stigma in an open way and I guess if you want to destigmatize something you have famous people
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:07.860]   Uh celebrities and others say yeah, I'm suffering from this uh, too, you know that that's true
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.620]   I I I wish to partially retract what I said. I didn't know it's
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:14.500]   Especially when somebody of that kind of a high profile
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:19.060]   Uh makes that kind of a that kind of a I don't take it as admission. It's yeah
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:23.140]   Yeah, I mean, well, no, I just I just realized that yeah, that that would be a very very powerful thing
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:28.500]   Well, but it's also I mean, I you know, oh glen close and lady gaga having emotional problems
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.820]   Oh, I'm so sorry prince harry so sorry
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:35.940]   You know, but but at the same time I think for people who are you know going through things
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:39.380]   It's maybe it's it's helpful to see somebody you you're we talk
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:44.900]   We talk openly about things that we as a society consider to be normal if that's right talking over openly about
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.500]   Society saying that this is not normal. That's so this is why we need openness
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:54.260]   I'm actually curious to see what oprah's show with john steward is going to be like she's that's coming later this year
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:15:00.100]   That should be very interesting a current. I'm glad i'm so glad i'm so glad to see him come back because i've i've
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:05.060]   All admits that I don't i've never i was he's never in my cup of tea as a comedian
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:10.180]   I've i've when he was doing the daily show even i'm like, please just don't let other people try to be funny
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:14.740]   Every time you try to be funny. I just have to mute for a couple minutes and walk around the room a bit
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.380]   But as a managing editor he has
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:24.820]   Extremely gifted talents there. Yes, and i'm glad to see and and he's been sharing that talent and inspiring other people
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:31.700]   To create shows that are in that's kind of vain. So really if all if all the announcement was that he's going to be editorial director of a new
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:34.100]   Uh news edder tainment division
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.740]   You know what that might even get me to subscribe to a channel
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:40.420]   Otherwise because he is such a profound talent in that regard
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:43.940]   Uh
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:49.220]   When's ted lasso coming back more importantly soon? It's really soon isn't it?
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:53.060]   Uh, I hope so
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:57.380]   Are they so they're actually filming they had the trailer. Yeah the last event. Yeah, that's right. Yeah
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:00.260]   And the and the shortbread recipe. Yes
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:03.060]   Yes, there is a rumor
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.780]   Take it as you will. I mean, I think we're
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:11.300]   You know, we're only about three weeks away from an apple event that will announce some stuff
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.540]   I'm excited. I'm hoping we're gonna see a new macbooks
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:21.620]   There is a rumor that apple will introduce the new macbook in iMac style colors
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:26.340]   That would kind of make sense the iBook i love i love love this rumor
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:28.900]   It was because the there's been such a small
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:33.380]   Such a small perceptual difference between the air and the pro
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:35.940]   Partly because if they've kind of kneecap the the pro
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:41.380]   But to make the air the fun computer that costs as little as you can possibly spend for a mobile mac
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:45.300]   And if you want to pink one, we'll give you pink one you want a green one or purple one
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.300]   We'll sell you a green one or purple one. You don't have to
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:52.580]   We're no longer offering you the dazzling array of gray or a slightly different shade of gray
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:58.020]   Gray or silvery gray. I love you know, I like the orange is beautiful and so forth in the two tone
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.580]   I hope they don't do white bezels, but uh, I bet they do if they know they will
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:03.780]   Yeah
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:08.900]   The picture well the one that prosser said he saw will had white keys and white bezels. Yeah
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:16.660]   It's pretty. You know, I'm looking. This is a render from a fan. Not a not an actual picture, but it's pretty I would I would you know, that's pretty
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:21.860]   I wouldn't be even pleased to see it. The design is different too. The witch design. Yeah. Yeah, prosser
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:27.700]   Said apple has been testing prototypes which one would expect in more colors including a blue blue one
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:31.860]   Prosser source suggests apple will bring in colors for average consumers
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:38.900]   So you keep the slate gray for pros and yes, because we're boring because we're so boring
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:44.260]   Yeah, I would like to buy a pro in color
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:50.340]   Please yeah, I would have I you know, I didn't want to have a gray ipad pro
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:56.580]   I would if there'd been a purple one. I would have absolutely purple one and look how well the various colors sell
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.220]   You know that people love it
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:01.540]   It's also
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:07.220]   Yeah, we we look at what they're compared to every other computer that you see like at the star books with the coffee shop
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.540]   Every single one of them is like as boring
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:14.420]   And the the mac books the macbook air there's boring is every other every computer out there used to be that we were
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:21.300]   Used to remember the the original iBook like let's take a toilet seat lid and try to base a whole computer design philosophy around that
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:24.580]   And i'll be i'll be damned. It was it was cool. It worked
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:32.820]   Uh, okay, so that's that's you you changed man. You used to be used to be fun
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:40.660]   What happened man? Here's an interesting youtube from a guy who's taken the air tag stripped off the unnecessary stuff
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:42.740]   And made it
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.740]   Walletable
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:49.780]   It's funny how people really tearing these apart and breaking them down and I fix has done that and so he's gonna make it
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:54.420]   Just get the guts of the air tag so that you can put it in your wallet. This is uh,
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:56.020]   Andrew
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:57.540]   Uh guy
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:00.100]   I don't know how you say his name. I'm sure i'm saying that wrong or what?
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:03.620]   Ng in vietnamese is what isn't it? Why?
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:07.060]   What is it?
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.220]   I think i thought it was not but i'm not sure. I don't know
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:15.300]   This is cool. So he's got this he's printed. He's 3d printed a, uh, little holder for the battery
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:20.260]   Nice job, Andrew. Sure. Yeah there look it popped up. There you go. He found it
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.260]   an air tag
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:27.540]   That's that's a good feeling a card sized air tag. This is not approved by apple
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:28.740]   if you take a look at the
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:32.500]   No, that's that's a but that's a very positive thing because
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:40.420]   It's useful so long as it stays with your bags days with your wallet if you if the first thing that a that's a thief does is like rip
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:44.660]   This visible f or mez tag off of you. Okay. Well, they wouldn't rip it off. They would sell it
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:48.580]   But imagine imagine you spent $12 on a still on an Amazon right
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:54.180]   But yeah, there if you make it something that is just slipped into a pocket that they're not going to find it until they've been
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:56.900]   They've been tracked for about a day and a half. That's such a positive thing
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:01.140]   And I look and this is this is very much in the in the spirit of apple. They don't again
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:04.580]   We're the crazy ones. We're the ones who say gee if I could if I take this apart
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:08.580]   Is there a way that can make this into something even cooler and I'm glad that they
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:13.380]   Glad that didn't apple didn't just like arbitrarily say there must be some way so that
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:17.220]   We'll fill we'll fill this chamber with argon gas and if the gas goes away
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:21.380]   We will disable the entire thing just to be the the company based on no fun
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:24.100]   a German hacker
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.580]   named stack smashing his
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:31.940]   Modified the NFC URL. He says it's a jailbreak for the air tag
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:33.540]   I don't know if that counts as a jailbreak
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:36.980]   But he has been able to modify the URL on the NFC tag
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.700]   stack smashing net
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:46.180]   Doc's masha, you know if somebody has your attack in their hot little hand
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:49.220]   They could do anything they want with it. So if they have physical possession of your air
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:51.780]   Yeah, you're at a right exactly. Yeah
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.380]   Uh, you are you ready for a titanium?
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:00.100]   Apple card coming to your family members. I don't know
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:06.980]   That's no, we've lost the academic edition the steve lost academic edition the apple card you can slice meat with cut cut a steak with yeah
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:13.300]   Yeah, steve carries a metal business card that he says he can get on an airplane so he can cut a steak with
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:16.420]   Okay
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.500]   Okay
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:23.860]   What happened what happened to like us as a culture now we have like billionaires like oh I I spent a hard
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:27.700]   I spent a half a billion dollars on a yacht with another yacht that goes on to it
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:30.820]   That's jeff Bezos. We used to have cool like hey, I'm a billionaire
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:34.340]   I'm gonna I'm gonna carry on two dollar bills on a on a gummed pad
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:39.780]   And I'm gonna put on music festivals because I want to see bands that I want to see we used to have cool billionaires for god's sake
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.420]   Uh
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:47.300]   Anything else did I miss anything before we go to our picks of the week anything else you want to talk about?
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:54.580]   Oh, I think I think we got it all. I mean, I've skipped a few things, but I don't you know
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:58.580]   I don't we don't have to be complete. I don't like the cleatest here for instance
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:05.220]   Apple has asked apple watch users are doing a survey if they use any third-party glucose monitoring
[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:09.540]   I wouldn't necessarily assume that that question in a survey means apples about to do it
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:14.500]   There is always that drum beat, but that's a hard thing to do. It's a hard thing to do. Yeah
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:18.900]   There's a company that got a lot there's a company that's got a lot of press about saying that they have we have a new
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:20.900]   There's a a slide deck
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:25.540]   This would be making the rounds by the company that says that we now have like a visible light spectrum sensor
[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:28.340]   appropriate for use on on watches that can
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:31.620]   do some sort of glucose monitoring
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:38.260]   Although they are very cagey about is it good enough so that a type one diabetic can get alerts about get health alerts
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:41.940]   Or is it just sort of a general guidance? Hey, your blood sugar is higher than it was
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:44.980]   Uh this morning or it's just lower than it was this morning
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:52.340]   But even so that would be that is one of the holy grails of fitness band fitness watch manufacturers to get some sort of blood glucose monitoring
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:58.420]   They've they've they've a year a few year they keep making more and more breakthroughs blood oxygen saturation level was a big one
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:03.620]   But now we're getting to the point where uh google was even like making a lot of hay from a pat and say hey
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:07.940]   We're gonna have a contact lens that will that will give your blood glucose because yeah
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.700]   So yeah, and so I mean so long
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:13.300]   It's like you need to have access to the to the wet parts of the body
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:18.900]   In order to get that kind of reading the first company that could get and do it in such a way that the fda would approve it for use
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:23.620]   In a big box prescriptive for it. That would be yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's the moon shot
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:28.420]   Everybody's working on it and I you know still hasn't happened. It's exciting. It makes me think it must be a
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.140]   hard to do
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:35.540]   Yeah, uh, all right. Let's take a little break and when we come back your picks of the week
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:38.580]   boy and boy
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:43.140]   Our show show today brought to you. This is the one thing i'm not going to demonstrate
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:47.780]   But we do have a video so that's close enough by my mattress the castor
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.380]   mattress
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:53.780]   You know I have to say I track my sleep and my sleep tracking
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.580]   I just got the new castor mattress
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:24:00.580]   The part and my sleep tracking has been like 10 points higher
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:05.060]   I have to say I think it's the mattress could be the bedding the pillows
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:10.820]   I we're all castor in the house. I love castor the new castor cooling collection
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:16.820]   This is perfect for summertime. Well anytime we know that you sleep better when you're slightly cool

[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.500]   This is my old my old cast where we didn't shoot a video
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:52.180]   when the new mattress came I just uh, I just said put a little bit now. I want to take a nap
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:59.940]   We've we've had all the castor mattresses the new wave hybrid snow mattress keeps you cool for 12 plus hours
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:04.100]   Pulling heat away from your body for sustained temperature regulation
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:10.180]   A cool to the touch feeling and a much approved tomorrow. I think that mattress is in the guest bedroom. My daughter has a castor at home
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:15.780]   Uh, when she moved to her new apartment, she said that I don't have a bed. So I bought her everything from castor the
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:17.780]   the the
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:23.380]   Bed frame foundation the mattress pillows pillow cases sheets everything
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:29.300]   Uh castors hyper light. I wish that they had to come out with these they had this was just before they came out with them
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:34.260]   They're hyper light sheets. This is so cool. I'm ordering some of these designed with an innovative grid
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:39.220]   Weave that lets the air flow through again. This is about sleeping cool about being breathable
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:42.260]   There's a lightweight duvet that you still get all that plush comfort but
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:48.340]   with optimal temperature control and and let's not forget the mattress protector because that can actually be a
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:52.900]   Blanket below you but with the castor breathable mattress protector
[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:59.060]   Your bed is even cooler by allowing air to flow between your body and your mattress all designed

[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:50.740]   Yeah, the california king is you can get one we have a regular king, but the california king is weird is shorter
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:55.780]   But wider. I don't know is that what is that about? I don't understand. Oh, I let no I I like that
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.460]   I keep every time I shop for new mattress
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:03.220]   I always think of maybe I should get a king this time that way I could have like one third of it devoted to like office space
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:09.380]   I leave it for just for you can sleep in family of four in that thing. They're huge. Yes. No, no
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:12.740]   I'm not joking because like you okay the laptop like I I
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:18.580]   Usually put it on the nightstand but often like I will just like be there when I wake up. There'll be books there
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:21.860]   They'll be oh, yeah, I mean I need office space
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:25.700]   No, and I've done that because then I'll cut and if Lisa goes to bed before I do
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:30.100]   They'll it'll all be on the floor and no I know what she's done, which is kick everything off
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:33.620]   Where are my where are my books my laptop?
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.820]   Why is it all my iPad? Why is it on the floor? Well
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:44.900]   Think leo why do you think why how did it get on the floor because because the books are comfortable on the floor for hours a day?
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:46.500]   You are not
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:47.700]   Perfect
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:50.900]   Andy how about your pick of the week? I like this one actually got two
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:55.620]   Couple of quick ones because I didn't find anything new over the past week that I kind of like enough to recommend
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:29:02.340]   But studio neat canopy that's actually recommended this a few weeks ago as a really nice like sort of origami folding
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:08.660]   Case for your apple magic keyboard that transforms into an easel for your iPad liked it
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:13.940]   I hadn't bought it yet because I having sunk $1400 on the iPad pro. I decided that I'm going
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:18.420]   I'm going to fund the extra money for the extra storage by deferring accessories
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:23.700]   I'm glad I did because someone on twitter was kind of to point out that on amazon studio neat has
[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.500]   Has put them put them half off their $20
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:33.060]   And for 20 bucks for heaven's sake even even if you just want a carrying case for your magic keyboard and you don't care about the easel
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:36.740]   That is good money spent studio neat makes great great stuff
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:41.620]   And so that's that's a really really great deal. I think it's only available through amazon at that price
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:45.860]   But if you go look for studio neat cam canopy, you will see 20 bucks
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:49.060]   It's sold directly from studio needs you know, it's not a knockoff
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:52.500]   Otherwise you be well, why is this why is ab abc?
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:56.980]   Shenzhen tech innovation selling this for half the price of okay?
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:00.900]   Maybe it's because it's a knockoff. I like how great your keyboard looks when you close it up
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:04.100]   I mean that's really nice. Yeah, exactly because unless you got a custom
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:06.580]   I do travel with a keyboard. I'm going to New York for the
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:10.020]   I'm I'm officially vaccinated officially
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:14.500]   Okay, oh to travel so on thursday i'm making a day trip to New York and as usual
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:19.060]   I'm taking a keyboard with me and you can never find a case that is specifically for that keyboard
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:23.620]   And so it's like putting it into like a big big sock that you want something this custom made for it
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:27.060]   So I'm very very pleased to have this and try it out
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:34.020]   The other go ahead. I should just point out that doesn't say which iPad it's for that's because it's it works with all of them even a phone
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:39.060]   It's right. It's just an easel. It's just a stand. Yeah, if you want if you want to use it with a samsung tablet or hb
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:43.860]   HP tablet they they just want their money. They don't they don't morally judge but you do need the
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:48.820]   Rechargeable magic keyboard. That's what it's it will only fit with a magical key magic keyboard
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:52.580]   Don't know if it'll fit with anything else. It's not it doesn't it doesn't have like, you know, uh,
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:56.820]   Security codes double check. It's not like how feel a pack or make a printer cartridge
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:00.580]   But right I think that if you want something that perfectly is designed to fit your magic keyboard
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:05.220]   This is probably going to be the way to go very nice. Um, the other pick is a long long time pick
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:09.780]   Pocket casts, which is my favorite favorite podcaster everywhere
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:15.380]   Every time which is not to say there aren't good ones not to say that apple and google don't make good ones not to say that downcast
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:16.980]   It's not a good one, etc
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:20.980]   but I always come right back to pocket cast because and I
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:25.620]   The one of the developers Russell of honor is as a friend of mine
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:29.060]   We used to do a podcast together and I was talked to him just last night about this
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:32.580]   I said this is it is the cast iron skillet of its category where
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:39.940]   Again, there's the sous vide machine and then there's the instant pot and then there's the special toaster oven that like has a water reservoir
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.540]   So it'll steam as a toast
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:47.620]   But you always keep coming back to that cast iron skillet that you've been using for 12 years that your mom used for 20 years before that
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:51.700]   And that your grandma that used for 30 years before that because it is perfectly tuned for the job
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:58.180]   It's supposed to do which is help you find new podcasts arrange the podcast that you've been listening to and also sort of be a
[01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:02.820]   Central place for for spoken audio listening
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:06.500]   and it's absolutely free because they they were
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:11.140]   Bought out and they got into a partnership with pbs and a couple other broadcasters
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:15.700]   So the to the op itself is free for 10. They get so by the way the pbs sold them
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.740]   Right, so but they've been it's now
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:20.820]   It's so free
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:23.140]   But the point is it's still free and it's not like a crippled free
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:28.020]   They do have podcast plus which I'm more than happy to pay for 10 bucks a year even if it were more than that
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:33.140]   Because I just want it's one of those I want to give you money to show you how happy I am about the work that you're doing
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:37.700]   But this isn't the sort of oh and if you want to listen to more than three podcasts or
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:41.060]   More than three hours per week. Give us 10 dollars a year
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:45.220]   No, these are actually well considered well considered suite of bonus features
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:47.540]   My favorite one is the ability to
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:53.140]   Not only can you do you have access to a web player so that you can come back from your daily walk
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:58.420]   I can come back from my daily walk halfway through a podcast and then let go back to my computer open up pocket casts
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:02.900]   In a web browser and pick up exactly where I left off because they're all synced together
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:05.300]   but also if I there's a
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:10.900]   I don't know if you are familiar with Andy Zoltzmann. He is funny funny smart comedian who does
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:12.980]   He's been doing like news based comedy
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:16.020]   He was originally the comedy partner of john oliver before
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.660]   And during the time he moved moved to the uk
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:23.780]   I listened to the daily because of you I listened to bugle the bugle right all the time. I love that show
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:30.340]   Yeah, and he used recently named as the permanent new host of the news quiz on the bb on bbc radio
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:34.420]   If if that show is available via podcast, I can't find it
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:36.340]   As note, no, we're on the site
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:40.260]   But what I can do is I can download the audio from the bbc site
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:42.820]   And then if I just simply drag that into the pocket cast window
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:48.820]   Now that will be available to me through all the devices that I've got pocket casts installed on whether it's android whether it's
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:53.700]   I was a nice feature. I like that. Yeah, because yeah, there's so much audio like a
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:58.020]   And does it pick up where you left out? Does it treat it like a podcast? It does exactly
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:01.860]   And I use a lot we were talking a lot about how like when you
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:05.700]   One of the bains of my existence is like senate testimony
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:12.660]   And I feel as if I have time to listen to like four hours of test of testimony. I will do so and but like oh god
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:18.580]   It's the only thing. Oh, I may as well take a three-hour walk because i'm gonna be i'm going to be in miserable pain anyway
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:21.780]   So I may as well listen to this this three three hours of testimony even
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:29.060]   One and a half time spoken up and I can just simply drive it just drag it into that web window and when I go to my phone
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:31.620]   It will be the there available for download just as another podcast
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:37.140]   It's just and that's just one of a few different features that are available for 10 measly 10 bucks a year again
[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:39.540]   the this is somebody who
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:41.860]   You can always you can always tell this that someone who
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:47.540]   A team that wrote an app for their own use and every time they got frustrated with something they fixed it or they added a feature
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:52.580]   Because it just keeps getting better and better and better. Like I said, it's the cast iron skillet of podcasting apps
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:59.140]   I guess bbc's attitude on the news quiz is you should be using our app because you can listen to it in the bbc sounds app
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:06.100]   So they make it available for download and by the way, Andy for this week's news quiz just remember lilac gray
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:11.380]   Fly like great. I'm I'm more interested in the in the discussion about what brooch
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:17.140]   She was brooch. She was worried because she always chooses like you follow. Actually. That's a very pretty brooch
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:20.100]   And I bet it's like 300 years old that it's worth 18 million dollars
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:24.260]   Like yes, also because she was giving giving a a welcome
[01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:29.780]   A thank you address to to service people that this is actually something that was that was given to her
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:34.100]   Like on her for fifth anniversary of joining the women's core and that oh, okay

[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.300]   Jessica rabbit pin on because she's talking about disney
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:48.180]   I don't think she'll be wearing a Jessica rabbit pin, but uh, you never know look at this if queen

[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:08.500]   Is that another person that is the that is the crown is the official crown of state. Oh, okay
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:11.060]   That was prince charles
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.740]   helping her up the stairs there
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:14.740]   Oh wow as she will she

[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:29.940]   That's the house of lords right with social distancing of course. So it's not many lords
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:33.220]   Yeah, just all the people there's there's there's sanda suits
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:37.220]   That's amazing. This is this is why you have royalties for stuff like this
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:40.740]   It's just again black right if they were if they were a black rod action figure
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:44.020]   I'm buying the black rod actually she gonna come in the black rod any minute now or
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:49.460]   No, no, she's she again. She sent she sent out to go across the hall to the house of commons
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:52.100]   As soon as she approaches the door it slammed in her face
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:58.740]   To traditionally to show that hey look you don't have there you go. See there's someone already there waiting to
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:00.900]   They're gonna close the door on her
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:06.980]   Yes, because there she is there she is she doesn't she doesn't have the freedom of the house of the house of the house of commons
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:11.140]   She has to ask for permission so they have to act out this whole stupid thing
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.580]   Yes, because it's as it was about when uh
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:20.100]   Comes from history when the door is closed wait, I gotta turn on the sound is she gonna beg?
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:27.380]   No, she's gonna pound on the door with the oh, yeah, she's planning with the black rod. Yeah, you know that there's actually damage on the door
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:31.140]   There's damage
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:33.140]   Yep, here comes the black rod
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.740]   Yep. Wow used to be in charge. She used to run Wimbledon. I wouldn't mess with her
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:40.100]   She could look so she's with that broad there especially especially with that kid
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:42.820]   I would also cosplay as that that would get respect
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:45.700]   It's funny that they go through this pan of mine, but they still have tape
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:48.820]   Shape on the floor to show you where to walk. Yeah
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:54.180]   But the fun part about this was that this dates back to when like the the king would go would
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:59.140]   Basically go into the house of commons to basically arrest and have these people in prison
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:04.740]   So that's why they slam the door in their face because look you we can we can barricade the door if we want to oh and then here comes the
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.900]   The mace of power wow look at that thing
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:13.380]   Oh my god, the one that you get severely scolded if you decide to pick it up if I had that in valheim, I think I'd be invincible
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.820]   I need that
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:16.980]   Okay, so they're rechargeable or something like
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:20.180]   It's in a loot box
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:23.860]   So there's bores johnson recognizable from his hair
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:29.060]   Uh, so this is uh, this is the few commoners that are going to get to go right just this
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:34.580]   socially distanced house of commons. Wow what this is kind of fun to watch
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:38.260]   The speech itself not that exciting but uh, but so yeah
[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:43.460]   When you're a thousand years old you get you get a bunch of traditions that you're like, okay when I was 18
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:46.420]   I thought this was lame, but now that i'm 40. It's like you appreciate it
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:50.260]   Don't you appreciate a little bit more. That's like I wish I wish I could be black raw just for a day
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:53.060]   Like there's a charity option. Yeah, I'd love that job
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.860]   You spent 70 years getting to the third person in line
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:02.260]   By the way, it looks like it's frozen. No, they're just not moving
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:06.900]   They're just sitting there in silence listening
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:11.540]   Uh, all right mr. Renee ritchie. It's time for your pick of the week
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:15.860]   So I I have two as well just just so that andi is not good. We don't have Alex
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:18.740]   Duality fill it up
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:23.060]   So the first one is omni focus for they've announced it and they're opening it up for testing
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:29.540]   There's a waiting list for test flight for it and so typically excellent, uh omni group
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:36.660]   Uh blog post that just tells you about what their goals and their designs and their their thinking is towards omni focus for and there's links there
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:41.700]   for you to go to and sign up for their test flight waiting list if you want to be part of the
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:47.220]   The feedback loop for omni focus for which i'm sure getting things done nerds all over the planet are already
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:48.660]   eagerly
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:52.660]   Aligning so do you use omni focus? I mean, I love the omni group and I love their stuff
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:56.820]   I just feel like this this particular program is kind of overkill for me
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:02.820]   You know, I don't I so I I look at like message management apps like gym memberships
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:04.660]   Like they're the gym memberships of the app stores
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:08.660]   That there's all the other one you can get but the act of getting it makes you feel better about yourself
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:12.660]   It's not the act of using it. Yeah, like I got a gym membership. My life is better
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:14.980]   I downloaded a management app. My life is better
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:18.660]   Um, and then it's just one more thing to manage but my ideal
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:23.380]   I've told them this before like my ideal would be not things but thing where you can only put one thing in it
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:26.340]   You can't put anything else in I think there's a version of omni focus
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:30.580]   Yeah, we're machine learning removes the stuff that it knows that it knows i'm not gonna do
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:34.100]   So I don't have to feel guilty about it like I wake up and it's just machine learn
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:36.420]   Do we everything it knows i'm gonna procrastinate about yeah
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:43.460]   But they they have yeah, I still have to do that manually like a loser. Yeah, it uses it uses the formal getting things done methodology
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:45.540]   Which is actually an actual thing gt
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:52.020]   So if you understand it and if you it really is about getting your mindset tuned into that thing kind of like pomodoro
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:56.020]   There are there are all kinds of people have different systems that are been published that have been
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:58.740]   That have been seminared out the wazoo
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:06.500]   And yeah, I've seen people who use omni focus like martina never too low but uses a use a tennis racket
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:11.140]   And and it's really really quite impressive also. It's not you I agree
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:13.780]   It's not for me. It's too complicated for what I need to do
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:21.620]   But it's as usual anything with anything with the with the omni with label on it. They are true artisans
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:29.140]   They are they are they are emblematic of the difference between like mac and ios development and windows and android development
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:32.100]   Which is again windows apps are great android apps are great
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:38.820]   But you just don't see it's rare that you see the kind of virtuosity that omni puts into just about every single app that they make
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:40.660]   It's amazing
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:46.660]   And by the way from we'll get to your second pickon just a second but from cramped here in our chatroom Andy
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:52.740]   There is a friday night comedy podcast from bbc radio 4 that includes the news quiz
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:56.180]   I didn't I did not know that okay, are you happy?
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:42:00.820]   I think I think i'm actually subscribed to it. I just don't listen to it every single week. Oh, okay
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:04.180]   Well, there you go
[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:12.740]   I'm sure that Andy's alton's very happy that they prevented me from being simply doing a keyword search on the site and finding it
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:16.820]   That's pretty strange, but thank you crap to be appreciated and now
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:19.380]   Your second pick Renee
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:23.540]   Yeah, so it's a it's a youtube channel called dsl shooter and it's kaleb pikes channel
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:30.500]   And he has just been ingenious over the last year showing different setups that if you just if you want to improve your zoom or your face time
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:35.460]   Or your webex or whatever or you want to be a streamer or you want to go and make youtube videos
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:40.980]   He's got a bunch of these like complete video setups on a desk complete video setups on a poll
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:45.380]   The one today is complete video setup in a briefcase like or like a sorry a pelican case
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:50.740]   So he dies it as cheap as he can he gives you options for lower price stuff for higher price stuff
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:53.380]   Uh, but it's really designed for you to get
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:43:01.060]   High quality video streams at a really really low price. Um, and he's he's just ingenious about how he builds all this stuff tip number one
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:08.020]   Just from my own experience do not buy a 55 inch computer monitor because there's no way you can have a camera
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:14.340]   You know when i'm doing my uh my valheim thing i realize i can't put a kit because if i put it on top of the monitor
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:16.420]   i'll be looking up like that
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:21.380]   So i have it on the side, which is not really good twitch practice i guess but uh
[01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:25.940]   I put the chat room underneath it so i'm looking at the chat room i can look at the camera
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:29.860]   I need to get an arm for my uh mike though. That's a that's a good idea
[01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:35.620]   Yeah, he's using two of those of those friction arms, uh to mount with the setup and it's really good. It looks good
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:37.140]   This looks good
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:41.380]   So there's just tons of videos there if you want one on a stick that's fine like a like a single c stand
[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:44.740]   He's got that setup too, but anything a lot of times people say they don't have the space
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:48.660]   They don't have the room or they need to move it around and he's really good at showing you how to set things up
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.660]   So you can do exactly what you need?
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:53.060]   Uh, I should probably mention
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:59.780]   That I was on office hours. Yes, thursday and i watched it. It was great. Yeah, it was a lot of fun
[01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:05.140]   Uh, we talked about our new club twit with alix lindsey. So that is now up on youtube
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:10.260]   Uh, it is the may 6th, but I think it even says focus on leo loporton club twit
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:15.940]   So you can probably find that fairly and andi and I finally learned your secrets to how you stop us from monologuing
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:18.020]   It was ingenious. Oh did I reveal
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:20.980]   Did I reveal that? Oh
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:25.860]   That's okay. This is this is always a game of measure and counter measure just like subwoofer
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:28.660]   We'll work around it
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:34.660]   Repeat the video desk setup. Uh, it's dslr video shooter is at the name of the channel. Yes
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:37.300]   dslr channel and scalar pike is a
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:38.420]   pike host
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:39.620]   Yeah
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:41.860]   Yeah, I might want to I might want to get a special
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:47.380]   You know now that i'm streaming on twitch i'm really starting to think I should really do something like this get something fancy and
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:49.140]   really, uh
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:53.620]   They want me to they want me to i have an a 10 mini they want me to have a behind the head
[01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:56.500]   Uh wide angle with my go pro
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:01.380]   So that you could you know, I can I can switch back and forth so you can get it behind and see me
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:03.780]   In front of the screen and then they'll then
[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:09.140]   Well, if you have the a to mini leo you need not just an overhead, but you need an over the shoulder shot with a tv set behind you
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:11.140]   That shows sponsor messages. Oh
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:16.740]   Which to drain like the least the last the last i have no sponsors. It's a club twit and it's ad free
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:20.020]   Oops. I just deleted my sponsor message right there
[01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:25.380]   I brought to you by club twit members and members like you
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:32.500]   Uh, if you are not yet a member of club twit that would be a good pick of the week go to you to twit.tv slash club twit
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:36.100]   Uh, the the we thought the premise would simply be
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:40.660]   Uh, you know since ads are getting harder to sell and people don't like to be tracked
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:44.500]   What if we offered an ad free listener supported version of all our shows?
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.900]   So that is the the come on
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:51.540]   All of our shows minus the ads video and audio for every show including this one
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:56.820]   Uh, seven bucks a month, but it turns out the discord has become really a wonderful place
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:46:00.820]   To hang out we do shows in there we stream live we have
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:05.460]   Uh, you know discussions on all kinds of topics and it's a really nice bunch of
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:08.820]   People about 2000 in the discord i think
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:15.780]   Talking about everything from philosophy to photography to space to travel which really probably should be the same category
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:21.780]   Um, and we have a little trivia room. We have a let's play and it's in the let's play that i will play the valheim
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:27.860]   Uh as well. So, uh, that's fun and then there's a final piece to the club twit, which is a
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:33.460]   Uh twit plus feed and we put various things like our untitled linux show
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:37.700]   In uh in that twit plus feed and that's a four members of the club
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:43.220]   So seven bucks a month find out more at twit tv slash club twit. There's my
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:47.700]   Plug for club twit. I wanted to show you and i've unfortunately closed
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:54.500]   History there's a thing called history in your browser that shows you that's not my pick
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.660]   Uh
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:47:02.020]   But I and I don't what if it was what if it were I know I know what is what is the history?
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:04.500]   You know i'm looking here. I don't see uh
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:08.980]   Uh, library preferences. Oh, I know where it is. It's in that special
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:15.380]   There it is history and i'm gonna click today. Oh my god. I've been this is the problem
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:22.180]   I look at so many things here is here is what I wanted to nope. That's not it. That's me buying andes pick of the week
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.780]   Okay
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:25.780]   There it is elago
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:31.540]   So this was something that philip elmer de witt recommended as a fix to the crappy
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:38.260]   Uh remote control for apple tv and I got one for every apple tv in the house and he's absolutely right
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:42.900]   Elago which makes those great little rubber max that you put your apple watch into charge him
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:46.580]   Also makes an Intellicase the elago r1
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:53.380]   For eight bucks designed for the apple tv. This is for the fourth generation apple tv the one with syri
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:57.540]   It's got a little magnet on it. I just love this. I have to just want to give it another plug
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:01.940]   Philip mentioned it comes in colors. You can get pink if you really want to
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:08.420]   Uh, it makes it a lot harder to lose the apple tv because it also has a it comes with a a lanyard
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:10.260]   wrist strap
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:14.500]   So if you don't have any uh, you know, you can't throw the apple tv away. It's great
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:19.300]   I really love this and much as you want to as much as you might want to I have not had to search
[01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:25.700]   For my apple tv in some times. Did you also buy five of the new controllers leo because that would be the pro leo move
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:30.260]   I like the new controller. I have to say but I have not purchased any yet
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:34.500]   I'm fact I thought I would buy I would thought it would be run not walk to buy the apple tv
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:38.820]   And I just don't I can't think of any reason to buy it to be honest with you
[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.420]   You can just buy the controller
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:42.900]   Yeah, the remote is the best reason I guess
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:45.860]   but yeah
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:48.580]   Uh, that is uh mac break weekly for this fine

[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:56.820]   so uh, he will be back
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:58.020]   um
[01:48:58.020 --> 01:48:59.460]   but uh

[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:07.140]   Wasn't too hard was it anti-annoco from tv chph
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:09.140]   Boston we managed to fill the whole show
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:14.820]   Uh, he is uh gonna be on thursday when are you on next uh friday at 1 p.m

[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:32.180]   so we discussed that at our editorial meeting today
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.500]   and uh
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:41.780]   We're we're gonna see if we can do a live twit in the next week or so because i'm i'm two weeks after my last vaccine
[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:44.260]   john's fully vaccinated
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:48.660]   Uh, I think mike elgin is we're thinking maybe we can get a live twit in studio. It's been so long
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:51.860]   Um, it would be so nice to see people
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:50:01.940]   Yes, wouldn't it wouldn't be fun rene richy. Thank you for being here rene's channel on youtube is easy to find youtube.com/rene richy
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:04.340]   What are you talking about this uh today?
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:11.940]   Uh today i'm talking about whether you should get an m1 i'mac or wait for the supposed theoretical
[01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:15.620]   hypothetical m1 x i'mac pro. Well, that's a really good topic
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:20.660]   Wow, I don't know. That's a good one. Well, i'm gonna have to watch
[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:23.860]   Wait or or buy
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:29.300]   These new ones are very pretty. I love the rumor. Well, we're gonna find out june june seventh right?
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:35.220]   We're gonna do a live stream of the apple wwc keynote and I have a feeling that's we just want that 16ish
[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:38.980]   Maco pro leo. I'm that's all I want. I think that's the one i'm gonna get I do
[01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:43.380]   I'm very happy with the power book that I had 13 and chem one power book, but
