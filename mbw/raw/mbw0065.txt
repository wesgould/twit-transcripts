[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, everybody's favorite show
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   about all things iPod, iPhone, and...
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Yes, Macintosh.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I'm Leo LaPorte joining us on the panel today.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Corps.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Hello.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   You probably hate it when people call it the Pixel Corps.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   But that's how it's spelled.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I've gotten used to it after a while.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   So I think it's a cool piece.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Or a Marine Corps or a support.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Yeah, it's the core.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It's a core, man.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And it kind of ties in well with Apple, too,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   if you spell the C-O-R-E.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   It's a...
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Good to see you.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Red Five standing by.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's just like shooting Wumprats back home on Tatooine.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   You didn't do it quite whiny enough, Leo.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I can't say...
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   [ Speaking in German ]
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I wanted to go to Tasha Station and try...
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It's a fabric in theaters.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And a brand new member of the panel joining us, Peter Cohen,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   who has been around for a long time,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   senior editor now at Macworld.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   But you did a whole series of...
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   What was it?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Gaming books?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I'm trying to remember, Peter.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Oh, well, I've been writing about games since about 1994.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   So, yeah.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   No books, though.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Thank God.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   No books?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Why did I think you had a whole bunch of books under your belt?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yeah, thank God would be the right word.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   My publishers...
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I'm talking about games.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   You have time to write books.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I've had dinner with Andy enough to know that there's absolutely no money in it.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Are you covering gaming at Macworld or everything?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Well, I spent about maybe 20% of my time writing about games
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and about 80% of my time writing news for the Macworld.com website.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Then you're perfect.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   You'll actually know something about what we're talking about,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   unlike the rest of us.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We're so glad to have you aboard.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I just know you felt this way about me and the rest of the video.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   No, you're the other expert.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It's the rest of us.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I've had eight episodes of Mythbusters on my Tivo downstairs.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Maybe that's going to be more interesting.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   No, no, no.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's not an insult.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's a joke.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I didn't know you were so thin-skinned, Mr. McNatto.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And now you're mispronouncing my name for comedic effect.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Well, this is going to be a great podcast.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Another red letter day for-- go ahead.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Andy, talk away, Matt. Just go away.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   No, see, now you're-- now, now, that's caling on.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Here we go.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   No, no.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   He's got a Furnish Man coming at any minute now,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   and if the Furnish Man knocks, it's kind of like they're the Ice Man coming.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's only the Furnish Man coming.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   We have to let him go.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   He's here until then.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Alex Lindsay, I didn't mean anything nasty against you either.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'm the one I'm talking about.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I know nothing.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It's fine.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I don't dare.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   It's fine.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Alex, we'll start our own podcast.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Okay?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yeah, I'm going to go somewhere.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Geez, somewhere else.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Light some sage and get rid of some of the bad vibes that somebody here seems to be investing
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   the situation with.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Somebody I--
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   It'll be--
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Used to do that, by the way.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Light the sage and disinfect with the sage.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Did it work?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   No.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Did it cover up the pot smell?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   He was leaving my mind?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   That's what it was all about.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I think that was a lot of people think.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It was a lot of people think.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   They need to cleanse spiritually.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   They're dorm rooms.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So Peter is just back from Finland.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Or Iceland.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Iceland, that is correct.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Not Finland, Iceland.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Not Greenland either, Iceland.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   No.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Iceland.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Iceland's supposed to be the nice part of the Arctic Circle.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Let me tell you something.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   That is a lie.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   When the hail is blowing 80 miles an hour, that's not nice.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   But yeah, no, yeah, I was there actually on business.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I was there covering the Macintosh release of EVE Online, which is a new massively multiplayer
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   online game for the Macintosh.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Oh, yeah, they just announced that.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Indeed, and they just rolled it out today, but they announced it over the weekend.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And it had a fabulous time in Reykjavik, which is an absolutely lovely city.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I just wish I'd managed to bring back a big bottle of Blue Opal, which is one of the local beverages.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Indeed, it's menthol-flavored schnapps, and I really could use it with the colt that I brought back with me too.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Menthol-flavored schnapps.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You can use it as a limit.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It's wonderful.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Or set it on fire.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It probably makes a fine kerosene-like substance.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It makes you feel like you're getting healthier whether you are not.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Let's talk quickly about Leopard.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Just kind of wrap it up.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   We did a full Leopard Show last week, but we had just got, you know, it was pretty new.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Any changes?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Andy, I know you didn't like the transparent menu in the doc.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Yeah, it didn't take long for different developers to write simple applications that do nothing more than, you know, basically put a white background behind the menu bar so that it's no longer translucent.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I think it's going to be...
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Apple should just send a case of beer to one of these people and say, "Look, we're sorry.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Can we just use this?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Thank you."
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   There's a site.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I'm a Treadit.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   LeopardDocs.com that has like all kinds of docs.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Like, you know, you can have grass.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I guess it's just a resource.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You could edit it.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Yeah, and there's a terminal hack for making it opaque again, all that other sort of cool stuff.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I mean, I think that, you know, users have pretty much clearly voted on what they think about both the menu bar and the doc.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   The fact that usually it takes a small amount of time before hacks start appearing for turning something off.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I mean, that's the clearest vote you can possibly collect on this.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Traditionally, Apple has not been, unlike Windows, you know, Windows, there's all these companies that kind of live off on the periphery of making Windows.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Many of them look more like Mac, but making Windows look different.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It is not so, I mean, what happened?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Remember, there used to be a Parents Manager and then there were all those little ways to modify the appearance.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It doesn't seem like people are doing that as much.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Or am I just not in touch with the right people?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I think it's more like they're being more ambitious with stuff like Quicksilver and Growl that, as opposed to getting restyling what's there, adding new controls that you tend to use instead of the old thing.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Right.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And also, I've never been a fan for reskinning.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I think that all I want to say is it's like jumping into a car no longer knowing whether the shift goes left or right anymore.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   That's a good way to wrap something around a phone pole.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   That's not a good thing on a computer either.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I work on too many different computers and so I'm always afraid of customizing too much because I don't want to get used to something I can't find later.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Peter, we haven't talked to you about Leopard.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I think I was probably the most positive last week about Leopard.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I think it's pretty slick.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Let me preface up by saying that I only upgraded the Saturday after it came out.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I've been running it.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I'm really enjoying it so far.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   The only thing that I really dislike is that it's broken some key applications that I need to use and that seems to be the result of Apple waiting until everybody else got Leopard to give developers the GM of the thing which seems to be really bizarre to me.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   What are the programs that you need to use that it doesn't work?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   The key one right now is missing sync for BlackBerry.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   That kills me too.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Plaxo doesn't work right under Leopard.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   There are a few other little knickknacks here and there that are wonky or don't work at all.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Most developers have been pretty quick.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I'm broshed software that's early on top of things with Wiretop Studio and Snap Pro.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I've been seeing a pretty steady stream of update articles about this and that that's being updated for Leopard as time goes on.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Alex, how are the Pro apps doing?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I just got Leopard installed the half- commit and we've been so into production that we haven't tested.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   The word is that almost everything works fine. There's a handful of obscure applications that might be a little coirier.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   We've actually found that some of the applications, ironically, some of the 3D applications we use are actually more stable on Leopard than they were on the previous system.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's a core animation.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   It's not core animation yet because I don't think they're really implementing.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I think we're going to see that roll out over the next couple of weeks, but this is really just for whatever reason some of these applications got a little bit more stable.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   All of our production machines are still, we haven't upgraded them. We're just starting to upgrade this week.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   We wanted to give it a week. I did put it on a Mac Mini that I have at home and I love it, but I haven't done any pro work on it.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   It sounds like our initial conclusions about Leopard are still pretty much the same.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Anything Andy that's bugging you more than it did last week?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Not really. I find that I'm settling into it a lot more than I was a week and a half or two weeks ago.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Mostly I've been bitten so much by the developers of the past month that I realized that a lot of my problems from the August release and the July release and we released before that were coloring my attitude.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Even the transparencies and the user interface I'm starting to get used to.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I've actually warmed a lot to the new slate gray adjustments to the interface, which I thought made it kind of grab, but now I realize it's more THX 1138.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   That it was a couple of years ago. It's a lot of the question of getting used to something that's different as opposed to not liking something that doesn't work as well.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   A lot of attention going around about a bug that was in Tiger and is still in Leopard the copy bug.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   When you move files from a device to another device and you lose the device halfway through the copy, people say that you lose both files so that the ultimate effect is, let's say you're copying to a network drive is if the network drive goes offline in the middle of the copy, you lose both.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Has anybody been bit by that?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I've never actually had that happen. I don't do a lot of moving. I do copying. You move files over network drives all the time, don't you?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Yeah, we move over the network gigabytes or terabytes actually in a given day sometimes.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   We definitely had one lost in the middle of the... We definitely had breaks where we lost the drive.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I can't have a cost data.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   We've actually lost the data. Maybe there is maybe some way that if you have your foot bump in your hand in the right position and that happens, you lose the data, but we haven't had that happen yet.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I think I mostly copied and deleted anyway, but that might be the advice to give right now if you want to avoid this move bug copy and then delete instead of doing a move.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Because that's all a move is a copy and delete.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I guess I wouldn't remove.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I mean, I would always copy a week.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Yeah, that just makes more sense to me. Then you've got two copies. Then when you're sure you've got a copy...
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   This is only happening on a move.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   We've got to hold on to keep the right thing.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Sorry.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Well, you're right. I think you're right. Click, right? And you can get a move.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I didn't even know a move existed. It shouldn't exist as far as I'm...
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   There you go.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   It's absolutely a travesty against nature.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Yeah. It's a user error. It's not...
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   PevCAC probably exists between keyboard and share.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   God created Adam and move, not Adam and move copy.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   We'll get to Adam and Eve a little later on, but...
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Look at my concordance. It's a Leviticus. I know it's Leviticus.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   I guess in our office, a file doesn't exist until it exists in two places.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Yeah. I mean, that's sensible, isn't it?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   However, it is a bug. I mean, it shouldn't do that, but anyway.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Yeah, copy. Don't move.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Other bugs. Some complaints from security folks about the leopard firewall,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   saying that it doesn't do what it's supposed to do, that it, in fact,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   if you block all apps, it doesn't block all apps.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Comments on that. This is from Heiza Security, H-E-I-S-E,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   dashsecurity.co.uk.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Have you read these articles, guys?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   I have to say, the first thing I did when I got leopard is I went to the security
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   preference pane, which is where the settings now live,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   and enabled the firewall. I said, "Block all incoming connections except for these,"
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   which seems like a sensible point of view, but they're saying that doesn't do anything.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Yeah. I mean, every time there's a firewall problem or security problem,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I mean, I've got my own iron shafts that I can solve that do nothing
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   but bang on security on every platform all day long.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   And their consensus remains that the security improvements in leopard are a huge improvement
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   over what was going on in Tiger.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   This new firewall problem that I just read about it yesterday,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   and I haven't been able to find anybody who can either explain it to me in terms that
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   I'm not exactly a newbie, but again, my eyes really start to glaze over when we talk about
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Nat translation and packets.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   There's a little Indian packet switching problem with the headers of this,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and I'm like, "Okay, fine, what's on TV?"
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   It looks like it's not a problem that's a deal breaker for a lot of people,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   but it's the sort of thing where if it's caught early, it'll prevent us from discussing
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   a major security breach sometime next year.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Yeah, good point. Let's pay attention.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And I would suggest, I mean, in the past, you've been able to use, you know,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   took a little more voodoo from the terminal IPFW, which is a very good firewall.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   It comes with BSD.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   But I would suggest probably users go to the security tab and enable the firewall.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   It doesn't come enabled by default, and that's something Microsoft learned from bitter experience
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   is not a good idea.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Of course, if you're using a router, and most people do nowadays,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   you're probably secure no matter what you do.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Yeah, that's just it.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I mean, you know, for the average user in the street who's, you know,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   got a router set up that's providing them with internet access through their DSL line
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   or through their cable modem.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   This is really kind of a non-starter.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   So I'm just trying to bring up the negatives here.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Go ahead, Annie.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   It does.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   But we already established that you're captain negativity in this panel.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I'm a mean man.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Also, the person who developed the Kerbero system is ugly and it speaks things.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Yes.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Yeah, I still think we're waiting for a firewall that does for firewall security.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   What a time machine does for backups, which is a system that everybody's going to use
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   and nobody's going to disable.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Right now, firewalls still have the same problem that they've always had,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   which is they work great until the first time.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   They create a technical support problem at which point you turn it off
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   and you never, never turn it back on again.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   One other thing, one of the thing Apple did, I thought, was very good is when you open
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   something you've downloaded a program, you've downloaded from the internet,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   it tells you you're about to open a program, you downloaded from the internet.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Here's when you downloaded it.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Here's where you downloaded it from.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   You sure you want to do this.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   That by itself might make a big difference for a lot of moms and dads.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Yeah, it also illustrates a really nice new piece of infrastructure in that there's
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   support for some form of application signing.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Right.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   So not only that, but the first time you say, "Hey, maybe, the first time you okay,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   a download from, like, Ambrosia software," it knows that if Ambrosia starts signing
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   that their apps at that point, they know that, "Okay, now we trust anything that comes
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   from this signature."
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Right.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Right.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   That is a very trick piece of code and leopard, and it's something that I've already really
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   tried to make use of.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I like that a lot.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   You know, it might be timely because, of course, there's a Trojan horse floating around in
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   the wild, actually.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I think the first one in the wild I've seen in a while that attacks some Mac machines.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   You have to explicitly download it.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   You have to explicitly say, "Yes," when you open it, you have to give it your administrator
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   password if you're not running as administrator.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   And then it will run and put a key logger on your system.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Yeah, every list that is sort of the key word here is in it now.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Every time there's like an announcement of a new Trojan horse or some piece of nastiness,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   the living embodiment of these Trojan horses is the kid that asks you if you're a lunch
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   money and then winds up hanging by his underpants by a flagpole.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Because the only people that it will work on are people who are just absolute newbies
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   and who is a...
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I mean, this is what happens.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   You go to a porno site.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And I mean, I've seen this a lot.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And you see it a lot on Macs where it says, "Hey, you want to watch this movie, but you can't
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   because you don't have the right codec.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   You need to download."
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And it looks like you're installing a codec.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And of course it says, you know, you need to install this to watch the porn.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   That's very true.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   People will do very stupid things when they're looking for porn.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   So do you think about the Babylon 5 serenity/fic floating around and you'll figure out that
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   porn makes people do silly things?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   You're in a hurry and you might say, "Yes, yes, yes, go right ahead."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   So I think it's probably good to mention that it exists.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   But also it's great that every time I take all those new security features that you'll
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   see in Leopard, it's a case of closing the barn door before the horses get out.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Oh, I like that.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   That's good.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   I like that.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   There you go.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I want a dollar for it, but that's okay.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I mean, every time you see a security breach on Windows, it usually winds up being a problem
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   that's been there since Windows 95, but hasn't been patched or has been patched, but not been
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   downloaded.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Every time you see all the new security enhancements, you see a problem that could conceivably be
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   bad if it were properly exploited and if this other thing weren't sealed off.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Well, you know, it's clever.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   It changes your DNS so that when you go to, is for phishing, I guess, when you go to eBay
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   or PayPal, for instance, the DNS server that you're using instead of your, you wouldn't,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I think most people wouldn't notice this.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   The DNS server works normally until, you know, it goes to a site that whoever's running
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   this DNS server wants to fish you on and then it isn't really PayPal, even though it says
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   PayPal in your browser.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And if you try to put your DNS settings back to normal, it's got a cron job that automatically
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   resets it.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It's a clever, it's a clever little hack.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It better be really good porn.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   I mean, I would be really upset if it were just playboy videos from 1981.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   It's on several sites, apparently.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   I think this is the kind of thing that if people, probably is that Mac users have been complacent
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   for so long and we've just kind of said, yeah, well, we don't have to worry about this stuff.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   So it's probably a good thing to say, hey, you do.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   You should be sensible.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I think that's what Leppard's doing is saying, hey, you downloaded this from somewhere.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Be sure you want to install this.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   You know, there's always this sort of, there's this process that happens every time one of
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   these things gets mentioned.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And that is that the aluminum foil hat wearing crowd all of a sudden comes out with.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Oh, no, it's even worse.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   It's even worse.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Well, Intego was the ones who were the ones who first found this, so they must have developed
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   it in order to sell their own product.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   I mean, talk about just a completely ludicrous paranoia in this case.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   I don't think it's not.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   It's not like they're a phone company.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   They wouldn't do that.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.800]   Hey, speaking of phones, you think the Google phone or at least the Google phone OS is a
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.000]   challenge to the iPhone have people been following that one?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Yes.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Yes and no.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.120]   It looks like it's going to be revolutionary and it's going to change the table in a major
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.920]   way, but not in the same way that the iPhone has.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:54.480]   The iPhone was a brand new device with features and an entirely new approach that a user immediately
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.600]   has, you know, will immediately improve the life of the average user.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.040]   For now, and I've only talked to a few people about it yet and I'm still waiting for a
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.680]   whole list of questions to be answered by people who know what they're talking about.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.000]   But for now, it looks like it's more like the way that the internal combustion engine
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.400]   was revolutionary in that it will really affect the way people build cars and things like
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400]   that.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.960]   It may or may not deliver features that the user actually appreciates.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   The phone that you buy that has this Android platform that's actually called Android, not
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.720]   Google phone.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.920]   The phones that are running Android may not look any different from the nice looking media
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.120]   phones that you can get from Samsung and from Sony and those other people.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.720]   It's just that they'll be running an operating system that any phone maker can license for
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.400]   a license and install that any developer can support and have really, really intimate
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.240]   access to all the features of the phone.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.640]   Something that I found really interesting for good reasons and bad reasons is the fact
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.480]   that applications can ask the phone where the phone is.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.040]   So for instance, if you're in the middle of the street, if you activate a certain piece
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.360]   of software, let's say, it can tell you that, oh, you know, there are three people from your
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.120]   address book that you've identified as close friends, there are three people within four
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   blocks of you.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.560]   Do you want me to tell you where they are and maybe you can meet up and get coffee or
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.360]   something, which is creepy on some level, but which is interesting on another level.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.520]   That's what JaiKU does and one of the things I actually like about JaiKU.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.520]   Exactly.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.920]   Especially if it's a feature you can turn on and turn off.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.640]   What makes it interesting and this is one of the big things that I'm really trying to
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:36.440]   look into is what is the user terms of service going to be on this device.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.120]   Because Google is developing this operating system the same way they develop all the other
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.200]   really cool things that they give away to people in that it's free, free, free and it's
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.480]   wonderful for the user, but they're in the business of targeted advertising.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.560]   Do they now have the ability to say, okay, well, Andy, it's a Wednesday and Andy is usually
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.680]   near this comic shop in Waltham.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.640]   So I'm going to start looking, I'm going to start targeting ads to the Waltham movie
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.000]   street area that'll steer them towards the people special at the place.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.280]   I think that's actually Google's point, location based advertising.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.720]   That's where they really see some money.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.520]   They've even made some statements to that effect in the past.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.080]   Yeah, but, okay, let's bring this conversation back to porn.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.080]   Aren't you?
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   Thank you.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.720]   Fine, finally.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.560]   Isn't it a little bit uncomfortable when you get that little ad at the top of the screen
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:29.760]   that says, hey, looking for singles on, you know, Brayport Avenue in Dettum, Massachusetts?
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   I'm on Braypoint Avenue.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   Damn it.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.760]   No.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   It's not me.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   It's not me.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   It's not me.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.320]   I just had a furnace guy in.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.640]   He must have used the computer.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.640]   Look forward.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:48.200]   It's just like, you know, those of us who like those location based services, I think
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.720]   again, I don't mind someone telling me that, oh, by the way, you know, you all, I also
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.000]   know that you like diners.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.480]   Believe it or not, there's a 50% off coupon for this diner.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.840]   Yeah, that's good, right?
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.160]   As long as they have the ability to turn that off, as long as the ability to say, no, do
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.760]   not tell any application where I am or what my habits are.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.600]   Also I'm just worried about what happens to this big wobbly stinky pool of information
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.320]   that Google is collecting about me.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:17.880]   Now I don't want to be a tin foil hat person, but there is a really big difference in the
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.440]   level of sophistication of the data that can collect from me when I'm sitting at my computer
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.680]   versus where I'm anywhere in the world with my cell phone with me.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:34.160]   My main problem that is that, you know, when I go to sites like Amazon.com that use my
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.360]   past experience as an indication or my past traffic as an indication of what I'm looking
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.520]   for at that particular point, it inevitably fails.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.040]   You know, I use the recommendation, engineering.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.040]   Right, exactly.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.440]   You know, I end up using Amazon and many times to purchase things for other people that I
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.440]   myself have absolutely no interest in.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.920]   So, you know, all of a sudden every time I go to Amazon.com it comes up with, you know,
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.320]   lifts of exotic duct tape, care bearers and pet shop voice compilation.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.680]   Sometimes I think you're gay.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   That's the problem.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:13.360]   Well, so does everybody else.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   So does everybody else.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.320]   Leo, that's not really a big stretch for Amazon.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:23.000]   You know, my point remains that, you know, depending on how exactly the data is coming
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.240]   through, it may very well be useful to some people and not very useful to correct many
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.240]   of us.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   Right.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.240]   Right.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   Well, see what happens.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.760]   And I only bring it up really in reference to the iPhone and you made the most important
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.240]   point, Andy, which is it's not hardware.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.480]   It's just an operating system.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.200]   Well, it's not hardware yet.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   I think is the key.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.280]   Well, no, it's not hardware period because every single hardware manufacturer is not
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   actually you can think of.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.120]   I mean, Samsung, Motorola, HTC, everybody's in the business of manufacturing handsets
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.400]   is signed on to this, meaning that they'll have Android based phones available.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.960]   Another one of those coins that's in the air is whether there will be a hardware user
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   interface specification like on a Windows mobile device, part of the hardware specification
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.080]   is that you have to have a back button, you have to have a phone button, a home button,
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.160]   and you have to have some sort of a pointing system built into the device.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.440]   I'm curious to see whether this universal operating system is going to be limited to
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:25.640]   just like a trio form factor or just an iPhone like form factor or whether they're going
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:31.240]   to be different flavors of applications that will depend on what sort of device that you're
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.280]   working on.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:41.000]   I'm still waiting for the Google phone shuffle, you know, that we're promised from Apple a
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   while ago.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   It has one button that randomly gets somebody or somebody that's a random friend.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.400]   And I think that as it relates to, excuse me, I think as it relates to the iPhone, I don't
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.000]   think it really affects the iPhone sales that much because if I wanted a cheaper computer
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.960]   that was more open, I'd buy a PC.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:02.120]   If I wanted to have a cheaper iPod or an MP3 player, I'd buy a thousand of them.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.040]   People buy Mac products and Apple products because they want it to be integrated and
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.520]   designed and they want everything to kind of fit together.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.200]   Now they complain about that too, that it's not open enough and everything else.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.960]   I think what's great about the phone is that it'll probably push Apple to probably accelerate,
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.920]   you know, I think it could push Apple to accelerate opening up the iPhone a little bit.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.560]   I think it puts an enormous amount of pressure on other systems, you know, because it will
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.720]   be much more wide open in that sense.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.760]   And so I think it's a great thing for the industry.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.880]   I think it's a good thing for all of us.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.160]   But I don't think that I don't think Apple's iPhone sales will be affected dramatically.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.120]   That's also an interesting question that if you look at the press releases and you look
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.080]   at the website that all the stuff is posted on, you see the word open is used in like
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:52.520]   every other sentence, but you don't know whether they mean it in the literal sense of software
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:58.160]   code base that a manufacturer can download, modify it to their heart's content, and then
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.320]   turn it into whatever they want to turn it into, or whether they mean it in the vague
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.080]   sense of giving people more power than they're used to.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.600]   One of the really cool things that could be done with any phone other than the iPhone
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.960]   would be to put Skype on it.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:15.160]   And basically you have IP phone on applications on every single handset.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.800]   The question is though, will T-Mobile still allow its own handsets to run a Skype program?
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.840]   Or will they be able to lock out certain features like Verizon does?
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.360]   Historically has done whenever there are built-in features to a handset that compete with its
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   subscription services.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.440]   Yeah, I'd be shocked if any of these companies allow people to do that kind of stuff.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.120]   I mean, it's there, there, there's some monopolistic.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.600]   I think we're a long way off from an open cell phone.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.080]   I think the issue is that it's not all of them, but what happens when one of them breaks
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.560]   rank, you know, and that's the, and more importantly, what happens if Google figures
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.240]   out how all this stuff works and how to make it work really, really well.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.400]   I mean, they're used to kind of open research, let all these phone companies play with it,
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.600]   let them all figure it out, and then bring out something that solves that problem using
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.000]   only Wi-Fi or using, you know, another system.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.400]   Well, let's not start on the open cell system.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:11.120]   Let's not forget that Google is demanding that anybody who signs up for Android pledges
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:19.440]   not to fragment what they're doing in any way as well, so everybody's got to be working
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.240]   on a unified platform.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.640]   So I don't really see that as a big issue.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:31.760]   Another interesting thing that kind of came out of Android today was a query from somebody
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.080]   to Symbian CEO, Nigel Clifford.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.760]   And they said, "So what do you think of Android?"
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.960]   And he basically said, "Well, my reaction is, hey, it's yet another Linux platform."
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.520]   You know, there may be 10, 15, 20, 25 different Linux platforms out there.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:52.240]   It sometimes appears that Linux is fragmenting faster than it unifies.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:59.000]   So while Google itself was insisting that people who want to develop their own Android-based
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   phones, signing on fragmentation pledge, Android itself is kind of a Linux fragmentation in
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   a way.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.600]   I see that new iTunes and I and QuickTime are out today.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.240]   And of course, when a new iTunes comes out, the first thing anybody does is go, well,
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:19.120]   not everybody, but most of us do is go look at the resource strings.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.280]   And I mean, why not, right?
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.280]   Apparently, Google--
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.280]   The device is hovercar.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.280]   That's the coolest.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.680]   Go to the Gizmodo.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   There are.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:36.720]   There are some interesting strings in there that might presage some eye disc or disc usage
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.760]   of the iPhone, which is something that's much missed.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.200]   I don't know why Apple would go back and start doing that all of a sudden, but that would
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   be nice.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.000]   Although there are actually third-party utilities for doing that.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.080]   Of course, the problem is it doesn't load up a standard USB driver.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.720]   You still have to have this desktop software to do it.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:59.560]   And also, again, I have written an entire book on cramming that 8 gigabytes for the storage
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.840]   full of everything that you've got.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.960]   My usual idea is that if I've got one gigabyte left on there for documents, I'm just not
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.360]   trying hard enough.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.440]   I can buy a key drive for 20 bucks.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.280]   And I'd rather have the files on a key drive than not have three more episodes of the office
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.640]   on my iPhone.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.400]   Anything else new and interesting in the iTunes or is just a bug release fix or is it maybe
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.480]   just an update to the copy protection?
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.560]   I think the word is also that there's a little bit of the constant battle with ringtones.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.560]   Is that...
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.560]   Oh boy.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560]   Is it...
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:41.280]   Is it
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.280]   your update?
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.120]   Of course, there's going to be a firmware update when the UK and European phones come
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   out.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   One, one, two.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.920]   And it sounds like in least in the UK, unlimited really is unlimited.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:56.440]   Again, they've taken that 200 megabyte limit off.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.920]   I think they know what I said.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.080]   You're talking about data transfer?
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.080]   What a limited...
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   Yeah, data transfer.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.040]   So there was this issue, of course, that unlimited wasn't really unlimited in the UK.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.840]   It was going to be like 200 megabytes of data transfer.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.200]   And then the people got kind of confused because unlimited...
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   They thought, man, unlimited.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.920]   And now it does.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.200]   It actually does.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   What a surprise.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.200]   It's crazy.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   Our show notes guys, Shash, who's been doing a great job last couple of weeks on show notes,
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:35.000]   sent me a link to appletell.com where apparently Apple tell writer Michael Mestretta looking
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.840]   at Apple Canada's site found...
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:44.920]   I don't know if it's Saturday, November 10th, a iPhone workshop getting started.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.960]   Do you think that Canada will get an iPhone on the 9th?
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   Or is it just...
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.280]   I think it's just a slip of the lip.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.760]   They probably had the US schedule and just accidentally pasted it in.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.760]   You feel like they've got it.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.480]   We've got to do it in Canada soon.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   They got to do it soon.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.480]   Why wouldn't you not do it?
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   I got other not-
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.480]   I got other not-
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.520]   You had to buy an unlocked one and come back.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.520]   That's true.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.960]   They probably have less of a motivation though because Canadians will probably want to drive
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.280]   down to the United States, take advantage of the exchange rate and buy them cheaper
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   here.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.440]   I know they're cheaper here.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.600]   Amazing.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.680]   The Looney.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.520]   Great story on the CNET UK.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:31.160]   Apple tablet PC says Asus, Asus who makes the Mac notebooks for the moment after making
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   that leave.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.160]   Maybe not anymore.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.600]   Apple's been known not to handle that kind of stuff very well.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:42.680]   Yeah, Asus says that an Apple tablet is going to be out.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   I don't know when.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.200]   I don't know what it'll look like.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.360]   Of course, there are third party manufacturers that will turn your MacBook into a tablet.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   That's...
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   I don't know.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.720]   If that rumor came from Paris Hilton.com, I might find it harder to believe.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.560]   But has there ever in the history of Apple, has there ever been a leak of that magnitude
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.800]   from a company that owes so much of its fortunes to Apple?
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.760]   Seems like a double thing to do, doesn't it?
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.320]   I'm inclined not to believe it just on that basis alone.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:15.160]   Things can leak out a week, maybe two weeks beforehand because enough people are in on
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.760]   the secret at that point.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:23.440]   Enough control has been lost that it's possible for the new iPod Nano photos to get released.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:30.400]   But I just don't believe that an item that's as hush-hush as a Mac tablet would possibly
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.200]   get that kind of a leak this early.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.960]   There's no byline on this article, so I can't tell you who to blame or to call it.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   Sinceenets crave, they say they check back with a source of Asus on a different day.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.240]   They confirmed the Apple tablet will not be based on existing Asus designs.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   It will come from a completely new blueprint based on Intel Core, a tweaked version of
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.120]   Leopard with multi-touch cover flow.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.520]   Wouldn't it be nice?
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   Sounds great.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   Not too good to be true.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.920]   I'll enjoy it while I'm writing my unicorn.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.920]   But as far as this story, but I mean...
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.560]   When you look at the story, what is Apple?
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.560]   What is going to be the next big thing?
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.400]   I mean, they've got to have something for Macworld.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.640]   So I mean, we already updated.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.720]   They revved the Macbooks without any notice at all.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.160]   All of a sudden, they put Santa Rosa in there.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.920]   So they've done that quietly.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.600]   They'll probably see some kind of eye-life upgrade.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.600]   I mean, that's bad.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.080]   Well, we just put it out three months ago.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.720]   What could they update?
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.360]   It's got to be...
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.680]   They've already done a new iMac in the last couple of months.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.680]   Updated the MacBooks.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.800]   They could do something with the MacBook Pros.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.000]   They could release what new iPads?
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   I don't think so.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   But all of this is incremental and usually Apple wouldn't normally do just something
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.320]   incremental for Macworld.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   Let's see.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   That's a tablet.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.880]   Well, that also could be a sub notebook.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.280]   It could be a flash base sub notebook.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.680]   We're channeling Merlin Man right now.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.960]   Aces does a really nice flash notebook.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.240]   I don't know if anybody's played with the triple E.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.640]   Two pounds flash-based.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.680]   I heard that these things are so tiny that Newegg was accidentally sending out complete
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.480]   cartons of the people who had just ordered one.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.120]   I know way much.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.840]   They're run Linux, although apparently they can run XP, I suppose, with some slight modifications
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.680]   they might be able to run OS X.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.960]   But of course, Apple would design something completely of its own kind.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.120]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.240]   But I mean, I love it too.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.080]   Would you love it two pound MacBook?
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   No.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   No.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.800]   No, absolutely not.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.040]   I'm a 17-inch MacBook Pro user.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.440]   This thing replaces 17-inch powerbook.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:49.520]   I tell you what, if Apple made a 60-inch MacBook Pro with a steady camera that I could just
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.880]   wear all the time, that's what I would get.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.880]   That's what he was.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.760]   I'm a hole in a box and you can walk around and be the TV.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:02.080]   I just want to be wearing a football helmet like strapped to a MacBook Pro core basically.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.880]   I just want to be living in my Mac all the time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.880]   Oh, there you go.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880]   I find myself using the...
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   I'll pick me up with the humans, Peter.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   No.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.120]   I find them, they treat me a lot more seriously when I don't have four micro-flop processors
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.680]   attached to my head at all.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.680]   I don't know.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.120]   I like living in the Matrix, Andy.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.120]   That's just me.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.120]   Has anybody experienced the iMac?
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.440]   That's just the first movie.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.920]   Just the first movie, right?
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.720]   Has anybody experienced the iMac freezing issue?
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   I haven't.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720]   I have a new iMac.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   I hadn't had a problem, but there is...
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.320]   Yeah, that's sort of a recurring problem on my iMac.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.320]   It is.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.680]   Did you download the update?
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:41.760]   I downloaded the update too soon to find out whether or not it fixed it or not because
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.600]   my problem has always been very consistent with the way that it's been described that
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.960]   if you're using an application that really throttles the video driver, for me it was
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.960]   aperture.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.800]   I could pretty much count that if aperture were an active thing on the desktop.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:00.160]   At some point within two or three days, I could sense through my psychic powers that
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.480]   the iMac was still up and running, but the screen was just not updating.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.720]   I could see the mouse pointer moving.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:11.360]   I could hear if I'm command-tabbing between applications that mouse clicks and key presses
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.920]   of being directed to new applications.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.920]   But otherwise, it's like, "Oh, great.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.280]   I'm gonna have to double shut down."
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.840]   So that I actually attached a shutdown script to a key function.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.480]   So that was a big "months of all" in this.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.640]   What was otherwise a really, really nice machine?
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.800]   I hope it's fixed for you.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   I hadn't had that problem.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.600]   Maybe it's a cooling issue.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   Unknown.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.400]   Again, supposedly was related to the new graphics driver that they put into this one.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.160]   And it's one of those frustrating things where you can have someone who's been using this
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.200]   machine for months and months and months and it will be completely a non-issue for them.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.840]   And then you'll have a user like me for whom it renders it not inoperative, but as a sort
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:54.800]   of thing where I will almost, I almost booted into this special aperture mode and then shut
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.720]   down right away and then quit aperture when I know I'm not gonna be using it.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.000]   I was using Lightroom, didn't have the problem, but let us know if the patch fixes it next
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   week.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Is this something to do with?
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Is something to do with?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   I might be OpenGL.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   That's it.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   It's certainly an OpenGL driver, right?
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.160]   Because I have a beta software that I'm not gonna name right now that I was testing.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:19.760]   And in my MacBook Pro, I was actually speaking and showing little bits of it.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.520]   And my MacBook Pro not only froze up, I mean, it froze and then it turned my entire monitor
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.640]   into what looked like basically like a postage stamp, or like the Post's, you know, or like
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.160]   a ISBN number, you know, the little design that they have there.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.160]   It was impressive.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.160]   A barcode, you mean?
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   Yeah, like a barcode.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.160]   It was just like this.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.280]   You know, it's slowly and what was great was it didn't do it immediately.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.040]   It just, this is like last week, like three or four days ago.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.960]   It actually faded into that.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.560]   My monitor just slowly faded away.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.080]   So there is some open holes somewhere in the OpenGL stuff.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.960]   I didn't even know you could find that on a Mac.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.960]   So it was very exciting.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.600]   Well, maybe that patch will fix it.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.760]   Woz has been really outspoken about jobs.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:03.480]   I actually asked Steve to join us on the show today and he's in Korea and it wouldn't have
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.600]   worked out, but we will have him on a show in the near future.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.680]   So I won't say too much about this, but did you see the autograph?
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.280]   He autographed somebody's fake Steve Jobs book and the autograph said, I like this fake
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:21.520]   Steve Jobs, but it's a real one, which is interesting for Woz because he's in the past
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.920]   been very cautious about saying anything about Steve Jobs, even though there's things
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.520]   he could say.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.520]   So we'll get him on.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.440]   We'll see what he has to say about that.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.600]   I just want to know what the whole thing with Kathy Griffin is.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   That just weirds me out.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:39.400]   I don't know if I will have the connace to ask that, but I'll tell you what, Peter,
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.160]   we'll get you on and you can ask.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.840]   So are you really sleeping with her?
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.840]   You know what?
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   We'll be auditioning for the open slot here in Map Break Weekly.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.120]   So get those demo tapes in for you to press.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.440]   Woz, though, the great thing about Steve is he's just at face value and he answered you.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.280]   You know, he'd say, oh, I really like her or whatever.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.520]   You know, he'd say something.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.520]   Great.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.120]   Then my next question would be, so what's it like?
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   Okay.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   That's a little too much information.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   So you might.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.960]   Oh, really want to know that.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   Let's see.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   Any other stories?
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   You know, it's kind of a light week this week.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.080]   We'll get to our picks if nobody has any other stories.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.880]   Nothing going once, going twice.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.840]   We do have an audible ad though, I want to say.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:26.240]   In fact, Andy, if you've got an audible book, Speak Up Audible, of course, is back and we're
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.400]   so glad to have them there.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.800]   The audio book source, I use them all the time.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.480]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:37.560]   And if you go to audible.com/macbreak, you can sign up and get a credit for a free book
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.600]   as part of the deal.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.960]   And we like to pick books for you to listen to.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.400]   We've always had some great recommendations.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.280]   Anything you want to recommend this week?
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   Yes.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.520]   There is a book that I finally bought about two or three weeks ago that I'm halfway through.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:42:00.160]   I'm thrilled that in my furious searching for this book, An Audible, in the eight seconds
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.080]   I realized that you're going to be asking for a pick, thrilled to find out that they
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:09.680]   have a book called, a new biography of Houdini, The Secret Life of Houdini, The Making of
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.440]   America's First Superhero.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.240]   Wow, that sounds good.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.240]   That's the same color.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   And Larry Sloman.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:20.400]   It is certainly the most significant new biography of one of the most, America's most
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.280]   fascinating people.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:27.960]   There hasn't been much movement on this in this area of biography in the past 10 or 20
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.960]   years.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.520]   Two people who have done meticulous research into the life of Houdini.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:39.640]   So not only is it a really interesting read, it really paints an incredible picture that
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.520]   tries to get at what made this guy tick.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:48.000]   It also seems to have turned up some really incredible new evidence suggesting that Houdini
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.560]   was actually a secret agent.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   Now come on.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.560]   Really?
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.560]   International super spy.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.560]   Well, you maybe don't want to go that far.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:04.120]   However, it turns out that he was very, very close friends with a person in a Scotland
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:08.880]   yard who was secretly the head of essentially the British Secret Intelligence.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:15.000]   And they built a timeline of where Houdini was traveling at certain times, where other
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.520]   people in the spy biz were traveling at Secret Times.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:25.080]   They noticed that a lot of his travels tended to coincide with different operations that
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.400]   different intelligence agencies had going.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.760]   For instance, he's one of the few people who had made a very, very huge tour of Russia.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.320]   Not only that, but also he tends to.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.800]   He's the guy that the police services would invite in.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.440]   Here's our absolute super top secret facility.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.440]   Let me show you.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.440]   Sure.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   Why not?
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   See if you can break in.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   Have a look at our locks.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.800]   So it's not like he was James Bond, but it really, they really do make a convincing case
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:57.840]   that he had a certain level of intimacy with the spy trade.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:01.480]   And just it's the, but more than anything else, it's a fascinating story.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.520]   And the title really has it down right.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.480]   I really never thought of Houdini as a superhero, but when you think of the way he lived his
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.600]   life, the way that he approached challenges and the adventures that he had in his life,
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.320]   if he wrote him as a comic book character, he would be outselling not Batman, but the
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.320]   Green Lantern definitely.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   All right.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.200]   So it's a life of Houdini, the making of America's first superhero.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.200]   It is on Audible.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   Of course, it's a course.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.320]   They've got 35, actually 45,000 now books on Audible.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.400]   And this one's a narrated by Adam Gruper, six hours and 13 minutes.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.800]   And it can be your book.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.560]   Absolutely free if you go to audible.com/macbreak works on all iPods and iPhones, but actually
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.920]   the device center has hundreds of literally of devices it'll work on, including your
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.040]   computer and you can even burn them to CD.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.880]   I'll tell you, I love audible books and I know you will too.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.640]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.960]   We thank audible for their support of Mac Break weekly.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:03.440]   Couple of stories I did forget and Shash is reminding me that Quicksilver has gone open
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   source.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.680]   In fact, Quicksilver's site has been down.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.040]   I would keep trying to get a leopard upgrade to Quicksilver and it's been down.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:17.560]   I think Alcor is just finally had it and is going to let other people work on Quicksilver.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.560]   Any thoughts on that?
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.560]   Anybody?
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:23.800]   You know who was a big, who was a friend of Alcor's is Merlin.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:29.160]   I wish we get Merlin on this damn baby thing has got to stop.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   I'm coming up.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   Oh yeah.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.160]   When are you?
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.160]   You're due soon, huh?
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.160]   Any day.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.160]   Any day.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.160]   Now.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.160]   Are you going to pull a Merlin on us and disappear?
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.160]   No.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.960]   Carly, let you keep doing the show.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   You might hear a little baby in the background at some point in time.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.360]   It's funny we did.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.760]   So many people have babies now on Twitch.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.560]   Somebody had a baby in the background.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   Oh, Scoble.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.360]   Robert Scoble has got a baby.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.360]   No, but that's actually why.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.360]   Go ahead.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.160]   You're doing it because of Robert Scoble?
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.160]   No, no.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:05.960]   No, I'm saying that, but it pushed me to move technology forward.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.400]   That's why I got the new Mac mini that we're using now is for ripping me.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:17.480]   My wife's entire, her entire, you know, CD library so that she has it all on an iPod
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.920]   so that she can, when we're at the hospital, she has whatever she needs.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   Excellent.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.280]   So, you know, it was, you know, I didn't realize, and this has probably been there forever.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:33.480]   I didn't realize that the iTunes had a burn and burn and eject.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.480]   If you go into the process.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.520]   It's not exactly how I'd recommend having a baby, but it is a pretty good description
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.800]   of how it feels, I think.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.960]   I told, but I could be wrong.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.440]   I was only spectator.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.440]   No.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.280]   So when you put these, when you went through the CDs.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.280]   I miss it.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.040]   So, no, if you, so what happened is you put this burn and eject in.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.080]   It's just a setting that was going through to set the stuff up.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.640]   And maybe it's been there for a long time.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.760]   I just didn't notice it, but you set the setting and you just literally just throw in
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.560]   CDs in there and they just pop out as soon as they're done and you put another one in
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.560]   and they pop out and you're trying to move through a library quickly.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.040]   It's a very, very fast way to do it.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.480]   So it was just a convenient little trick that I didn't know existed.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.720]   Maybe somebody listening doesn't know what exists.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.040]   It's very apt, very, very apt.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.520]   My three kids are 12, 10 and seven.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.560]   And at this point, I wish I could burn and eject them.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.080]   I know how you feel, Peter.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:28.040]   I've got a 13 and a 15 year old and it's every day I drive up to the bus stop and I eject
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:31.480]   them as rapidly as possible.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.120]   But we shouldn't say that because we don't want to poison Alex's mind.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.040]   He's got at least 10 years of goodness and light ahead of him.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.800]   Well, you know, I have two older kids.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   Oh, yeah, you know.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   What am I saying?
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   You know.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.840]   They're pretty, they're amazingly frighteningly.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.840]   You're sweet kids.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.840]   Okay.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.600]   I'm not sure exactly what's going on there.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.440]   I don't know what my ex is feeding them, but they're not old enough yet.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.440]   Give them time.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.880]   Other than telling me that I need to upgrade the computers or something that's about, you
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.040]   know, that's about the only annoyance I get.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.720]   Has anybody been able to get on the Quicksilver site to download an update?
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.800]   Because that's driving me crazy.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   It's down.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   It's down, it's down, it's down.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   Apparently there was something wrong with the update mechanism and when Leopard came
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.000]   out, it really messed things up and now the site is unresponsive.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.920]   You know, that's not the first major site or major server that I've heard about where
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.720]   this magically as soon as Leopard came out, I started getting all kinds of Twitters and
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:28.200]   all kinds of different postings say, guys, I'm sorry, but we don't understand why a server
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.200]   is down.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.200]   We got a guy working on it.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.800]   I can't imagine that's all unrelated.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.800]   Oh, that's weird.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.400]   Well, he was something in the update code.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.760]   Anyway, I'm glad he's open sourced it.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.680]   I think, you know, he's working at Google.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.960]   It'll be on Google code soon if it's not already.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.120]   And that's good news.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:50.000]   I mean, Quicksilver is probably this, the single, maybe arguably the single most amazingly
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.200]   useful Mac program there is.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.000]   So couldn't go, couldn't go wrong.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.040]   I have it open sourced.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:03.600]   Let me plug in my latest great joy phase for the iPod.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.000]   This just came out today.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.840]   And if you noticed when iTunes 7.5 dropped, they mentioned that support had been added
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.800]   for this new interactive music game for the iPod.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.800]   This is it.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.240]   It is really, really cool.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.720]   The developer is harmonics.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:24.560]   If that name sounds familiar, it's because they're the same company that created the
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.600]   enormously popular guitar hero franchise.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.920]   Amplitude frequency, those games are all harmonics games.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.120]   And this is much the same sort of style of games.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.920]   So if you can imagine guitar hero on your iPod, that is phase.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.920]   It is really cool.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.560]   If when you install iTunes 7.5, it actually creates a new playlist in your playlist.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.040]   It's called phase music.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:53.760]   And if you drag your music in there and buy phase from the iTunes store for $4.99, download
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.160]   it and sync all that stuff to your iPod.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:02.200]   This works with 5th Gen, you know, the video iPods, iPod Classics and 3rd Gen or video
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.440]   capable iPod Nanos.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:10.840]   The game is it's an interactive music game that lets you match the beats that are on
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:16.040]   the screen as they descend through these three little tracks that are coming down.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.400]   It is so much fun.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.720]   It's a click wheel burner though.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.120]   It's absolutely a click wheel burner.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.400]   And it's also a slider too.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.800]   You're not just hitting buttons on the wheel, but you're also sliding with a click, click
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.720]   wheel to sort of follow these little sliding things.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.760]   And there are bonus multipliers and things that you have to grab.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.800]   And it's just it's an incredibly cool game.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.760]   I'm having so much fun with it.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.560]   It's the first iPod game that is just totally not even just lifted my skirt, but blown it
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.560]   completely off.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.520]   I am really, really beside myself with this game.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.120]   Clicking buy game right now, Peter.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.120]   I can't wait.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.120]   Absolutely.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:55.400]   I don't wear pants when I'm podcasting, but there's absolutely no point whatsoever when
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.960]   I'm playing face.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   That's great.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   I love guitar hero.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:05.240]   And I, you know, finally a game that fits the iPod interface, which is fantastic.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.560]   Now this would be a good one on the iPhone too.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.240]   Unfortunately, iPhone doesn't play games yet.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   Someday.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.320]   Actually, there is a really cool third.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:19.280]   This isn't my pick, but there's a really cool third party game called Tap Tap Revolution.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.280]   Yes.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.280]   Yes.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.280]   That's exactly like that.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   I guess it is.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.280]   You're right.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.280]   Come to think of it.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.280]   So there is an iPhone game.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.280]   All right.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.600]   So that Peter has started us off with the picks and his pick is phase 4.99 from the iTunes
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.120]   store via MTV networks.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.680]   How about before we move on Eve online?
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.000]   You think this is going to be a good game on the Mac?
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.360]   I mean, Eve online is the kind of game that you have to play on a computer and up until
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.680]   now, Mac users have been relegated to running it on a boot camp.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:52.400]   I understand that maybe one in 100 is trying to get it working across over parallels or
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.840]   VMware Fusion with varying degrees of success.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:59.240]   But those of us who aren't completely insane, we're running it on a boot camp.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.440]   And this makes the game run natively.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:08.360]   If you've got an Intel-based Mac, they're using CIDR, the same technology that electronic
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.280]   arts use to bring its six games to the Mac.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.280]   And it runs beautifully.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.600]   I've been running it on my MacBook Pro since, I think, Friday of last week.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:24.920]   And it looks exactly like it's PC counterpart.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.760]   There are a few things to know going forward, like the expansion pack that's coming out
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.040]   called Trinity is going to have a completely new graphics engine.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:38.320]   And that will not work on the Mac or on the Linux versions right away.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.040]   That's something that's going to be coming sometime in the first quarter of 2008.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.200]   But really, that's inside baseball.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:51.320]   The bottom line is this is a massively multiplayer online game that is absolutely vast and breathtaking
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.400]   in scope.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:57.640]   And if you've ever played Elite or I guess more within the realm of experience for Mac
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:03.240]   users, escape velocity, you have a basic frame of reference to use for what to expect here.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:08.080]   You're the captain of a spaceship and you start out with a little one and the more credits
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:13.040]   you get by varying people from location or varying cargo from location to location or
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.880]   running missions or blowing things up, the bigger, the vessel you can get.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.040]   But that's really only a small part of the game.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.160]   There's a player run economy that is absolutely vast and makes up well more than half the
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.440]   game.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:31.120]   You can buy and sell services and goods on a stock market type of system.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.720]   You can interact with other players in corporations, which are sort of the eve online equivalent
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.320]   to a guild from World of Warcraft.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:44.000]   And it is absolutely the most immersive game playing experience I've ever had in my life.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.720]   Plus there's a 14 day free trial that you can try out.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   Right.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.560]   So now I have now if I get nothing done for the next three weeks, it's because of you,
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.640]   Peter, between FaZe and Eve, I'm screwed.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.240]   Believe me, I'm as screwed as your man.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.240]   I totally relate.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.800]   I never going to get anything done.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   Absolutely.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.160]   I'm actually looking at it right now.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.320]   1995, you can buy it online.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.760]   How much a month do you play?
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.080]   Well, it's free for 14 days.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:13.120]   You can, 1995 is what you pay the first month that you first set up your account.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.440]   That is 1495 a month thereafter.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:20.200]   And you can actually buy bulk game cards from the eve online store if you want to get a
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.360]   three or six month break similar to what you would do with World of Warcraft.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.360]   Right.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:25.920]   Well, I'll have to cancel my World of Warcraft account.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.360]   I can see that.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.960]   No, I'll play in both, man.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:30.960]   Good.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.800]   I just don't have a glad I don't have a baby like Alex.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.280]   Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to do any of this.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.280]   Sorry, Alex.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.280]   You left out Alex.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:40.800]   You can sell your baby and play Eve online all you want.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.800]   I've been living in dollars.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.000]   Do you get for a live baby these days?
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   Please.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.640]   Alex, do you have a pick for us?
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   I do.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.640]   I do.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:53.840]   I actually saw this on the Mac break ideas, the MBW ideas.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.840]   And I just didn't.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.240]   I'm sure that you guys all know about it, but I hadn't played with it that much.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.120]   And so I use a lot of Netflix and I downloaded this Netflix free.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.840]   Oh, I love this program.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.840]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.840]   I'm never going back to the website.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.840]   Oh, no.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   It's just like it's such a great.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   Now, this gets into this.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.480]   I'm afraid that this kind of gets into my argument that what I really want is lots of
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.560]   net apps and I don't really like to go to the website.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.040]   And we all know that I hate going to websites.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.160]   So I'm much rather work with a net app.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.360]   And that's what this is.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.800]   So this gets me to what I really want to know, which is I can manage my queue.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:32.280]   So I have this huge queue of movies and I can change their order, everything else.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.280]   I'm not on a webpage.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.880]   Maybe the list of them, I can move them around.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.720]   I can see what I've checked out, what I have checked out, what I have not released or what's
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:43.680]   not been released of the things that are on my list, my history.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:46.360]   I can browse titles.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.760]   So there's all of this stuff that I can do here without actually having to go to the
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.520]   website at all.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.480]   And for the day to day stuff, maybe I want to go to the website to use some of the stuff
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.840]   to find new movies.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:01.200]   But I mean, I have a queue of like 60 movies, so I don't need that anytime soon.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:08.080]   So anyway, it's just a really fantastic little tool and it's 15 bucks.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.480]   So 146th, I think of an Alex.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.280]   The little appfactory.com.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.520]   And it's really.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.520]   I concur.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.640]   I mean, this is a must have if you use Netflix anyway.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.000]   You guys aren't using Netflix.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Who doesn't use Netflix?
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   I agree.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.440]   I tried Blockbuster for like a month and it was so awful.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.240]   Blockbuster, like pretty much closing all their stores.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.840]   I mean, they're on their way.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:35.040]   I really love about that app more than anything.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:41.400]   It was the ability to randomize your queue because I think like most people, you get
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:46.640]   sort of on a kick where you suddenly are placing every single like really good like
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.640]   Japanese like Ozou.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.640]   Right.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:50.640]   Part of it's Netflix.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.080]   Like two, then for like two months straight, you're getting nothing but like Ozou felt
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   like floating.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.680]   Oh, floating weeds again.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.640]   Oh, this is the director's cut.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.040]   Oh, what happens is I want a quality.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.040]   Sure.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   Moving now.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.720]   I mean, well, part of it is that Netflix, you know, what happens with Netflix, of course,
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:08.760]   is that you click as soon as you say, I want this one.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.160]   It says, well, you might like these ones and turn off.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.640]   I do like those ones.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:16.280]   And so yeah, I ended up with like I hit unforgiven and then I ended up with Silverado and pale
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.280]   rider.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.920]   You know, it's the same thing.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.920]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.080]   Netflix freak from the little appfactory excellent and well worth the 20 bucks.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:28.600]   Annie and I co your pick.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:29.600]   This is an oddball one.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   It's a screensaver.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:36.760]   It is free, but it is one of the most creepily compelling screensavers ever.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:43.600]   There is a kind of webcam security camera made by a company called Access where it has
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.520]   its own built in web server.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.960]   So all they got to do is plug it into your home network or even via Wi-Fi and then you
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   can access it for any web browser and find and take a look outside your window.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:57.720]   I actually have one here in the office that's actually the only point to it is that it points
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.160]   down the street so that if I'm elsewhere in the house or elsewhere in the office and
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:05.280]   I hear like a big diesel engine, if it's the FedEx guy, I want to make sure that like
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.720]   I've got my pants on.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.120]   I'm downstairs ready to sign for something.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:13.920]   But you can't access my webcam unless you are inside my own house and you know the password
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.920]   to access it.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:18.440]   A lot of people they just leave it completely open and it's on the real internet.
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:20.040]   Oh, I like that.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:24.120]   So, so this guy wrote this incredible screensaver called surveillance saver.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.120]   Oh boy.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:30.640]   It uses a they uses a little bit of Google food where searches for images generated by
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.040]   access cameras.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:36.880]   So what happens is like right now like I've got the I have it in screensaver mode and
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.640]   I haven't been touching the keyboard of the mouse.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:44.640]   And so all of a sudden my Skype window closes and I see a I'm not making this up.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:51.560]   But after some examination proves to be some sort of automated milking machine outside
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:56.440]   of it and I can select and updates like once every second so I can see that you know the
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.120]   legs are moving a little bit.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:01.240]   And then you know then like three minutes later like there was some movement and a new
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.800]   cow came in.
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:08.000]   So every time it activates it will find a different open camera and give you a different
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   live feed right now.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.560]   Right now I jiggle the I jiggle the mouse and reset it again and I'm looking at some
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:16.120]   sort of a traffic circle somewhere.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.240]   It's I'm waiting I'm waiting for the time when we find out when it accidentally finds
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.040]   one of those like NBC to catch a predator cameras.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.040]   Oh boy.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:29.240]   And that's the point where which I destroyed I never ever ever ever launch it ever again.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.880]   But it's for now it's all in good fun.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.040]   It really is pretty cool.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.040]   It is on it is an alpha development right now.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:43.360]   It also is behind one of those URLs that could be I don't know it's almost like geo
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.520]   cities it's so complicated.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.240]   But it will be I just sent it to you via chat and you should be on it.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   But I'm sure it's a weird it's a weird one I document that M 0 5 D.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.840]   But yeah, yeah, baby.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.760]   I'm looking at the inside of some sort of a computer lab.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:07.520]   You all guys say is if I was the NSA I would just make one of these and said yet all.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.680]   Get all save all that is just wild.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.840]   We have an access camera at the lab with Leo and these are just these are basically security
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:20.400]   cams that have web servers so they're often very public so you use one too.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.680]   Yeah, because they're so easy to set up.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.440]   They're so easy to access as a matter of fact I use a quick time player on any you know
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.360]   any Mac or any PC so that again anywhere in the house I can just essentially look out
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.080]   my window and see again is there a UPS truck.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   It's really neat.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.640]   It's their new neat cameras.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.720]   They're what also they just plain work.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.640]   But again it's it is kind of creepy to know that if you don't realize they need to be
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.640]   secured.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.880]   There's also probably as as interesting as the screen saver I'm not I'm no stranger to
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:53.640]   this sort of Google food and the iPhone book actually do a little section on here's how
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   you can search open web servers.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.800]   People's people's file directories on open web servers for if you want to find a blue
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800]   grass mp3.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.880]   Here's how to face this will look for files that are stored in open directories.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.000]   So the the web page for this surveillance saver gives you the actual URL.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   So if you I mean if you just sit there in front of the your Safari window and just keep click
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.200]   this click this Google search URL and keep refreshing and keep refreshing it.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.440]   It's I'm sure there was an episode of Star Trek where there's some sort of teleport portal
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.400]   on some alien land that keeps sending it to different places.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   It's exactly like that.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.040]   Suddenly I'm in the Swiss app Alps.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.560]   Suddenly I'm looking at a lighthouse.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.560]   Suddenly I'm looking at a calf being milked.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.440]   I'll all of a sudden I feel like William Baldwin and sliver.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.000]   Yeah, it's exactly it.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.920]   You never know what you might see.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.000]   We're Sharon Stone.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.120]   Yeah, I'm watching it right now.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.320]   I've got some traffic circle.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.520]   I hope it gets more interesting than that.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.080]   I'm not sure exactly how it does it because I have seen the computer lab before.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:53.280]   I first found this last night and well actually no I found the computer lab via a different
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.280]   search.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.960]   So it's possible that there's a limited pool of open and accessible access cameras and
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.000]   I'm sure that it will if you leave it open for a week you'll probably see some repeats
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   of cameras.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.360]   I like how within the space of of the time that Andy's been talking about this.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.760]   All of us have downloaded and installed it.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.760]   Absolutely.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.760]   Hey, I also got phase running.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.160]   So don't feel a little left out of here.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.800]   I'm leaving at my access camera Leo.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.800]   Can you see me?
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.400]   If I didn't already have Netflix freak and have that downloaded too.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.480]   That's part of the fun of these of these shares.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.560]   Good pick and that's absolutely free and it is a weird it's I dot document.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.960]   I don't know what that means but it's it's a weird URL but we'll put it in the show notes.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.880]   Thanks to a Shash who has taken our show notes this week and for the last couple of weeks
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.160]   absolutely he's doing it as a volunteer effort so we thank him and we will start having
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.720]   shown us back again on the Twitter page.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:47.840]   So just go to twitter.tv/mbw and you can get your your link to surveillance saver alpha
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.680]   zero if that doesn't scare you nothing.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.320]   I love that actually we'll we'll need to download a codec but that's okay.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.320]   Just click okay.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.320]   Yeah, just say okay.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.320]   It's fine.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.560]   It's fine.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.440]   I do want to you know, channeling Scott born who couldn't be with us this week.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.160]   We'll be back next week and by the way I should remind you we're all going to you're
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.960]   going right Alex to blog world or no you can't go to the bar.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.960]   You are.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960]   All right.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960]   So I'm going to blog world Scott will be there.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960]   I'll be there.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.960]   Look for us.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.960]   I'll be doing the keynote on podcasting on Friday morning.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.600]   That should be a lot of fun.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.880]   So we hope we'll catch you there and we will see Scott down there.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.640]   Maybe we'll do a special little mini Mac break weekly from that down there.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.160]   We'll talk to some of the podcasters and bloggers who are down there blog world Expo
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.240]   dot com for that.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.800]   And you remember last last week he picked a screen saver from leopard.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.120]   He said the favorite part is favorite part of leopard was shell.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.880]   This isn't really my pick since you've already got it.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.720]   But I just love this.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   I didn't know this.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.840]   There is a mosaic maker in in leopard.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.520]   Have you seen this?
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.960]   You pick any full any eye photo folder.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.080]   You have to have some eye photos and then it's in the screen saver control panel.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.480]   The normal display style is that you know, Ken Burns slideshow effect.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.280]   There's a collage effect too.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.960]   But click the third tab.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.480]   It's his mosaic.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.320]   What it will do is it'll take all the pictures in your folder and it will do one of those
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.400]   cool photo mosaics where it grades them all based on luminance and color and then uses
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.520]   them to put together a larger picture.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.480]   And it does this all on the fly while you're watching the screen saver and it is really
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.840]   a cool screen saver.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:26.200]   So it starts with a big image from your iPhoto library kind of starts to zoom out and you
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.920]   see that that big what seemed like a big image is really just a pixel in a much much
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:35.000]   larger image which is one of your other images that it's created out of a photo mosaics.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.960]   So it's a very cool photo mosaic screen saver and it comes with leopard.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.440]   So highly recommend this as a screen saver.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.800]   But it is not my pick.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.920]   I want to thank CB for recommending my pick.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.480]   She's a regular around here and does lots of great suggestions.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.800]   And some time ago she recommended a very simple word processor for free.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.160]   It's kind of a text edit on steroids.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.640]   It's called Bean.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.040]   Has anybody used Bean before?
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.240]   It's really I really like this.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:08.080]   It's free and it's easy to download and it's a simple word processor.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:14.000]   But a little more boom if it's really more like a word processor than text edit is.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.280]   It's from Bean dash os x dot com.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:26.960]   It creates rich text files although it will open MS word and office files as well.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:33.320]   If you have pages you probably don't need Bean because the pages editing of what it
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.880]   interfaces really is really clean and simple.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.880]   But I like Bean.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.040]   It's you know I've always wanted something very simple for word processing.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.600]   I collect a Mac word processor.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.720]   So this is just another one to add to your list.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.960]   It does seem to work with leopard no problem at all.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.200]   It's Bean dash os x dot com and it's zero.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.080]   Alex's and it has a really cool icon a coffee icon.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.040]   So you got to like it for that if nothing else.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.600]   Those are our picks.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.240]   Those are our recommendations.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.440]   We thank Peter Cohen so much for joining us.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.760]   Peter is there anything you'd like to plug besides the fact that your senior editor at
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.760]   Mac world magazine?
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.960]   Oh no.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.720]   No blog or anything you want to point people to.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.960]   No, no I'm good.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.960]   I'm good.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.120]   I'll do that next time.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.440]   Come back and join us again.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:21.280]   I would love to Alex Lindsey is at the pixel core P I X E L C O R P S dot com and dot TV
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:27.680]   dot TV for the video podcasts and dot com for the great guild of multimedia artists which
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.000]   everyone should be a member of.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.520]   It's a really great group.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.520]   We've got it.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.780]   We've got it right now where we're putting out a couple of the Mac break studios that
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:34.780]   are in the Mac break feed.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.240]   We're going to open that back up to doing all kinds of Mac stuff.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.120]   We're just kind of getting people to give people that before we split the feed so that
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.440]   Mac break studio has its own.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.200]   It's own little feed for people.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:49.440]   But right now if you if you go to Mac break video on Mac on Vix core TV you'll see a lot
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:55.200]   of some of the top trainers for the final cup pro studio apps talking about how to get
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.200]   the most out of Final Cut Pro studio.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.200]   So definitely check it out.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.280]   Alex is working hard on our Mac world coverage.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.160]   We hope to have news for you on that too soon.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.440]   I think we'll probably be doing we've done in the past a lot of good coverage of Mac world
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.400]   Expo and I'm sure it's going to be crazy the craziest year ever.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.400]   It's going to be insane.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.800]   We're going to have to bear wasn't.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.520]   I hope we can get Merlin out of retirement for that at least.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.160]   I sent him an email every week saying come on Merlin.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.160]   Babies just sleep.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.840]   You don't need to come on.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.120]   They don't need you right now.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.960]   Now's the time.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.560]   Join us.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.560]   But nothing.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.880]   He doesn't even reply.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.360]   Does he reply to your emails?
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.360]   No.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.360]   He's still Twittering.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.360]   I know he's alive.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.360]   He's there somewhere.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.360]   All right.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.360]   I have to go play phase.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.600]   So I'm going to hurry this up.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:43.640]   Andy Enaco is at of course the Chicago Sun times and you can catch him on his website.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:51.520]   www.cwob.com the colossal waste of bandwidth also known as yellow text and watch his access
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.520]   camera for underwear shots any day now.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.680]   Oh, the P.F.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.760]   Happy underwear shots of somebody who's in my driveway.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.800]   Which which still one will at least one out of four times will be me.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.800]   So it could happen.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:04.800]   It could happen.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.800]   The ponytail.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800]   It could happen.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:07.800]   It could happen.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.800]   We'll be able to get a little support.
