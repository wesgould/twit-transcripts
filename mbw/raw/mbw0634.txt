[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.960]   And there's Mac news.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.480]   We brought in the A team, actually Renee Ritchie is in Brooklyn right now.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.000]   So sitting in for Renee, managing editor at iMore.com.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.640]   Lori Gill, great to have you, Lori.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.640]   Thank you.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.640]   I'm going to just go ahead and say Renee is now the B team and I'm the A team.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.640]   So he's out.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.640]   He's out.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.640]   Thank God.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.640]   Finally.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.640]   A coup.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.000]   I've been working on this for two years.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.400]   I finally get the A spot.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.040]   He left out and he's never coming back.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.440]   Andy Enoco is at the Apple event in Brooklyn.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.360]   He's visiting a friend studio to come to us today, which is nice.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.600]   Thanks for being here, Andy.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   Thank you.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.560]   And Lori, I think that it is time for regime change.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.600]   I really believe that iMore readers will welcome you as liberators.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.960]   You can knock down that statue of Renee in the lobby for one thing.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.920]   Renee, I sometimes forget how hard he works at these events.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.040]   He's like, oh, if he's got a phone in his hand, he's capturing content somewhere of something.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   So he's the...
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:41.220]   Or saying "F
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:03:02.040]   Hey, everyone."
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.400]   So I would also have to say that if this were an event I was attending on San Francisco,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.640]   I'd probably have a hotel room that's only 10 minutes away as opposed to having to ride
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.000]   and crack for three and a half hours and get into town at 3.30 and spend time and all
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.800]   night diners and doing work.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   It was cool.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   But...
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.600]   Andy, we should mention for those of you listening is on his AirPods.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.440]   So that explains the...
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.480]   He sounds a little bit distant, but that's all right.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.320]   He's with us in spirit and that's what counts.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.760]   Well, we're all here in spirit.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.040]   Who was excited when the very first words practically out of Tim's cook's mouth were
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   Macintosh?
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.240]   Man, that made me happy.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.960]   You know, I have to say it was an enthusiastic set of Apple executives and audience.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.200]   Much more so than normal.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.040]   Well, it was pretty clear.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.200]   And I mentioned this during our broadcast of the stream that the audience was loaded with
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.000]   Apple employees and actually once he started, once Angela Arrens took the stage and they
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.400]   started talking about Apple retail, the crowd really went crazy.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.480]   So I'm guessing there were a lot of people from Apple retail in the audience.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.960]   Chills, chill, I'd say.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.200]   Yeah, I mean, it was a much bigger auditorium than they have in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   Right, Andy?
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.560]   About the same.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.440]   It was an opera house on the Brooklyn campus.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.280]   But two layers of mezzanine and a ground floor, I would guess a little bit less than a thousand
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   people.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   Sound like 10,000 when they start sharing.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.320]   No, I mean, that's what you get.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.280]   Sometimes when your boss comes on stage, you are actually legitimately excited to see
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.480]   your boss on stage.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.440]   You cheer pretty loudly.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.080]   And there are a bunch of applause breaks that I didn't anticipate.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:57.600]   When they're talking about how all the aluminum is reclaimed from other aluminum shaping processes.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.240]   And so we have a back book frame that's 100% recycled.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.080]   I think it actually took Apple off balance a little bit themselves.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.240]   Yeah, and the biggest cheers though, as I said, we're during the conversations about
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.240]   retail.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.080]   And so I'm guessing that they brought in a lot of retail employees.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.080]   Apple does that.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.560]   They want the audience to sound excited, enthusiastic.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.320]   Journalists are famous for sitting on their hands.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.920]   And I presume that's what most of the journalists are doing at the event today.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   However much.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.920]   And or typing.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   And or typing.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.720]   You can't type when you're sitting on your head.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.640]   And I presume that however much their little hearts were going pittapat, they didn't express
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.720]   that by cheering.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.440]   But I have to say internally I was going, yeah, some love for the max.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.280]   Let's go through the event from beginning to end in chronological order.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.440]   There's more in the making.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.720]   We saw more of the Apple custom logos.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.320]   They set out almost 400 in invitations.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.880]   But many more, I guess were used in the signage at the event.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.120]   And I see some on the home page as well.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.600]   It's funny because the order of introduction on the on the homepage starts with the iPad
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   Pro.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.800]   But Tim started with the Mac book air.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.240]   We were very glad to see a new Mac book air finally with a retina display.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.040]   Although the same beautiful wedge design.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.120]   Little bit thinner than the previous Mac book air and a little bit more pricey.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.680]   We were hoping at least some were hoping to get down to a 9.99 price point.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.360]   I guess the 13 inch the old Mac book air is now 9.99.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:45.080]   But if you want to get the retina display, it's 1199 to start or 1399 depending on storage
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.440]   because you don't get a choice.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.120]   It looks like in processor.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.560]   No, in every case you're going to get an Intel 8th generation Y processor, which is
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.920]   they're kind of low and slow mobile part of dual core 1.6 gigahertz.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.040]   I five that turbo boost to 3.6.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.080]   This is not as I have one in my surface go.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.960]   It is not a notably speedy processor.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.600]   The base model comes with 128 gigs SSD for 1399 to get 256.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.400]   And you can go all the way up to one and a half terabytes if you've got enough money.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.440]   Eight gigs of RAM standard 16 gigs possible.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:32.160]   And 50.3 watt hour lithium ion battery, they say about a little bit more battery life than
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.360]   before about 13 hours of active movie play a back on the iPad air Mac.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.880]   They were saying the same amount of time for browsing the web, but for some reason more
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.400]   time for the movie voice.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.240]   For iTunes movies specifically, they did point out iTunes movies.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.240]   You think that's key?
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.800]   I don't know, but they did point it out, which makes you think, well, maybe that, you know,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.160]   if you try that with, you know, your Plex movies, it's not as good or something like that.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   We'll have a review unit.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.760]   These are orderable today immediately as you're listening to this.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:11.160]   And if you order soon enough before supplies run out, which I doubt will happen, you'll
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.080]   be able to get it on Wednesday, November 7th.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.400]   In fact, everything we talk about today, you can order now and November 7th.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.000]   Well, I think I certainly was a little bit waiting for, oh, you're going to say your
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.440]   first half of 2019 for the new Mac, but yeah, everything's on track, everything's ready
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.440]   to go.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.240]   But yeah, the new Mac, but there looks great.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.320]   It looks like a really great update.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.240]   It's still a 100% quality piece of kit.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.120]   You also get a touch ID.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.520]   You also get a T2 security chip behind it and all the other features that are in there.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.640]   Is it interesting that they're giving you touch ID, but they're not giving you the touch
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.640]   bar?
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.880]   Yeah, touch bars and go anywhere.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   I think that's just because you can't put another OLED display in there and still make
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.120]   money off of such a cheap price point.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.760]   We're practically giving these things away at the price they're giving you.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.880]   But otherwise, all the things that are actually important, all the things you actually want,
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.640]   I actually would rather have an escape key that is actually where we're actually is.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.440]   The touch ID is also, it is in fact a clicky button.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.600]   It has a sapphire top on it, but it's also the power button.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.760]   So even that is not just simply a piece of glass that's immobile and infuriating.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.800]   The display is wonderful.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.720]   Of course, they had to swap out for a better display.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.920]   It must be a problem of internal topology that they decided could both USB, USB, excuse
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.400]   me, both Thunderbolt ports on the same side of the device as opposed to putting one on
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.280]   one side, one on the other.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.680]   But as they did with the more expensive MacBooks, they didn't have one will only do power and
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.120]   won't do video.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.480]   They're both pretty much the same interpretive capability.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.200]   You can hook up a 5K display to one.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.320]   You can't support, it can't drive two 5K displays.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.280]   But you are getting a fully flexible thing.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.760]   It also runs a GPU.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:11.000]   It really does feel like a mini MacBook Pro, complete with the identical keyboard at all.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.720]   That's actually the interesting fact.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.240]   While we were watching, everyone was, we have a Slack, a public Slack group and everyone
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.600]   was following.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   It was all very positive.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:28.560]   Then when I sat down to actually write about it and started comparing to the other models,
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.720]   the 13-inch non-touch bar MacBook Pro is only 100 bucks more and has significantly more
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.200]   performance.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.640]   The only real difference is you get is the MacBook Pro is bit heavier, it's quarter pound
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   heavier and it doesn't have touch ID.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.720]   It has a better retina screen and it has a faster processor.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.800]   It's a funny place in the lineup actually.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:00.160]   Yeah, Andy shouldn't be too sanguine until you get these.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.120]   These are not great.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.640]   This was the knock on the MacBook which is this Core M processor.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.960]   These Y processors are a similar kind of crap part.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:19.920]   You'll notice that when you read Apple's press release about this, they are very careful
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.120]   not to praise the performance.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.280]   They just say it's performance for your everyday task.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.160]   They don't say how much faster it is than the old ones.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.320]   If they don't say that, it's not.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.320]   It's not.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:37.480]   Thunderbolt 3 ports, that's a good news because they work for charging display port Thunderbolt
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.840]   and USB-C.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.920]   Because Mojave supports the eGPU, these don't come with GPUs but if you had any GPU lying
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:51.560]   around for other reasons, I guess you could beef up at least the GPU on this.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.600]   This is more like a MacBook in some respects than it is a MacBook Pro.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.760]   It also, I should point out, is going to use the new keyboard.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.080]   So I know Andy, you weren't crazy about Butterfly 2 keys.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.000]   Yeah, I did give it some typing tests today.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.200]   Is the latest generation the exact same thing that got in the latest model of MacBook?
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.480]   So if you can deal with it great, if you don't like it, then you're not going to like this
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.480]   one anymore.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.880]   I don't like the new MacBook Pro better than the old ones and it's usable for me.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:27.280]   Just a little bit of that, a little bit more travel, a little bit more cush.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.000]   Laurie Gill, are you rushing out to buy the new MacBook Air?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.120]   Well, only because I've already spent a lot of money on lots of other things.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.160]   I am not going to get the MacBook Air.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.960]   It doesn't fit what I do with my life.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   I don't need that version of that.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.840]   Do you use a MacBook by any chance?
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.800]   I have a MacBook Pro and I have a iMac.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   Those are the two.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.000]   Not the super thin MacBook.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.040]   We had MacBooks, at least my wife uses it.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.320]   And she's really started to bemoan the lack of speed, especially when she's doing photos.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:03.760]   So that's what I think the air is positioning itself to be that sort of replacement for
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.240]   people that don't need quite the advanced processing speed as the Pro, but want an update
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.360]   from the air.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.920]   The air is up until just now, the air was really needed some dusting off.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.440]   It was a little bit old in the MacBook itself.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.600]   It's fine, but it hybrids them into one.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.240]   So you don't even need to get as advanced as a MacBook.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.440]   You can get the MacBook Air in.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.920]   It has a lot of the stuff that the MacBook already comes with.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.360]   The things that were missing from the air that some people might have thought was really
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.320]   something they needed that was missing from the air.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.000]   They can have that now like Thunderbolt 3 ports.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.720]   The updated trackpad I think is a really big deal with the larger size trackpad.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.280]   I think that's going to be a real bonus for people using a new trackpad.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.080]   That was for me when I went from an old MacBook Air to the new MacBook Air that had the larger
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.080]   trackpad.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   The difference was amazing.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.640]   And I think that's going to be really nice for people upgrading.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.280]   But this is definitely an upgrade from an air model.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.520]   This is not a downgrade from the Pro model.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.960]   I have never owned a MacBook.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.000]   I've never owned a MacBook.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.760]   I don't know for sure whether this will feel like an upgrade or a downgrade.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.280]   It might be straight across the board.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.640]   Switch over from MacBook to MacBook Air.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.720]   Maybe somebody who has the MacBook would know a little bit more details on how the tech-wise
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.640]   or spec-wise, whether or not they think that that's going to carry over in that way.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.680]   I'll have a head comparison for you next week because Lisa bought it and she's going
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.680]   to compare it.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:45.440]   And she said right away, I'm returning it if it's not appreciably faster than my MacBook.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.320]   And I bet it'll be faster.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.200]   Ironically, the old MacBook Air had faster CPUs available to it.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.640]   Again, nice 7 in the old MacBook Air.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.640]   Yeah, and faster clock speeds too.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.960]   Do you think, Adam, this is a replacement for the MacBook?
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.000]   Do you think we'll see a MacBook next year?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.080]   The thing that threw me was looking at Apple's comparison page afterwards and realizing they
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.880]   now have six laptops.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.880]   Keeping the 12-inch around, which I have never been a fan of the 12-inch, just a processor
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:24.400]   I couldn't believe, and a single USB-C port, not even Thunderbolt 3.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.640]   Why haven't they updated that?
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.000]   Or gotten rid of it, one or the other?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.320]   And then keeping the old MacBook Air around with the old ports and various non-retina
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.280]   screen, again, just feels odd.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.720]   I understand that, yeah, it's $200 cheaper.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.600]   But I guess what I would have liked to have seen Apple do is introduce this new one at
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.560]   the $9.99 price point.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.280]   I think everybody was hoping for that one.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.720]   And then just drop the old ones.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.880]   Like, OK, and see now you've got this thing where, geez, do I want the Thunderbolt 3 and
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.840]   the Retina display and the Touch ID and have to carry dongles?
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.240]   Or do I go back, save $200 and get a lousy monitor?
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.960]   And yeah, I don't know.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.560]   I'm just frustrated that Apple has made the decision even more confusing than it was before
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.000]   and it was confusing before.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.720]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.200]   Is it the end of the line for the MacBook?
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Are we going to see a new one in 2018?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.280]   MacBook seems like it's really well engineered to run on an AR processor.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.680]   So if that's not the electricity for three years, they may as well keep it limping along
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.000]   until they can introduce something new at the heart of it.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   That's interesting.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.640]   It's hard to think about recommending someone get a MacBook as opposed to a MacBook.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.680]   They're considering all the things you're going to get with these 2018 models though.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.960]   So I mean, it doesn't have the performance certainly of a modern MacBook Pro.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.760]   But the creature comforts that you might have been calling for, again, being able to have
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.840]   thunderbolts, the ability to have Touch ID and having a Retina display and the ability
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:07.320]   to have something that is as thin and as light as possible, which as I've said before, more
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.480]   than a few times, that's a context in which the super, super skinny keyboard at least
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:17.360]   makes sense when you're having something that makes the MacBook Pro look like a box of Whitman
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.240]   sampler chocolates, it's so fair to the MacBook Air.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.520]   It certainly makes sense for that.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:32.320]   So I wish that Apple would continue to have a $1,000 MacBook, but it's useful because
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.320]   the current MacBook Air is what they released today.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.920]   It's at least within reach for someone who is going for a notebook, but it's not going
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.960]   to do a lot to convince someone not to get a Windows laptop.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.520]   And if Apple can't convince these people to go for an iPad Pro instead, they're going
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.520]   to lose that sale.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.400]   Yeah, if you look at Huawei's MateBook, which a lot of people thought is what the MacBook
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:04.040]   Air should become, the MateBook Pro X10 or whatever it's called, MateX10 is in most respects
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   a superior product.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.520]   The only difference is you got to run Windows on it.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   But the bezels are narrower.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.720]   In fact, so narrow that they have to put the camera and the keyboard.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:22.160]   It's a thinner, lighter and it tops out at less expensive with bigger processors.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.600]   I think in every respect this is what people were hoping for from Apple with the MacBook
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.600]   Air.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.560]   And of course, the irony of this is all of these Ultrabooks, including the MateBook are
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.960]   based on the MacBook Air.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.600]   I mean, they exist because the Air created this.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.880]   Good news though, for people who care about the planet and who don't want to pay tariffs
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:49.240]   on Chinese aluminum or Canadian aluminum or any kind of aluminum, this is all recycled
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.600]   aluminum, which is interesting, which saves, of course, a lot of energy.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.640]   They set a 50% smaller carbon footprint, but also saves a lot of money because of aluminum
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.640]   tariffs.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.120]   This and all the aluminum stuff, I think, is, well, I should take that back.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.280]   The aluminum in the iPads may not be that recycled aluminum.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.280]   They're recyclable.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.040]   They didn't call it out specifically.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.200]   They're recyclable, not recycled.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.440]   There's a difference.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.760]   But these Airs, I think, they're in small enough quantity that they can use entirely recycled
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.760]   aluminum for these.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   Also, 35% post-consumer recycled plastic in the integral components.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.080]   Like the speakers, 100% recycled tin in the logic board.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.160]   So they're trying to look nice.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.600]   It looks green, for sure.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.200]   And I think using recycled aluminum is a good thing all around.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.680]   That's fine.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.680]   All around.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   That's fine.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.840]   We're going to... there's more to say.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   More max, even.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.920]   We'll get to that in just a second.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.400]   Adam Inks from TIDBITS is here.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   Andy Inako, he's in Brooklyn right now, just coming off the Apple event from WGBH in Boston
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.440]   and Laurie Gill, who's managing editor at iMore.com.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.720]   So today, brought to you by PayPal.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.840]   I don't think I have to tell you who PayPal is, right?
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   When it comes to growing your business, PayPal is your payments partner for today and tomorrow.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.600]   When we set up TWIT, when we first wanted to take contributions way back in 2005, it
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.440]   was PayPal, all the way.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.320]   Take Linda, one of the first online consignors in the early days of Internet auctions.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.280]   She took her hobby of locating hard-defined items and turned it into a thriving luxury
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.360]   consignment company called Linda's Stuff, selling first her kids' video games and her
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   own clothes online.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.680]   She used to be an attorney in New York City.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.280]   She'd pretend to be in the library doing illegal research when instead she was following
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.960]   her bliss, hunting bargains.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.840]   She'd turn it a love for fashion and to an empire scaling her business from a kitchen
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:53.080]   counter to now let's get this, a 93,000 square foot warehouse and 100 employees.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.920]   You go, Linda.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   Linda's Stuff.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.400]   A lot of it is a company specializing in high-end, previously owned goods.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.920]   She knows reputation is everything.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.240]   Integrity and trust are a critical part of how her company operates.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.800]   Her business is family owned.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.560]   Her son joined the company five years ago and they celebrate that family spirit with
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.560]   their employees.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.080]   From day one, you better believe that Linda has trusted PayPal to have protect her business
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.360]   from fraud even when selling internationally.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.960]   Linda is proof positive that with hard work, the right tools and talent, you can grow your
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.960]   business.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.000]   She's counted on PayPal every step of the way.

[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.440]   We thank them for their support of Mac break weekly.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.120]   So I can't believe we got new Mac minis.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.800]   You know, I know that was the rumor we're going to get new Mac book errors, new Mac minis,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.040]   but I didn't want to believe it because I didn't want to be disappointed.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   I was not.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:44.840]   We have, we have new Mac minis and they, I think these, I have qualms about the Mac book here,
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:50.240]   but I have no question that these Mac book Mac minis are what people like Alec Lindsey,
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:57.040]   Alex Lindsey and a lot of people who, including us rely on the smallest Mac wanted to see.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:03.560]   This is very much a pro and you get a better choice of processes all the way up to an eighth
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:11.520]   generation six core I seven CPU faster memory up to 64 gigs.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.400]   And I love the connectivity.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:21.120]   And that I think kind of tells you something about how people use the Mac mini full is throw
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:30.600]   HDMI 2.0 port to USB three ports type A connectors for thunderbolt three ports, the type C connectors,
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:37.240]   ethernet that can be upgraded to 10 giga bits and a headphone jack.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.600]   By the way, I should mention that the air has a headphone jack too.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600]   Thank goodness.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:48.680]   Yeah, what's, it's, it's, the, the worry that I had was that it was going to be one of those
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.680]   wishing a monkey's popping.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   First, okay, congratulations.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.240]   We've upgraded, we've created a new version of the Mac mini.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.320]   We're calling it the Mac mini pro.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.600]   It's the size of a shape like a stick.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   It has no portion.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:07.760]   I have to say, when they showed the video, it looked like it was going to be round.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.600]   And I thought, Oh God, they've made it round.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:16.120]   No, it looks just like it looks like it looks like pretty much anything that you might have
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.920]   asked for saying, I don't care.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.280]   Don't, don't waste any time reengineering the case.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   Don't make it round.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.280]   Don't make it the size of a Mac mini.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:30.680]   Just give us the Mac mini with modern ports, the ability to like turn this into a beast
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:36.120]   of a machine, as they said, on stage there, and to make sure that it will run cool enough
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.120]   that we can stack them like pancakes.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:44.840]   I was so impressed when they're showing pictures of someone using it in a rendering situation
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.240]   where you have 60 of them.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.240]   Yeah, that was something, wasn't it?
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.280]   And then like just stacked up in a big server farm.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:57.840]   Clearly they knew how people like Alex and how most people outside of a home who use
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.760]   the Mac mini, why they love these things.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:07.720]   I think this is an example of Apple actually thinking about their customer and making sure
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.160]   that they were catering to the customer.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:15.880]   I think we hear a lot about Apple not really kind of catering to the Macbook Pro users.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.120]   And now it sounds like there's going to be a lot of, you know, what's up with the MacBook
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.520]   area, who is this for kind of stuff.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.600]   But with the Mac mini, they kept it the right size.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.040]   They gave it all kinds of good advanced guts.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.040]   They made sure that there was plenty of ports for them, for people to use.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.800]   They thought about what Mac mini users do and they stuck with that.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.440]   They didn't try to give you more.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.960]   They didn't try to nerf it.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   They made it exactly what Mac mini users wanted to be.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.200]   So I applaud them for not trying to appeal to a wider audience here.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.840]   They kept with their niche audience with this one.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.160]   Only one color that's that iMac Pro Space Grey.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:00.720]   And that's kind of another kind of signaling that this is the Pro Mac mini 799 for the quad
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.840]   core 3.6 gigahertz i3.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.000]   And then pretty low end there.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.160]   Go up to an i5 with six cores for 1099.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.200]   And you can go all the way up to an i7 in both configurations.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.880]   But it will cost you.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.520]   Should we max out?
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.520]   I'm just curious.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.760]   I do this all the time.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.400]   I love the Mac.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.520]   We'll start with the 1099.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.000]   We'll upgrade the processor a little bit to an i7 3.2 gigahertz six core.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.400]   I want to put in all 64 gigs of RAM by the way.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.040]   That extra RAM is going to cost you $1400.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.640]   You can get a two terabyte hard drive in there as well.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.200]   And you know, most people couldn't take advantage of 10 gigabit ethernet.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:49.040]   But thanks to SonicNet, we actually have 10 gigabit internet in our premises.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.520]   So I'm going to check that box.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.920]   I do already own Final Cut and Logic.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.320]   So I'm going to save a little money on that.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.040]   $4,199.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:06.320]   You can get a $4,000 Mac mini if your checkbook could support it.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.920]   Wow.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.200]   Most people obviously, and we did buy one.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.880]   I think we went to 16 gigs of RAM and we stuck with a minimum 256 gig storage.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.560]   That's plenty and a simple gigabit ethernet port.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.200]   That's $12.99.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.360]   That's actually not a bad price.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.080]   We're going to use it as an adjunct computer in our for our tricaster for things like FaceTime.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.480]   Because I want to do 32 of you in FaceTime.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.200]   So I think this is for people who use it in render farms, it will work with the eGPU,
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   which is great.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.840]   Because it doesn't have a GPU built in of any external GPU of any kind or discrete GPU
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.400]   of any kind.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.600]   Yeah, this looks like the Mac mini that they should do.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:58.720]   I was really pleased that it's rare that Apple makes a machine that is clearly intended
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:04.640]   for people who are buying this machine today as opposed to we're leading it into the future.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.440]   And three years every single person is going to be using a computer like this.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:13.280]   But for the next two years, if you buy one, it's really going to bite pretty hard because
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.840]   you're not going to have the ports in need.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.720]   But think how wonderful you'll be in two years from now.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.200]   This was the case of we know what our users want.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.800]   We've decided to just give them a simple practical game that won't get in the way of
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.160]   however they want to deploy them.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.640]   Yes.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:35.160]   There is a little bit of the future both in the MacBook Air and the Mac mini that I want
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.440]   to call attention to.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.920]   That's the T2 chip.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.240]   Both of them have the T2, which first debuted in the iMac Pro and has appeared in the 2018
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.720]   MacBook Pros.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.840]   Extensibly, this is the chip for the Touch ID and the secure enclave.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.160]   It drives the touch bar.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.480]   But notice neither of these computers have a touch bar.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.040]   In fact, this computer doesn't has a T2, but doesn't even have a fingerprint reader.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:07.040]   I think the T2 is, and this is what I said on our broadcast, the camel's nose under the
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   tent for getting arm into Macintosh.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.400]   These are arm-like chips designed by Apple.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.480]   And these are, in effect, dual chip computers.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:26.280]   They use the T2 for encrypting the hard drive in real time for security.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:31.440]   I might also point out that at some point they could use the T2 to prevent hackintoshes
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.320]   because I wouldn't be at all surprised to see at some point Mac OS for security reasons
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.400]   understand checking for a T2 chip.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:47.600]   It also means they can do the "Hey Siri" on these new machines.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.720]   We can't do that otherwise.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.520]   They also make a point about how they do a lot of video encoding, but it's a really
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.520]   jack-of-all trades machine.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.400]   I do feel like this...
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:06.000]   I expect that Apple, and I'm going to say as soon as this June at WDC, will start moving
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   developers towards arm, or not arm, but Apple designed chips.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:18.720]   Yeah, I think maybe we'll see just a class in Xcode that says, "Here's how to write
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.160]   software that is completely CPU independent."
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   Yes.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.280]   So if we do something, or rather, here are mistakes that we can't tell you why we don't
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.960]   want you to make these mistakes.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.960]   But if you stop making these mistakes now, it means that you can do something really
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   cool in just two hours with a word in two years instead of having to rebuild it.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:41.080]   So the thing that struck me about the T2 chip is that it is showing up in every new Mac
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.400]   that's significantly resigned.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.840]   MacBook Pros, or the iMac Pro, the iMac Pro, the latest MacBook Pros, and now these last
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.040]   two.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.600]   And so that's what we had wondered of what was going to happen with a touch bar.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.360]   Back when Apple first introduced a touch bar, what would we see it expanding across the
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   entire lineup?
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.360]   And it didn't happen.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.400]   That touch bar hasn't shut up anywhere else, whereas the T2 chip just keeps popping in.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.080]   And so I think that's an interesting fact.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.480]   It's got to cost them something to put the T2 chip in, but clearly that's something
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.280]   that Apple feels is completely worthwhile to build into every new machine as they redesign
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   the motherboard.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   That's what I mean.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.000]   I mean, you can't right now say, "Oh, you can't run Mac OS without a T2 chip.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.120]   There's too many older Macs that don't have a T2 chip."
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.880]   But I don't think it's any accident at all that every Mac they've announced in the last
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.400]   year has had a T2 chip, and I think all going forward will.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.200]   And then at some point that gives them the ability to pull that trigger and say, "You
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.440]   need a T2 chip to run Mac OS."
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.320]   I think it's mostly security though.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.440]   Well, that's security.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.880]   Well, right?
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.400]   It's definitely an advantage that they will prevent people from interfering with the
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.960]   BIOS and being able to run Mac OS.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   Right.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.800]   But it also means it'll interfere with bad people interfering with other people's BIOSes
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   to make to compromise their system.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   Yes.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   No, that's a benefit.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.760]   It's a religion and Apple.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:11.000]   Security and privacy is a religion, as well as a really good marketing point.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Right.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.320]   And as Roland points out in the chat room, they don't have to have an SSD control or
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   anymore.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.680]   They can have flash memory and use the T2 to control it.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   That's a benefit.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.520]   There's a lot of benefits to the T2.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.680]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.520]   So the Mac Mini and the MacBook Air, Hallelujah.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.000]   We got new Macs.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.520]   So one quick thing before we go on, what do people know about the i3 chip?
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.200]   I've never heard of the i3 before.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.840]   It hasn't been used in any Macs before.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.400]   I mean, it's widely used in Windows machines as a cheaper chip.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.600]   And I think it's a binned, basically it's probably a binned i5.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.640]   It's just a cheaper i5.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.520]   Maybe the Intel's disabling cache or changing the amount of cache available.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.240]   It's a cheap i5.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.800]   And Intel makes it for the low cost Windows machines.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.280]   All right.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.640]   So I'm really surprised to see an i3, frankly, in these Mac minis.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.640]   I don't.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:14.200]   And I guess the question then is, is that where the pricing, that was how Apple got it down
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   to $7.99.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.400]   And $7.99 is still a lot more than the Mac Mini used to be.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.760]   I mean, Mac Mini used to be at $4.99 to start.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   Wow.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.680]   In the most recent Mac Mini, $6.99, right?
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.120]   So that is interesting.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.520]   It's a pro machine, but it's also a pro price.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.520]   Right.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.760]   And you're not going to be just buying one of these to run a home media server in quite
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:41.200]   the same way because of how much you're going to spend for it.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.840]   That's an interesting question.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   It's an interesting question.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:50.320]   I wonder if they see some users that don't need the multi-threading, that don't need
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.520]   the extra cache that an i3 would be adequate for.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   I'm not sure.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.520]   Well, for us, it would be, right?
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.160]   Because we're just going to use this for FaceTime.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.440]   Yeah, there are a lot of use cases like that.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:08.520]   Every time I open up, every time I'm shown a system cabinet, like at a TV station or
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:13.280]   a radio station, I see that they've got whatever proprietary blades that they've got running
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   everything.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:18.240]   But they will also have one Mac Mini and they're just asking as a front end so they can virtualize
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.520]   and control everything with a really good user interface.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:27.840]   So if someone needs to buy a bunch of these for that kind of thing, 100 bucks to 100 bucks,
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.680]   and let's also not ignore that, it is that right now it's still the cheapest buy-in for
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.920]   someone who wants to get a Macintosh somewhere inside their house because Apple's never going
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.360]   to do an $800 MacBook.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.240]   iMacs are, they feel as though they have to put into a wonderful display.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.520]   So those are always going to be kind of premium priced things.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:56.120]   But if you've got an old HDMI TV around, if you've got a USB keyboard and somewhere, 799
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.200]   can give you a Macintosh in the house.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.880]   I still think that's kind of an important thing for Apple to do.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   I don't know.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.880]   I don't know.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.880]   I don't know.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:12.040]   I think it's just a question of less cash and slower clock speeds than anything else.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:17.900]   So I will say though, you look at the iMac pricing on the 21.5" iMac, the non-retin
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.720]   the one, is this 1099.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.860]   And it starts the next one up as 1299.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:28.260]   So all of these machines are showing up at like this 1299 price.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:32.380]   It actually is fairly difficult to choose between them on price because they all are
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.700]   within $100 one way or another.
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.700]   That's kind of a change.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:41.900]   We used to be able to say that Apple's pricing performance curve was kind of very clear and
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.500]   you got more when you pay more, but that isn't quite the case now.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:52.940]   I don't understand that it's the $800 iMac, excuse me, $800 Mac Mini.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.180]   And again, you don't necessarily, you're not necessarily going to go to the best buy-in
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.180]   buy-ex-re-monitor.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.380]   You can plug it into something you already have.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.540]   That's what I mean about the minimum buy-in.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.100]   If you don't necessarily want to buy a display, don't necessarily want to buy a keyboard
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.100]   to the mouse.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:11.220]   Just give me what I need to be able to run back into Mac OS.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:16.700]   I5 has more cash.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.700]   It does have hyperthreading.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.700]   It's free.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.780]   You know, Intel hasn't helped make it.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.700]   All right.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.700]   I know why after he started talking about the iPads, I realized why they led with the
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.580]   MacBooks.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:41.180]   If you did the Macintosh after the iPads, it would have been very depressing.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:47.980]   It has really all the speed, all the power, all the focus is clearly headed towards iPad.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.220]   iPad pros are much faster.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:56.340]   I think they're probably faster than the MacBook Airs at this point.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:04.700]   They did say that it has a faster graphic speed than 92% of all computers.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.300]   They said more than once.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:13.660]   They said at least twice that the iPad pros are faster than 92% of the laptops sold this
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.660]   year.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.660]   Yeah, that's 2%.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.060]   I don't know if that's by volume.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.100]   I don't know what that is, but by price.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.700]   All portable PCs.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:23.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:28.700]   Remember that these things go way, way down to like a big.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:34.060]   However, we have seen benchmarks on the iPhone XS that say it's faster than a MacBook in
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.020]   many cases.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:43.380]   So I think this is, I came away with a very strong feeling that this is the beginning
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.540]   of the end of Intel for Apple.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:55.020]   That's what this whole announcement presaged for me is the beginning of the end for Intel.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.980]   I don't think I agree.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:02.580]   I could definitely see them putting their own ARM processors in consumer-grade machines.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.580]   There'll be a level of MacBook Air, there'll be a level of Mac Medi, there'll be a level
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:11.100]   of iMac that has their own custom chips in it.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:16.660]   I don't know if Apple can produce the sort of chips that have the performance of the
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.100]   highest performance Intel chips.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.660]   I don't know when that's going to happen.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:25.540]   That's why I find it difficult to believe that they'll ever do a complete turnover of
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.860]   their chip line.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:32.060]   But it definitely has some advantages to have an ARM chip somewhere in the product line.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:37.900]   Well they started off talking about the A12X Bionic, which is even better than the A12
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.620]   Bionic in the new iPhones.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.980]   This is a chip with the 7nm process.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:52.500]   The first mass production 7nm chip, I think they're getting these from TSMC.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.340]   And I have to point out Intel hasn't even gotten to 10nm yet.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:05.980]   Yeah, admittedly, I don't think you're going to see a 265w Xeon class processor in an iPad
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.980]   at any point.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:11.260]   I know you're not, no mobile device would have anything like that.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:17.140]   But I do feel like they're really positioning these as beasts in terms of performance.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:23.420]   Let's start though with the form factor because that's a big change and much is expected.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:28.140]   There's two ways you can take advantage of these narrower or narrower bezels.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.140]   You can get more screen and a device of the same size.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:36.580]   That's what they're doing with the 11" iPad Pro or the same screen on a smaller size.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.260]   And that's what they did with the 12.9.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:43.180]   It's got the same screen size and resolution as the old iPad Pro 12.9.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:48.420]   But on a form factor they say about the size of an 8.5x11 piece of paper.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.220]   And I have to say I bought a 12.9 when it first came out.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.780]   And it did feel a little big for me.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.300]   I actually ended up giving that to an employee.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:03.340]   But if you can get it down to the size of a piece of paper, that might not be pretty usable.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.380]   It's not just the size of a piece of paper.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.580]   The fact that they removed all that glass and all that aluminum, it feels so light.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.580]   Oh, you felt it.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.580]   Tell us that.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.580]   It almost really almost felt like a prop.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:22.580]   It felt like a hollow shell of plastic compared to the 12.9" iPad Pro.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.060]   So I've had for the past two or three years.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.540]   The hard edges are a big win.
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.420]   For some reason it just feels like it kind of sits in your hands a little bit better.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:38.220]   I had to remind myself this was still a 12.9" iPad Pro for all that event.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.860]   I think a lot of people, once they pick it up, they're going to say I would much rather
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:47.420]   have the same size screen and much lighter device than anything that I've been using
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.540]   for the past couple of years.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.540]   How did the screen look?
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.540]   Not OLED.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.540]   It's retina.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:57.260]   The same liquid retina Apple's been touting on the iPhone XR.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:01.180]   Yeah, it looks great to me.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:05.180]   I couldn't really see any problems with it whatsoever.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.140]   Super dense, really good blacks, really good contrast.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.060]   No blowouts in any of the colors and reds.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.980]   I was kind of trying to find a way to make it cry a little bit, but it looked perfectly
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.780]   fine to me.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.980]   I like the rounded corners.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.980]   Those are pretty nice.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.980]   Tell us about that.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.220]   Okay, so rounded corners on the screen, which is odd.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:30.500]   If you look at previous iPads, the screen is clearly square.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.140]   They're just masking them off though, right?
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.860]   It's got to be a square screen.
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:42.340]   No, I think that they actually have shaped this way to have rounded corners.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.540]   What is the advantage of rounded corners on a screen?
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.340]   It's a bit of cool.
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.340]   Besides cutting off content, but is the advantage, right?
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.500]   Cutting off that last letter on the page.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.500]   What is the advantage?
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.500]   None.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.500]   It's aesthetics.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.500]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.220]   It's just looks.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.220]   Just looks.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.220]   Okay.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.220]   Yeah.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.220]   But when it looks good.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.860]   Hey, Steve likes rounded corners.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.700]   We're going to keep doing rounded corners.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.660]   Let me just say, since we're talking about it, I love this.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.260]   I love those rounded corners flat.
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.260]   I like that.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:21.500]   I love the form factor that's on the iPhone 5S or iPhone SE.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.780]   It's also the 5 and the 5S.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.780]   I like it.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:29.300]   So the fact that Apple is doing this with the design of the iPad, I am on board with
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.300]   it big time.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.300]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:35.500]   I mean, we've seen them on the iPhone, so it only makes sense.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:42.020]   And then they took the aluminum body and now it's squared off.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.780]   It's not rounded anymore.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.940]   How did that feel, Andy?
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.940]   Feels great.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.100]   I don't know why, but the fact that you have this corner nestling into your hand instead
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:54.500]   of having this rounded off edge to it feels really, really good.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:59.060]   Aesthetically, just as a device on the table, the fact that it doesn't have this fake,
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:04.220]   this curve that's trying to trick into thinking that it's a lot thinner than it actually is,
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:09.460]   it just feels like a more substantial thing without making it any heavier whatsoever.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.860]   Don't feel it's kind of weird.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:19.380]   As far as I know, they didn't make any radical changes to the camera, but to make it that
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.780]   thin and to keep with that design, they did have to have a camera bump.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.780]   There's a bump.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.780]   There is a bump.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:30.620]   You don't really notice it, but it was an interesting choice.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:35.260]   The Pogo pins for the keyboard are in a different place now.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.580]   They're now kind of attached to the back of it.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.940]   There's a little magnetic cube.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:46.100]   There's a magnet on the side of it so you can actually see where the new pencil clips into
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.980]   and the pencil snaps onto that really, really tightly so it doesn't feel like it's going
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.140]   to fall off any time.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:58.460]   Overall, just as a shape, I just really, really liked it a lot, not just for the weight of
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:03.980]   it, but just the way that it sits on a desk, the way that you sort of sits in your hand.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.380]   The new pencil is 10 times more than fabulous in terms of, or at least for the 20 minutes
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.380]   I was playing with it.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:15.340]   So in the video, we're reading tea leaves here.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.060]   So I want to get your input.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.560]   In the videos you can see here on the edge, on the bottom edge, there's something that
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.460]   looks like, I don't know what, an SD card slot.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.220]   That's not the magnet.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.220]   That's a magnet.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.220]   And is that the top?
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.860]   So that's the magnet for the pencil.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   Is that what that is?
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.860]   Right.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.980]   The pencil, not only does it, not only does it click in there, but it will also do wireless
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.220]   charging once it's magnetized in there.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.220]   It's really cool.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:46.580]   Once you click it on top there, it actually, from that edge of the screen, a little indicator
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:52.620]   sort of drops down, like Apple Pencil, battery level 62%, or whatever, and then silently rolls
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.140]   back up again.
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.820]   I really like that.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:00.940]   I never thought it was aesthetically pleasing to stick the pencil into the lightning port.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.780]   It was such a bad idea.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.780]   Such a bad idea.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.580]   Like it was going to break instantly.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.100]   I'm sure some people had accidentally broken it off.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.100]   Of course.
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.100]   There's no way that wouldn't have to.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:17.580]   It also means we've eliminated the easily lost cap to protect the lightning connector.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.580]   Thank goodness.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:25.900]   Everything about it is just, even if all they did to update this pencil was number one,
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:31.700]   get rid of that cap, number two, flatten one side of it so that it no longer rolls off
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.300]   the table, which is another thing that it does.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.380]   Also, it's no longer glossy.
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:42.380]   It's sort of like a satiny, I wouldn't say rough, but it's not a glossy sort of feel
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.380]   to it.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.140]   I'm just saying out there in fact that now it is the size of a pencil.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:51.700]   It isn't this weird, super long shape that you can't stick in any pen holder that's inside
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.700]   your laptop bag.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.260]   It's sticking out like an aerial antenna.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.660]   Just all these things feel so good in the hand.
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.460]   The fact that you now have a tapable area on it.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:06.100]   It'll just make it so much more fun and so much more easy to use.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.500]   How do you like the screen?
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.860]   The iPad, it's absolutely solid.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:17.260]   I really couldn't see any difference between this screen and the screen that I've been
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.900]   using for the past couple of years.
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:26.660]   I think that I don't know what you'd have to do to make a panel like that look bad.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.060]   It certainly looked perfectly fine to me.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.100]   Bezzles, did that make it feel like it was all screen?
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.620]   It's not quite all screen.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:39.860]   I was going to bring that up when you were talking about the Huawei device.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.860]   I think that you need to have a little bit of bezel there because not only are you going
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:49.340]   to be holding it, but at some point you have to reach over and pick it up.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.820]   Giving you a visible safe zone is just reassuring.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.220]   It just makes absolute sense.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.620]   How much is the bezel?
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.020]   How much is it?
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.620]   Half an inch or three quarters of an inch?
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:07.220]   I would say about a half an inch.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.940]   A little bit less than that.
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.460]   So then the bottom doesn't have pogo pins anymore.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.940]   It looks like a microphone.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.540]   It's got a presumably ray mics for Siri.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.740]   So you said the pogo pins are on the back now.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.940]   It's on the back surface on the bottom.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:25.940]   The smart connector.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:28.260]   The smart connector for the good word.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.100]   We're going to have to redesign those anyway for a different form factor, but now you'll
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.660]   have to absolutely have to have a different...
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.780]   It really does.
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:43.420]   I had no complaints ever about having a home button on my iPad Pro, but now that I think
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:49.900]   even more than on the new iPhones, taking it off of the iPad just seems like such a brutally
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:55.300]   honest and simple and natural thing to happen because now you just have nothing but screen.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.900]   You have nothing but user interface.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.740]   You have nothing but content.
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.260]   And it looks pretty nice.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:06.780]   They're doing, of course, the true tone as they did before with the iPad Pros and TrueMotion
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.180]   120 frame per second.
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:12.980]   In fact, they showed Assassin's Creed rebellion with 120 frame per second.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.180]   Not all games will do that, but that one did.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.940]   And they had to have a little bezel because they've got a face ID camera.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:26.900]   Is this in the portrait edge, the short edge of it?
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:32.260]   It would be the opposite side of the USB C port, I believe.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.260]   Okay.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.780]   So if you want to call that the top, but it will work in a portrait.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:37.780]   What is the top?
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:44.820]   And that's what's cool is they had said with the iPhone, "Oh, we can't do vertical orientation
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.260]   or horizontal orientation.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.260]   Now they can.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.220]   Now it doesn't matter how you hold the iPad."
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:54.660]   And everybody tells you how they were able to make that work in iPad Pro versus why they
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.660]   couldn't make that work in iPhone.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:57.660]   Nope.
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.660]   It's the age of all black acts, bionic.
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:01.660]   Yeah, right.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.140]   I can't wait to find out the details.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.140]   Did you try it Andy?
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.140]   Did you try it from all the different orientations?
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:12.020]   I do not try face unlock and they weren't offering to have someone who had to train for
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.260]   it to do it.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.300]   So I'm sure it works.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:22.300]   But it seems to work pretty okay the way that it goes.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:27.340]   I was actually a little intrigued that the iPad Pro had Face ID, but the MacBook Air
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.340]   did not.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:32.140]   They, you know, they're the same thing with like, "Oh, the bezel gets really small and
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.860]   you're thinking, 'Oh, is there room up there for a camera?'
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:34.860]   And then yes, there is.
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:38.100]   They've got the FaceTime camera on the MacBook Air.
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:45.100]   But clearly again, Face ID, not the thing they're necessarily going for everywhere.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.100]   Yeah, they had it touch ID.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.100]   Right.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:52.260]   And if you're adding Face ID, then you're charging another $100 for the MacBook Air,
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.900]   which people are already complaining about the price.
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:57.740]   So I'm sure that had something to do with why they decided not to do that technology.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.780]   Oh, go the iPad Pro again.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.820]   The price there is actually pretty cheap.
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:06.180]   And those, you know, I was expecting those to be more expensive than they ended up.
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.540]   So I wonder what the future of Apple, I'm going to say it again.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.300]   I just charge more.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:17.620]   Well, I'm just $7.99 for the 11-inch based on 64 gigs of storage.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.580]   By the way, no more $32 gig scale.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.580]   Thank God.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.140]   $12.9 inches will start at $9.99.
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.500]   And of course, if you decide you want to get more storage, you can.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:35.180]   Silver in space, gray, the storage choices range from 64 gig, all the way up to a terabyte.
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:39.900]   Again, you know, we're getting more and more PC-like on these things.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:43.100]   Really, you know, they say faster than most laptops.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.340]   You've got a lot of storage.
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.180]   Even though we put them in the data center.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:53.340]   Even the way Apple designed the page that you're looking at is more similar to the way
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:57.700]   purchasing a MacBook or a MacBook Pro or a MacBook Air looked.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:01.580]   As soon as I clicked on that page, I almost for half a second thought, did I accidentally
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.900]   click on one of the MacBook pages?
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:03.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:06.340]   Because even the way they designed the page looks different.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:13.180]   Wi-Fi plus cellular, a premium of $150 now for a cellular used to be $129.
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:16.820]   And then Apple care, of course, you always want to get that.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.300]   What's in the box?
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.260]   A Type C charging cable.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:21.260]   They show one end.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.740]   I presume the other end.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.460]   There's no power adapter in the box?
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.620]   No, there's 18 watt USB-C power.
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.620]   Oh, there it is.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.460]   It would probably be USB-C to USB-C.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:36.660]   18 watt USB-C, there you go.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.540]   And big, big bonus, this is one of the coolest things you can do with USB-C.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.660]   You can actually use the iPad to charge your phone.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.660]   So it's got this big Wamp and battery in it.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:49.700]   When you plug in a rechargeable device that knows how to do that with USB-C.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:50.700]   Two-way charging.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.180]   I love that.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:53.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.180]   So, yeah.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.620]   It's like you're carrying this huge battery charger anyway.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.620]   I might as well.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:02.260]   So why not move some of those electrons where they can actually make you some money?
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:07.700]   Would you ask if you could use a USB-C for a monitor or for an eGPU or other devices?
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.700]   What can that USB-C port do?
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.340]   It can be used for a monitor.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.060]   I didn't ask for eGPU.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.660]   I don't, I would guess no.
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.140]   I actually didn't even bother asking.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.140]   Yeah, I bet not.
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:18.140]   That's for Intel.
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.140]   I would definitely be supportive.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.980]   But they did say that you can use it for extra to monitor.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:28.100]   It's actually, it's weird that you've got to give Apple a little bit of credit given
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:34.060]   that now you can just have a simple cable that connects your camera, for instance, to
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.060]   your iPad.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:42.060]   iPad Pro, they've made the first dondolas device that's in the lineup for the past like 10
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.060]   years.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.740]   You can't leave the house without a dondole if you've got a backbook, but you've got
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:47.780]   an iPad if you just got a camera cable.
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.980]   It's just got a cable with the connectors of both ends.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:51.980]   You're good.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.980]   That's a good point.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.380]   Ray, microphones, speakers in all four corners.
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:01.780]   They said, "Tweeter and woofer in all four corners."
[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:02.780]   Did you hear it?
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.780]   Did you try the sound?
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.420]   It is noticeably different.
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.860]   That was really, really loud.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:07.860]   It was really, really loud.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.860]   It's tough.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:09.860]   That's hot.
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:10.860]   It also was like reverberation.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.220]   I did play something, but I really didn't notice.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.220]   You can't.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   I can't tell.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:19.660]   So my question is with the external monitor is what happens?
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:25.540]   Is it just mirroring or do the apps somehow get to control what the external display is
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:26.540]   used for?
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.940]   Obviously, you can't just touch the monitor.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.900]   I would assume that it would work exactly the same way as when you've got external VGA
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.780]   or HDMI connector on an existing iPad.
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:42.380]   There's some apps that will treat it like a keynote treats that as a separate display
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.620]   with the user base on the regular panel.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.060]   I think they're video editors.
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.580]   I believe we use that for playback.
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.340]   They're different solutions for it.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:55.300]   You know, though, that duet and other external monitor solutions with the iPads stopped working
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.300]   fairly recently.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.420]   I wonder if there'll be a duet like capability, which would allow me to use my iPad as a second
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:03.740]   display for a MacBook.
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.740]   That would be an interesting thing.
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.340]   It would need some sort of Apple.
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:09.260]   You hook it up to your USB-C.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:10.260]   What happened?
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.260]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.260]   That's the problem with USB-C.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.260]   You'd never know.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.260]   Well, maybe you would think.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:16.260]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.260]   True, I think.
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.260]   No.
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.260]   That definitely won't work.
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.260]   No.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:26.220]   It would be super wonderful if you could plug this iPad in and use it as an external display.
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:32.420]   It would be doubly cool if there was an API so that Adobe could basically project, extend
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:38.060]   the user and a touch user, a touch interface for Photoshop, mix and blend colors, or even
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:41.020]   just use it as a wack-and-tablet with the Apple Pencil.
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.980]   Were you blown away by that Photoshop demo, man, the way that she was scrolling through
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:49.220]   layers than the augmented reality with Arrow?
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:54.660]   That's another measure of how much desktop power this has.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:55:06.100]   Especially, they had 2K sports doing a demo of the NBA 2K game where it's like you see
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:10.660]   an arena full of people and they're not just a painting of people in mid-clap.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.060]   They're people who are actually standing up and cheering.
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:15.500]   Every fan different, they said.
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:25.740]   And not only are these players almost outside of uncanny value, they're just climbing their
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:29.420]   way up out of it because they're so close to being realistic.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:36.340]   But nonetheless, to give them more credit, you look at the texture of the wood on the
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:42.220]   basketball court where it's shiny, like a varnished wood, but it also has that sort of
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:46.300]   texture of a gameplay service on it.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.660]   And this is all being driven from an iPad.
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:54.420]   And this is me just simply repeating a marketing thing that the marketing person during this
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.780]   marketing event said during the demo.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:01.020]   But he said that this is a performance that we were unable to get on any other mobile
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.020]   platform.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.900]   This is truly console level performance.
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:08.140]   And I will simply say, looking at it in front of me, I absolutely believe it.
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.140]   Yeah, they compared it to the Xbox One.
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:14.740]   Yeah, I was just going to say that.
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:20.580]   Well, but it's interesting because Apple and the iPhone particularly, but has really become
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.860]   the king of casual gaming.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:26.860]   But this is taking on the king of hardcore gaming.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:30.380]   And I think it might be, I mean, they've got the power.
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:31.380]   They've got the screen.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:37.900]   Although, as was discussed in our community was still no controller, you're still on a
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:38.900]   cloud screen.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.900]   Well, you could use it.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.140]   Well, that's the question, a USB C controller.
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.500]   Will that will that will that will?
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:48.580]   Well, there are made for there are my made for iPhone to Bluetooth controllers.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:53.180]   There are Bluetooth isn't quite as there's an issue of lag.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.660]   The latency might actually be an effective though.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:57:06.580]   There are some fantastic quality USB or sorry, Bluetooth gaming pads that that are game gamer
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:07.580]   level.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.180]   So, you know, there's a possibility.
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:14.660]   I would argue though, and I hope that the gamers out there don't hate me for this.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:18.500]   I don't think this is ever going to I don't think the iPad will ever be a gamer, a gamer
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:19.500]   device.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.940]   It just it's not a dedicated gaming device.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:23.940]   It's an iPad.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:24.940]   Come on.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.940]   It's a lot of it.
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.740]   It competes with the switch at this point, right?
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.820]   Which would you rather play Fortnite on?
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:34.780]   It competes, but I don't see a lot of game developers spending the time necessary to turn
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:39.700]   their, you know, their top tier games into gaming.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:43.420]   Fortnite makes a million dollars a day on iPhone and iPad.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.420]   Yeah, there are.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:55.420]   I think there's some incentive and and and Minecraft is another huge money making game.
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:58:00.780]   But these are these are we're not talking about red dead redemption to here that I don't
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:06.580]   think game companies are going to spend a lot of time porting these these really big,
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.540]   really advanced games onto the iPad.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:14.700]   And therefore, I don't think the iPad is ever going to really make a name as being a gaming
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.700]   console.
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.300]   It will be it'll be an iPad.
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:23.460]   It already is a tablet that you can do amazing gaming on, but it will never become a replacement
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:26.620]   for your Xbox or your PlayStation or something like that.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.620]   I really don't think that's the case.
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:36.860]   Yeah, I think that's a great point because it was impressive demo just showing exactly
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:41.820]   how quickly this machine could render this these graphics and put them on the screen
[00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:44.060]   and do them do so interactively.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:49.620]   The question is the people who really, really want that level of performance, do they want
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:54.620]   to do it on a machine that they hold up like this and do like that with or do they want
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:57.620]   that to be on their big 4K display in the middle of a living room.
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:01.700]   Do they want to be able to do it with their friends in the room or do they want to be
[00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:05.420]   able to do it with network connectivity as opposed to just sitting on the subway with
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:08.340]   the right, that pro working with it that way.
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.100]   But the level of performance that it was least demonstrating in all of this between
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:17.700]   the Photoshop demo and the game demo was it's just nothing like what you're getting for
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:23.780]   the same amount of money or even more money in the Windows tablets case.
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.700]   I think it might surprise you.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:34.580]   A couple of times I would be the last person to bet against AAA gaming on an iPad.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.580]   But we'll see.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:40.700]   You're right, Laurie, if the developers don't do it, then it's not going to happen.
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:46.140]   But I think the form factor objections can be overcome as mobile and it's portable.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.340]   The DS sells quite well.
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:50.340]   Sure does.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:55.340]   But it is a bespoke device.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:58.700]   You get the controllers built into it and it's a really cool form.
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.740]   I think the controllers are going to be the thing.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:06.780]   And that Type-C port is incredibly capable and much more capable than the lightning port,
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.980]   much more universal in the lightning port.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:13.580]   I could see no reason why you wouldn't see Type-C based controllers.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.500]   It's going to be so cool to see what kind of hardware comes out when people don't have
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.660]   the Cautau to license this special proprietary connector.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.660]   Yes.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:26.660]   And they can just simply create a USB device, a USB-C device that will just fit into that
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.660]   plug.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.660]   You already brought up.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:32.300]   You could connect it right to your camera.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.540]   Although I don't see a lot of cameras with Type-C yet, but I imagine they'll all have
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.540]   Type-C down the road.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:41.820]   Well, but you get a matter of fact in my bag right now, I've got a Type-C to micro USB.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.820]   That's true.
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.540]   So I can put this up to my camera.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.620]   It's just cool to be have.
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.180]   And it's just really cool to have one cable.
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.460]   I have to plug it into an adapter, plug the adapter into this because sooner or later
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.660]   that an adapter is going to go missing.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:01:00.620]   But I have less likelihood of losing that one cable that I need.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:06.980]   I thought it was interesting that it sounds like they've put a pretty good camera itself
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:07.980]   into this.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.140]   They're mentioning smart HDR.
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.540]   It's F1.8.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:21.260]   I don't know if this is the same as the iPhone XS wide angle, but it sure seems pretty close.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.300]   And wasn't the neural engine part of the way they got HDR?
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.300]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.780]   And they have quite a hefty neural engine in the Bionic A12X.
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:31.540]   You could tell the picture it was a big neural engine.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.780]   Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:38.820]   It was bigger than the CPU it looked like in the cross-section.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.340]   4K video recording at 60 frames a second.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.260]   I have slow-mo support for 1080p.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.860]   It's 120 frames, 720p.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.660]   It's 240 frames.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.460]   Cinematic video stabilization.
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.860]   I don't know what that means.
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:57.500]   That sounds like it's software-based.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.660]   Autofocus video.
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.020]   Do you know, Andy, is this the same camera as in the iPhone?
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.980]   I was told that it wasn't a big improvement.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:13.700]   It was substantially the same as what Apple has put into other current iPhones.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:18.380]   When I was mostly talking about why is there about camera bump now?
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.340]   Because you've done something that's substantially different.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.500]   Is there something, a next generation, anything?
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:29.380]   And I was told that, no, it was basically how they could get what they needed to do
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:33.060]   to get the camera that they were going to put in anyway into that form.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.540]   It looks just like a camera bump on my iPhone.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.820]   It's a big work.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:40.820]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.820]   This is a 10R.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.100]   It looks the same on that 10R.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:50.260]   The only drawback is that you, I guess you can't lie your iPad down flat anymore.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.660]   I don't know if that's a problem though.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.820]   How many times do you have the, I can't think of a time where I had the thing flat on
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:01.620]   a table and was actually interacting with it as opposed to it's there because I put
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:04.300]   it down and I'm going to pick that later.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.820]   How does the smart keyboard folio intersect with the camera?
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.820]   Must have a cutout.
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:10.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.820]   Didn't it cover the back?
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:16.260]   No, well, it's a folio sort of thing.
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:20.900]   And so it disconnects magnetically with the four logo pins in the back.
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.980]   So it's not going to cover up on the back of the camera.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.860]   Because it's a nice big hole.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:29.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:30.860]   Okay.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:31.860]   So that will be your flat part way.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.860]   That's right.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:33.860]   That should lie flat.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:39.180]   I immediately ordered the folio so that I'd have front and back protection in a keyboard.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.340]   And that I'll tell you what, you add that I'm not talking about price.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:47.580]   Let's let's ignore price for the moment, but you add that I feel like that iPad pro,
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:48.980]   especially the 12.9.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:52.060]   You got a laptop computer now.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:56.180]   So, so will you be able to plug a mouse into your USB C?
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.340]   Good question.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:58.340]   Why not?
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.340]   What happens?
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.140]   The drivers obviously.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.780]   Yeah, whether Apple puts drivers.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.940]   Do you need a mouse though with touch?
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:13.420]   You know, it's one of the reasons why I got this, this pixel book C is because I kind
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:19.980]   of wanted to play some more with a mobile operating system that's truly within like
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:23.740]   a laptop form factor just like this.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:29.020]   And I do have to say that there are times where you really are in laptop sort of work
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.020]   mode.
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:36.180]   And I love the, but my Logitech K811 keyboard that I usually travel with, but it's not the
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:41.060]   same as simply being able to open it up, put on the table and start going.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:46.140]   It's it's taken out of the bag, take of my folding stand out of the bag and unfold it,
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:51.300]   press a button so that Bluetooth will find it and connect to it automatically.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:55.620]   And the ability to never have to reach up to a screen to touch when you don't want to
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.940]   and simply always have a track pattern, these two from.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:02.980]   That's what lets you easily more easily get through eight hours worth of work with the
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.780]   keyboard than I could with with an iPad.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:12.460]   But it's again, but this isn't a Chrome, Chrome book, it isn't Windows 10, it is an iPad.
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:18.860]   And for the quality of the software library you're getting in the iPad, that's not a huge
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.860]   tradeoff.
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.900]   I mean, it's not, it's you're not going to miss it.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:28.580]   We're asked if I've only used this for about a week and I could, my Macbook Pro is broken.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:33.060]   So I have to do a whole bunch of stuff to like get this being a Sky King and using this
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.300]   for notes.
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:39.140]   And I could have just taken this, taken this Chromebook with me because it does have Skype.
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:44.340]   But the version of Skype is sort of this weak version that really doesn't do very much,
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.340]   but so ever.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:49.300]   So I could plug a, I could plug a microphone into it, but I couldn't actually control it
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.300]   or use it.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:55.260]   Whereas I could have actually just taken my iPad Pro and used that because that will, that
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:59.140]   will support external microphones and the software that's written for it is of such a
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:05.420]   professional standard that it really does try to be as good as a desktop equivalent.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.740]   You just can't get, you absolutely can't get that in Chrome unless you to a large extent
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.540]   can't even get it on Windows.
[01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:16.740]   You have to start treating this Windows tablet as though it's a Windows laptop to get that
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.420]   kind of software library.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:25.220]   So Apple is absolutely 100% on the mark when they are marketing this $1,000 tablet.
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:29.940]   That is the equivalent of a $1,000 Windows laptop or $1,000 Microsoft Surface device.
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:34.780]   Because it's because of the quality of the software that you can get the absolutely the
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:39.380]   best professional mobile library you can get anywhere.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:51.660]   I feel like that if you got the folio, it's very, you're opening up, there's a keyboard.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:59.420]   Now it doesn't have a trackpad, but isn't it the case that you can smoosh the keys?
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.860]   Am I wrong and use it as a trackpad?
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.700]   I like the idea that you're just smoosh the keys to make that happen.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.460]   You can with the on-screen keyboard.
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.540]   If you press and hold on the on-screen keyboard, it becomes a trackpad.
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.260]   I think it's the same with the physical keyboard.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.260]   I might be wrong.
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:16.340]   I've noticed that on the old one anyway.
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.340]   I might be wrong on that.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.940]   There are a lot of keyboard, short cuts and keyboard commands to navigate a cursor throughout
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:22.940]   a text field.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:25.700]   So it's not as though you're always reaching out to text.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:26.700]   Apparently.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:27.700]   I know exactly what you mean though, Andy.
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:31.900]   I can't count the amount of times where I was using my iPad Pro 12.9 inch.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:36.620]   It feels if you have the right keyboard, especially, it really feels like you're using a MacBook.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:40.060]   And I would try to use a trackpad that's not there.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:41.060]   Oh, that's right.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.060]   And I'd have to reach up.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.060]   Your brain is just working in that capacity.
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:49.460]   I mean, a trackpad keyboard for an iPad would be fantastic.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.100]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.100]   Yes.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.100]   And then...
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.140]   And also, this is this matter here.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:00.580]   I couldn't have possibly sat in the Opera House with something in my lap and typed and
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.540]   typed and typed for an hour and a half.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:07.780]   I've tried to do that with folding iPad keyboards like the one that you just bought.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:12.820]   But at some point, you just adjust your shin a little bit and it collapses.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:16.180]   And the keyboard starts bending in a really, really weird way.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.380]   So you'd have to bet...
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:18.380]   You'd have to get that really cool.
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:23.100]   But the same thing that keyboard that has the beautiful flat...
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.260]   Almost a woman of flat platter with two hinge mounting...
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.740]   Oh, the bridge.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.220]   The bridge keyboard.
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.220]   That's the one...
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:34.900]   Yeah, I use the bridge keyboard with my 12.9 inch just because it actually makes it feel
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.540]   like a MacBook.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:40.180]   And it doesn't fall over as soon as you shift.
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.500]   A lot of little details.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.500]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.660]   I don't really work for a living, so I can't...
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:49.660]   I don't know.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.380]   But I feel like that...
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.380]   I certainly...
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:56.620]   And I have a Surface Go with a little Surface.
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:02.540]   Given the choice going out the door between a Surface Go and an iPad Pro, I'd pick the iPad
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.340]   Pro every single time.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.340]   Absolutely.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.460]   And that has a...
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.700]   Surface Go has a trackpad.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.500]   Yeah, I wonder what...
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:12.500]   No trackpad there.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   Well, I guess there's no mouse pointer, so a trackpad would be a lot of use.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.740]   The comment that I heard also from some people is they just feel like they have fat fingers.
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.620]   And for certain kinds of things you need...
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.620]   You need pretty precise positioning.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.180]   That's what the pencil's for.
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:33.180]   Yeah, so I have a 10.5 inch iPad Pro with pencil and a keyboard, smart keyboard.
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.180]   Never use the pencil.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.180]   It just doesn't happen.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.780]   Sort of a nice idea, but it doesn't happen.
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:39.660]   That's why I've never lost my pencil or the pencil cap.
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.660]   It's safely ensconced.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:43.900]   But it's never going to get used.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:48.540]   I will say the smart keyboard, and I'm presuming the new smart keyboard folio and look very
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.940]   similar, is surprisingly good.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:53.180]   I'm a bit of a keyboard snob.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:59.900]   And I think that Apple did a shockingly good job with what is a funny keyboard, frankly,
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.340]   with the textured keys and everything like that.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.620]   And it holds really well.
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:10.820]   I mean, it's not as solid as a MacBook would, but I've never really had a trouble using
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.820]   it.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.860]   Well, little I do on a lap.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:19.980]   I frankly mostly don't work in my lap because I'm not a big fan of the ergonomics there.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:26.820]   One advantage a Surface has is the smart keyboard and all the keyboards for iPads have one angle
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:27.820]   of incidence.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:28.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:29.820]   Let's just do now.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:30.820]   This has two?
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.820]   Yeah, this has two.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:34.260]   They showed very specifically you got two.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.260]   Good.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.060]   You can see right here, it says two viewing angles.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.060]   That's good.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.140]   You notice that font.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.660]   Wait, look at the two viewing angles.
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.660]   Yeah, what is the return of a comic sans?
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:46.660]   Marker felt.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:47.660]   Oh, it's Marker felt.
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:51.380]   I don't know what we were debating that, but all of their slides during the presentation
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.380]   used that.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.740]   I think that's a funny font.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:54.740]   It's hard to read too.
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:59.420]   It's not a good choice, but I guess it makes it more human scale maybe.
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.140]   Looks like handwriting, doesn't it?
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:06.100]   It's funny how Apple just does stuff like that.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.020]   And then we all have a, what does that mean?
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.020]   What could that mean?
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.020]   Why is it?
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.020]   Marker felt, but it's not Marker felt.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.540]   It's a criminal analogy.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:14.540]   Move to Cupertino.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:15.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.540]   Move to Cupertino.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:22.500]   That's a look who's on the wall waving when the tanks go by.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.820]   I am very excited.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.980]   I think these iPads, I'm particularly interested in the power in these iPads.
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:35.460]   I really feel like Apple is, this is where all the R&D is going, folks.
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:40.940]   Look at the MacBook Air and look at the iPad Pro.
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.300]   Where is R&D going?
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.060]   You tell me.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:46.940]   Look at the Mac mini.
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:51.900]   You can put more air into that balloon than you can with the actual laptop, or even desktop
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.900]   operating system.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:57.140]   When you're writing, when you're creating everything to work together, the level performance
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.820]   you can get is astronomical.
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:04.220]   I can't wait to see six or seven months from now when we're seeing apps that really take
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.540]   advantage of all the power that are in the new iPads.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:13.100]   Again, already the greatest productivity suite, the professional suite, you can find
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.180]   any mobile device or any tablet.
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:19.540]   But once you have the developers saying, "You know that idea that we had that, boy,
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:24.420]   if Apple ever made a screening fast tablet that was this crazy stupid fast, way more
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:29.540]   stupid fast than anybody who just wants to read comic books and post to Facebook, whatever
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:33.860]   need," just what, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to build that app right now.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.860]   That was the conclusion.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:40.580]   A non-tech came to when they benchmarked the iPhone XS, is that this is really so much
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.300]   power, it's so much more than it needs.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.780]   This is about headroom.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:46.420]   This is about being able to handle a lot more.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:48.940]   I hope developers take advantage of that.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:53.380]   The reality is, there's not a lightweight task and they want to make it actually work
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.380]   really, really great.
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:55.740]   It's not just a tech demo.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:59.820]   This is going to be something that is going to be wired into so much of the user interface,
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.460]   so much of the experience.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:05.580]   It's not just creating great graphics that overlay on real reality.
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:10.700]   It's about being able to do so much math on the fly that makes sense of the scene and
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.660]   make sure they pick the position things correctly.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:18.860]   There is no more fascinating company than Apple when you see that this is not just really,
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.340]   really a fast computer.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.740]   It is a suspiciously fast computer.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:26.860]   That's a very good way to put it.
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:32.100]   RF 2020 says they dressed the Mac lineup just enough to look good at the funeral.
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.100]   Ooh.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.100]   Ouch.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.100]   That hurts.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.900]   Although I can't completely disagree.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.900]   All right.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:39.900]   Anything else to say about the event?
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:41.860]   There were no AirPods.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:45.940]   There was no PowerMat or whatever they're calling that thing.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.100]   No iMac.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.100]   No iMac.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.100]   No Mac Pro.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:53.740]   And did you get to actually play around with Apple Pencil?
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:56.740]   Tell us about the gesture.
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:00.020]   Tell me about the double tap.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.740]   That's what I want to know about.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:02.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:07.820]   There's only one area and it can be signed by the developer, but it's only a one tap
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.820]   area.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:11.780]   The developer cake created so that looks like two taps.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.580]   But the principal had it working in the notes app.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:18.660]   And so the way that was set up there was that I'm using the pencil and if I just tap
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.380]   that area, if I'm just...
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.980]   Of course I don't have a pencil with me.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:23.980]   But if you're...
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:26.620]   It's a place your forefinger would be right on the pencil.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:27.620]   Exactly.
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:33.980]   So if you just tap it exactly where your forefinger is going to fall, you see the tool bar of
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.980]   drawing tools at the bottom of the screen.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:38.540]   You see the eraser tool just sort of like leap up.
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:42.620]   Just gently like rise up and then go back down again to let you know that okay now you're
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:44.860]   using the pencil is now the eraser.
[01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:47.660]   And so you know you can just erase what you want to do and then tap it again and get the
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.500]   pencil back.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:51.460]   It's such a natural thing.
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:55.140]   You would think that you would worry that maybe it's going to be hard for me to make
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:58.460]   sure that I'm tapping the right place because it's not marked.
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:04.020]   There's not like a little like a little different texture to let you know.
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:07.100]   But it's pretty much exactly where your finger would fall.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.540]   I've never failed to do it.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:14.500]   Realize that this isn't shaped like a pencil where it's like a hexagon or an octagon.
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.460]   There really is only one flat side to it.
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:21.300]   If you just tap that flat side which is where you're going to be holding it anyway, you'll
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.300]   get it.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:26.780]   But the most interesting thing is that developers can do whatever they want with that tap gesture.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:29.700]   So you're probably going to see a lot of cool stuff happening there.
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.700]   I love everything about the Apple pencil.
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:36.260]   I just wish that we're going to be compatible with previous versions of the iPad.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.260]   So that's my question.
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:40.020]   Is there forward or backward compatibility?
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.180]   Can use an old Apple pencil on the new iPad Pro?
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:44.500]   I think they said that or they said that.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.500]   I didn't hear.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.740]   You could use the new pencil on the old iPad.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.780]   I think they said.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.700]   Charging is just a big issue.
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.380]   Yeah, you can't charge it.
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:56.380]   It's wireless charging.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:57.380]   It's not sheer.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.380]   Is it?
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:59.380]   Maybe it is.
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.380]   I don't know.
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.380]   It's more than everything.
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.540]   It does say that you may have an old pencil that you don't really want to spend another
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:04.540]   hundred dollars on a new pencil.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.340]   You will know this on Wednesday because we want to know now.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.540]   I have a list of things to try.
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:10.540]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:15.460]   It's just a compatibility for the Apple pencil too that is compatible with the Apple pencil
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:18.140]   third generation 12.9 inch iPad Pro.
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:24.540]   So presumably that means it's also compatible with the 9.7 and 10.5 inch iPad Pro.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.820]   I mean, they've got the same technology on the inside.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:27.820]   Right.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:28.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:32.140]   Really everything about it and making it shorter to having a flat side so it doesn't roll
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:33.420]   off to the texture.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:37.940]   I hope that they at least redesigned the old Apple pencil so that we'll get a generation
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:42.140]   that will have at least just the flat side to it and this new texture to it because everything
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.460]   about it is just wonderful.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:46.420]   So you can now tilt for shading.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:50.020]   That was something that they couldn't do before.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:56.100]   So you can you've got pressure sensitivity and tilting and then they mentioned gestures
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:17:00.740]   and I don't know they've used the word gestures several times but I don't know what that means
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:06.100]   when it comes to and they don't seem to be saying what it means to the pencil.
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:11.500]   From what I was using, I believe I believe the referring to how ordinarily you're used
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:15.900]   to just using the pencil to draw lines in a container that's designed to accept lines.
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:20.700]   If you want to tap things with it, if you want to move things with it, if you want to
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.540]   interact with the user interface with it.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:28.780]   Like I've imagined that you will be able to, I didn't try this but from what they were
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:33.300]   talking to me about today and things I was trying of, I would imagine the first thing
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:38.460]   I would try is to see if I can bring in the app switcher just by moving the pencil into
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.460]   the right using it as my fingertip.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:46.460]   They also showed, I thought it was quite interesting using, I think it was Photoshop.
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:50.700]   If you touch, if you put your thumb on the screen, the pencil functionality changes.
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:53.100]   So without your thumb on the screen, it's drawing.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.820]   When you put your thumb on the screen, they dragged an object.
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.660]   So maybe that's what they mean.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:02.620]   Oh, yeah, it's a little bit weird.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:08.180]   Remember that the as much as I like keynote for the iPad, there's so many power moves
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:13.060]   that you can actually grab multiple things and sort of keep your thumb on one and sort
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:17.860]   of like pull other things off the screen into this pile and move it.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:21.940]   And that's just not naturally the way that I think of things.
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:27.820]   And that's, I wasn't unimpressed with a Photoshop demo, but it didn't look as though they completely
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:32.380]   rearticulated Photoshop into a brand new iPad context.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:42.620]   It does look like they gain Photoshop a new user interface that shows it feels like someone
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:49.980]   whose native language is mouses and trackpads who is trying to learn a tourist version of
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.300]   Don De Esta El Cuarto de Banyo when they go on vacation.
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:58.740]   Meaning it's effective, but it doesn't look like naturally what someone who is a developer
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:02.700]   of multi touch ops would create if they wanted to create something as powerful as Photoshop
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.540]   on the iPad.
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:10.060]   I hope it's not all about these and to do a copy of case, you simply get your thumb here.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:14.220]   You know, play version of Twister with your fingers left, left finger blue, right finger
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.940]   red and then twist like this.
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.580]   And then that's how you change the color palette.
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:22.540]   I think it's going to behoove us to spend some time.
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:28.220]   I maybe just kind of use the iPad Pro exclusively for a while to try to learn learn these new
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.220]   modalities.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:37.580]   I mean, you and I, Andy, come from an old school computer users and maybe young people just
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:38.580]   think of it differently.
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:42.060]   And maybe if we spend some time with it, we can learn a new way of behaving.
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:43.060]   I don't know.
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:48.060]   So I didn't forget my word star command key command.
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.380]   I use the Macbook.
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.380]   Control.
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:52.380]   Okay.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.380]   Yes.
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:54.380]   We'll never die.
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:55.380]   Let me tell you.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:00.020]   I'm a Jamf Nation user conference and they're a presentation by some high school teachers
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:05.260]   who are putting together a one-to-one iPad program largely to replace graphing calculators,
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.460]   which was a wonderful, wonderful thing.
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:10.300]   Old 1990s technology is still around.
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:13.620]   But our kids still has to buy an HP graphing calculator.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.620]   Precisely.
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.860]   Not anymore if you go to Sowanak High School in Long Island.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:20.180]   Any event.
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:24.420]   So the thing that the question came up of were they, you know, providing keyboards with
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.220]   all these iPads in the one-to-one.
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.420]   And they said, no, they weren't.
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:33.980]   And the guy says, like, basically, you know, you and I, adults, we all think the keyboard
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.180]   is absolutely essential.
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:36.660]   The kids don't care.
[01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:37.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:38.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.580]   They're splitting the, they're splitting the keyboard and thumb typing their essays.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.740]   And he's like, it drives us nuts, but that's what they're doing.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:44.740]   Wow.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.740]   So yeah.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.740]   Wow.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:51.700]   Let's take a break and unless there's anything else from the event, because I have other
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:57.860]   a Pope, a re of other Apple news to mention anything else from the event.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:01.420]   I think that the bottom line is great to see new stuff from Apple.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:08.340]   I was very gratified to see new Macs from Apple, but I think very clearly it's, it's
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:10.860]   clear where the future is from Apple's point of view.
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.340]   And it is not in Macintosh.
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:14.860]   Well, it's where their heart lies, I think.
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:15.860]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.460]   Also, it's nice to hear Lana Del Rey.
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:23.140]   It's been a while since we had a musical, a musical finale for, for Wendy's shows.
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.580]   So I, I, I'm an old person.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.500]   I didn't know who she was, but she sang.
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.420]   You don't know who Lana Del Rey is.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.980]   Hey, I actually know who Donna Lana Del Rey is.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:32.980]   It can't be that old.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:33.980]   Better for once.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.060]   I thought, I thought it was Dolores Del Rio for a minute.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.060]   That's all.
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:42.420]   I knew you'd be happy though that in the film at the beginning, they featured Dave Grohl
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:45.780]   using, using a Mac to, to work on music.
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:46.780]   Also, it's music.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.900]   And Linda, well, Miranda using an iPad.
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:50.900]   That's right.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:54.500]   And a bunch of other famous people actually.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:59.420]   They were, they were going by so fast I couldn't identify them all.
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:03.460]   So somebody just went to order an iPad Pro 11.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.620]   I love her in our chat room.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:08.420]   He says shipping is now November 16th.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:14.020]   So if you didn't get on the gravy train right away already, they're moving the shipping
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.420]   dates out by a little bit.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:19.860]   So they said, they said a lot of things and a lot of people were very excited to hear.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:20.860]   Apparently so.
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:22.020]   I'll take away from that.
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.020]   Apparently so.
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.540]   Yeah, I'm glad I got it right away.
[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:30.540]   I will have review units of fall of the above.
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:38.060]   The mini, the Mac book, Air, the iPad 11 and the iPad 12.9 Wednesday, as will anybody else
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.260]   who ordered right away.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:42.860]   And the rest of you will, you just have to wait a little bit.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:43.860]   Laurie Gill is here.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:45.340]   I'm more.com.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.780]   She's managing editor there.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:48.100]   Appaholic on the Twitter.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:50.740]   Low rate in the house.
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:56.220]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey guys.
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.380]   Also Mr. Andy Enoco from public radio and Boston, WGBH.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.180]   Oh, I threw you.
[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:03.660]   I threw you.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.660]   And now Adam.
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.900]   I'm like, what are you thinking?
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:06.900]   tidbits.
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:08.900]   Adam looks so damn buff.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:11.980]   I just hate you at running and running and running.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:19.060]   You do not have the belt problem that I and Andy have belts have failed us for so long
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:24.580]   by pants sliding down to our ankles at the most embarrassing moments or worse, hiked
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:28.380]   up to just below the nipple so that they'd stay.
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:33.860]   You need slide belts from bring Taylor the brand new rethink your belt belts.
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:36.180]   Here's the problem belts.
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:38.700]   Simply enough, they don't have enough holes.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:44.220]   They, you know, you got a few holes and if that's not an exact fit, well too bad.
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.700]   Slide belt solves that problem.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:46.780]   Here's a slide belt.
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.420]   This is a beautiful chrome twit buckle.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:51.300]   They have a variety of buckles.
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.780]   This is a vegan leather belt, but you can get canvas.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.380]   You can get hand tooled leather.
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:59.620]   You get a variety of different buckles.
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:01.260]   I'll show you antique brass.
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:02.740]   I'll show you the utility buckle.
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.180]   So you cut the belt if you want to shorten it.
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:06.180]   You put it in here.
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:07.180]   Here we go.
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.620]   I'm going to put it in the right way round.
[01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.500]   Otherwise the slide won't work.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.100]   I learned that through a hard experience.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.940]   So let's lock this into place.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:17.260]   Now we have a lovely belt.
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:22.020]   And by the way, that means it's very easy to change the belt, have one buckle that goes
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:23.020]   on different belts.
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.700]   It's kind of like an Apple watch in that respect.
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.220]   Now listen carefully.
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:33.300]   As I put on my slide belt, the beauty of the slide belt is the ratchet technology.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.300]   It's patented.
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:39.860]   It gives you an almost infinite variety of adjustments.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:42.060]   That's the sound I hear every morning.
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:48.020]   And then after dinner, when I want to loosen the belt, fortunately, that part is virtually
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:51.020]   silent.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.940]   Slide belt fits in 32 different ways.
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:58.500]   This is patented ratchet mechanism that makes it the most comfortable belt, the most effective
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.940]   belt you've ever had.
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:05.820]   You know, even somebody like you, Adam, who has no belly at all, I bet you also have no
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:10.420]   hips and so belts are sometimes a little bit challenging as well.
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:11.420]   Right?
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:12.420]   Yep.
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:13.820]   Here's the slide belt.
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:18.620]   This is kind of, I call this the Cubscap version with the antique brass buckle and the
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:19.620]   blue canvas.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:22.940]   They have a variety of styles and prices for everybody.
[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:26.220]   They also have narrow belts for women, which is great.
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:31.820]   Colorful belts for kids and for the outdoorsmen.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:34.620]   Here is the survival belt.
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:35.620]   Now, tactical belt.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.780]   It is basically the tactical belt.
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.380]   This is Andy's belt.
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:40.380]   So look at this buckle.
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:45.980]   By all appearances, a completely normal buckle except for the fact it has built in a very
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:50.420]   sharp, very useful night with a good point and bottle opener.
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:55.900]   It also has a flashlight and LED, very bright, by the way, LED flashlight.
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:56.900]   Look at that.
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.660]   And fire starter.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:05.580]   Okay, you're laughing, but when you're out in the woods and you need a fire starter,
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:09.620]   you need a flashlight, you need to be able to chop some kindling.
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:12.420]   You'll be glad to have your survival belt.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:13.420]   Actually, this belt.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:16.500]   Your belt off so your pants will fall down while you're doing this.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.940]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.540]   I didn't really think about that.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.540]   I probably wouldn't.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:25.180]   But if you're trying to survive, you don't care about your pants.
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.180]   That's right.
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:28.420]   Yeah, no, you make a good point.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.980]   You don't want to open the knife while your pants are on.
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.180]   That would be the flashlight.
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:34.180]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:35.420]   You can use the flashlight.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.260]   You just have to aim your waist.
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:41.900]   So the flashlight is removable so you can use it as you would.
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.140]   This is, I love this.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.860]   Actually, this would be a great groomsman's gift, right?
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:49.620]   If you've got a wedding party coming up, great holiday gifts too.

[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.060]   I love it.
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:08.220]   I have one that says "twit" on it.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:13.100]   So if I forget who I am, I could just look at my belt and go, "Oh, I'm a twit."
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.420]   Sidebelts are worn casually around the house at the office.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.940]   They're perfect for date night.
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:20.780]   A great travel belt because they're so easy to take off while going through security and
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:22.660]   so easy to put back on.

[01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:59.980]   I love these.

[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:12.020]   Slidebelts.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.020]   Don't worry.
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:14.020]   I can start a fire.
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.020]   A huge fire.
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:17.180]   Let me just get my belt off.
[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:22.340]   We're having some fun.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.340]   Let's see.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.780]   There actually was quite a bit of news.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:31.100]   Blackmagic took the occasion to announce an update to their Blackmagic eGPU.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:40.380]   Unfortunately, the eGPU that I purchased with the Radeon 560 is not upgradable.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:49.260]   But they have now announced a new eGPU with a much more powerful GPU and what a Vega RX.
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:51.900]   So that is a huge thing.
[01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:58.380]   It is the eGPU uses the Type-C connectors and works with all Mojave computers.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:05.260]   So it would presumably go with any of these new Macs, including the Mini and the MacBook
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:06.260]   Air.
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.340]   It's a Vega RX Vega 56.
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:12.340]   There's the name, the RX Vega's 56, which is apparently.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:18.700]   I'm not up on the Radeon graphics GPUs, but that's apparently a much better one.
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:20.300]   Adam, are you familiar with it?
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.300]   I am not.
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:26.060]   However, there was a tiny little mention slipped into Apple's PR, and I did notice this in
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:32.260]   the specs that the MacBook Pro 15 is now configurable with Radeon Pro Vegas.
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:33.260]   Ah!
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.260]   I just snuck that right in.
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:36.860]   A slipstream, some stuff in.
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:37.860]   That's good.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:44.740]   And it's obviously only the 15, but there was a Radeon Pro Vega 16 and 20, I think, or
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:45.740]   both options.
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:46.940]   I didn't get a chance to look at the prices.
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:49.700]   But just those people who really care about their GPUs.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:54.860]   The original version, they had the Radeon Pro 580, I'm sorry, it's a 560 that was in
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:57.580]   the laptop, the 580 in the EGPU.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.660]   It had 8GB of GDDR5.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.380]   That was 700 bucks.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:06.380]   The new EGPU Pro is a little more expensive.
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:07.380]   It's $1,200.
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:10.980]   It's MacBook Air cost $1,200.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:14.100]   But we'll work with any Thunderbolt 3 enabled Mac.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:19.540]   So we use the EGPU, but we use it more as a dock.
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:27.620]   Very handy for docking when I get to work docking my stuff in.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.620]   What else?
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:31.180]   I just closed the window.
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:34.260]   Let me reopen my window.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:42.940]   Not by the way that new EGPU Pro is not yet in stores, but apparently Blackmagic says soon.
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:45.260]   Do you didn't see anybody from Bloomberg at the event?
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:46.460]   Did you, Andy?
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:50.420]   Apparently they were uninsited.
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:54.180]   I did see a very suspicious looking horse.
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:31:00.060]   That's the way the lens that keeps sticking out of its mouth.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:03.220]   Retaliation for the Bloomberg Super Micro, a story.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:10.540]   Apparently Amazon pulled fourth quarter ads from Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:17.540]   And Apple, it's kind of a little less significant, did not invite them to the event.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:21.540]   But I know how that feels.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:26.300]   I don't feel punished.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:31.180]   It's like inviting share to your birthday party.
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:33.700]   She gets so many invitations.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:36.540]   Why bother her with the invitations you can't take?
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:38.020]   That's probably what they're thinking about you.
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.020]   I've had the iPhone.
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.020]   I'm just too busy.
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:43.700]   I've been on the XR since it came on Friday.
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:45.420]   This is the less expensive.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:51.100]   Some people are calling it the iPhone 9, the successor to the iPhone 8 that Apple never
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:52.100]   released.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.100]   It comes in six colors.
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:55.620]   This is, as you can see, a beautiful product red.
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:57.300]   I have to say, it's gorgeous.
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.300]   I love that color.
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:59.300]   Isn't it pretty?
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:00.300]   There's also a coral.
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:06.020]   There's a light blue, black, white, and a banana phone yellow, which I couldn't bring
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:09.740]   myself to buy, although I think who bought banana phone?
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:11.940]   What do we know about the banana phone?
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:15.140]   This is the-- you wanted the banana phone, didn't you, Laurie?
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.620]   I do want the banana.
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:19.420]   I already bought the tennis, though, so no banana phone for me.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:20.940]   But I love that color.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:21.940]   I do too.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:24.780]   Aluminum, not stainless.
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:28.100]   It's slippery, and with the glass back, inevitably you're going to put this in a case.
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:30.060]   So maybe the color doesn't matter all that much.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:34.620]   It's got the liquid retina display that Apple's put on the new iPad Pros, and frankly, very
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:41.500]   close in color rendition and quality to the OLED displays of the iPhone XS and XS Max.
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:42.580]   The size is interesting.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:46.660]   It's kind of halfway between the XS and XS Max.
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:51.620]   So it's-- for some, it might be the just right size.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:55.140]   You are giving up, besides the OLED screen, you're giving up the dual cameras you can
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.140]   see on the back.
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:57.140]   It only has one camera.
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:58.500]   It's kind of like an iPad.
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:02.860]   Has only one camera, which means you don't get the optical telephoto, the 2X, and you
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:06.940]   also don't get some of the additional features that the second lens provides.
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:12.380]   For instance, in portrait mode, I don't get the blackout version where you could take
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:14.940]   the background out entirely.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:18.220]   But the camera is still very good, and the front-facing camera is identical, so you could
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:22.820]   do all the same portrait stuff with the selfie cam.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:26.540]   At $750 for a 64 gig version, I thought this was pretty good.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:31.060]   I think a lot of people will-- I suspect a lot of people will choose a 10R as their
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:34.100]   2018 iPhone.
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.100]   I think it's a nice phone.
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:38.100]   No force touch.
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:41.460]   Yeah, it's sort of the perfect phone for almost everyone.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.460]   Right.
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:45.300]   Does anybody mind having force touch?
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:48.540]   Yeah, you know, I was talking with Renee about that.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:55.700]   He uses force touch a lot, so he specifically did feel like he was missing out on it.
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:34:06.180]   Most people, the 10R uses long press, and it has a haptic feedback for certain long press
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:09.340]   things, so it feels like you're force pressing.
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:13.420]   So you're kind of getting the same aesthetic by using it that way.
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:18.380]   Well, just to give you some sense, I've forgotten entirely that it didn't have 3D touch completely.
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:21.860]   Do you use trackpad mode when typing?
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:24.340]   That's the one thing I do with force touch on the 10.
[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:25.340]   Oh, let me see.
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:28.620]   You can press hard on the keyboard and you can trackpad mode.
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:30.060]   You can probably do a long press.
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:32.540]   I think you can press on the space bar, I think, now.
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:37.620]   Yeah, it doesn't do the long press doesn't work.
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:43.100]   Yeah, you have to-- yeah, OK, so it does work, but you have to long press the space bar.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:46.020]   With the haptic, it feels like almost like you pushed it in.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.300]   And now you have the trackpad mode.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:49.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:50.300]   So--
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.300]   Because that's the fat finger.
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.100]   For those who have fat fingers, that's the trick to get a cursor.
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:55.940]   It actually where you want it.
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:56.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.740]   I actually-- I do use that a lot.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   Again, I didn't even notice that it didn't have 3D touch.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:05.700]   It was like, oh, you're right, it doesn't.
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:09.260]   Because the haptics are strong enough that it kind of almost feels like something happened
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:10.260]   there.
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:13.660]   Anyway, I can't say any reason not to get this.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:16.820]   It probably has the longest battery of any iPhone.
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.140]   It's got the biggest battery of all the iPhones except for the 10S Max.
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:23.940]   And with a slightly smaller screen, it might actually get better battery life for the
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:24.940]   10S Max.
[01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:28.340]   So 3D touch is not force touch, OK?
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:33.500]   I don't know the difference, apparently.
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:34.500]   What else?
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:40.020]   See, Apple owes Qualcomm $7 billion according to Qualcomm.
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:43.300]   Good luck collecting that money.
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.500]   Here's a story from--
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:48.660]   You know, my next-door neighbor owes me $7 million, too.
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:49.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.660]   Good luck.
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:52.660]   7 million--
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:53.660]   And Apple has it on the couch anyway.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:54.660]   $1 billion.
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:55.660]   A billion.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:59.580]   I don't even want to get into this fight because it's just endless.
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:02.100]   So you could do your own research.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:05.020]   Visit your local public library kids.
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:08.020]   They're in the middle of a patent dispute, correct?
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:09.020]   Yes.
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:10.860]   I'm assuming that that's the situation.
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:12.620]   And this is such a funny analogy to use.
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:18.100]   But if you're having a dispute with your landlord, you're allowed to not pay rent until
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.820]   they fix the issue.
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:24.060]   But you have to be saving that rent money to pay it when it's time.
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:29.060]   And you have to show evidence that you actually are setting aside that money to pay it, even
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:31.220]   if you're not going to pay it until they fix it.
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:35.820]   I think when I first read this, that's immediately what I thought was, well, Apple's just-- they're
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:41.540]   just saving that rent money until this dispute is over to decide whether or not they have
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:42.540]   to pay it.
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:43.620]   But they're holding on to it.
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:45.340]   They just haven't paid it yet.
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:46.340]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.100]   Fair enough.
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:55.100]   Apple Watch had fall detection credited with saving a man in Sweden with a cute back pain.
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:57.980]   Oh, how did it solve the back pain?
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.620]   Gustavo, 34, suffered.
[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:03.540]   A sudden back injury fell paralyzed at the kitchen floor.
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.620]   It felt like someone-- I should do this in a Swedish accent.
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:10.220]   It felt like someone pushed an knife into my back.
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:12.060]   He says, "That's not a Swedish.
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:13.460]   I don't know what that is."
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.300]   Luckily, his watch responded.
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:20.100]   This is according to the Swedish publication Afton Bladet.
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.100]   This is the translation.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:25.820]   On Friday, Gustavo Rodriguez stood by the stove as usual and cooked food.
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:28.660]   Suddenly, he felt strange tension in his back.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.660]   It became increasingly difficult to move the body.
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:34.220]   Gustavo tried not to think about it.
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:37.780]   But today, I moved the fly and Japan, and it hit me.
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:41.460]   It felt like someone pushed a knife into my back.
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:43.740]   He felt terrible, Leo.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:44.740]   Knock it off.
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.500]   He felt the floor.
[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.740]   He came to the floor.
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:48.740]   He felt the floor.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.980]   The pain was so strong that everything went black.
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:52.700]   He could not move.
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:59.380]   Then the watch chimed and asked, "Do you want to call 1-1-2?"
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:02.900]   My apple vouch had sensed a fall, and vunder,
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:05.740]   if I should make an emergency call.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:08.740]   He said he managed to crawl across the floor to the living room
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:10.740]   and climb to the couch.
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:13.620]   But his-- I'm sorry, I started this.
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.620]   But his phone was in another room.
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:17.460]   He hadn't recovered from the pain yet.
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:20.460]   He managed to call his mother-in-law from the Apple Watch.
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:24.740]   So anyway, he didn't actually use the phone thing to call him
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:25.700]   emergency services.
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:27.700]   But he could have.
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.180]   He could have.
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:32.860]   Yeah, and he did use the Apple Watch to call someone in his family.
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:35.740]   It didn't call emergency services for him.
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:37.860]   But I mean, he had a back injury.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:40.020]   He didn't need emergency services.
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:42.180]   But he didn't have to crawl around on the floor
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:43.980]   finding his iPhone.
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.860]   He just used his Apple Watch to call his mom.
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:48.620]   Here is another story.
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:52.620]   Quick thinking Apple in turn uses Apple Watch as logging tool
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:55.820]   during in-flight emergency.
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:00.100]   So from central Michigan University comes a story of Brian
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.700]   Sheer.
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:04.420]   He was on a plane ride from Arizona to DC
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:06.540]   when soon after takeoff, the woman sitting in front of him
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:10.380]   passed out Sheer, along with an internal medicine physician
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:11.900]   in a lifeguard.
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:14.140]   Boy, she was on the right flight, jumped out of their seats
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:15.900]   and started working on her.
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:18.140]   Sheer pulled off his Apple Watch, put it on the woman
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:19.020]   to monitor her pulse.
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.860]   When the plane landed, he gave the watch
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:24.460]   to emergency technicians so doctors could have her pulse
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:26.580]   data from the flight.
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.460]   And here's the happy ending.
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:32.260]   That's when I decided that I want to go to medical school.
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.540]   I want to be the one using the latest technology
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:37.220]   and be a part of pushing it forward, not the one making
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:38.380]   and selling it.
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:43.420]   So he quit Apple and he started the CMU College of Medicine,
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:44.980]   interned at the Yale Cancer Center,
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:50.260]   and he created an e-book, a 56 page informational binder
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:53.380]   for brain tumor patients.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:55.020]   Happy, happy ending.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:56.020]   There he is.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:57.940]   There's Dr. Sheer, soon to be.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:02.860]   I don't know why the name on his coat says something else.
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:05.180]   But anyway, maybe borrow somebody's coat.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.580]   I don't know.
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:07.580]   That's good.
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:09.580]   It seems like he's got a different name.
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:13.100]   He's a trainee.
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:14.060]   Says trainee.
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.380]   That's it.
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:17.180]   So the first name's right.
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:19.100]   Anyway, OK.
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:22.100]   Good news from the copyright office.
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.780]   The-- maybe I'm a little punchy.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:26.300]   I have been here since 7 in the morning, right, Laurie?
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:27.700]   Yeah, I know.
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:30.660]   I've literally been working since 6.15 AM.
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:33.980]   I've been behind a computer working since 6.15.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:35.380]   Just enough time to get a cup of coffee.
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:36.180]   It's straight to work.
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:36.700]   Yep.
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:37.180]   Yep.
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:38.740]   I'm on my fourth.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:42.340]   Copyright office has-- thanks to good work
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:47.380]   from these folks right here, Soric of the Sidia Android
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:52.900]   Store, Cynthia Replogle and Kyle Wiens of I Fix It,
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:56.860]   a Corey Doctor O'Kitt Walsh and Catherine Trendicosta--
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:59.860]   I'm sorry, and Mitch Stoltz from the Electronic Frontier
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:01.020]   Foundation.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:05.900]   They prepared a long brief for the copyright board
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:12.140]   and, one, their final ruling released this week
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.700]   goes into effect immediately.
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:16.820]   It's OK to fix your phone, kids.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:19.180]   You can now jailbreak Alexa-powered hardware
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:21.540]   and other similar gadgets, vice assistant devices.
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:24.700]   You can unlock new phones, not just used ones.
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:27.100]   There is a general exemption from the Digital Millennium
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:27.820]   Copyright Act.
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.900]   Remember, the DMCA prevents reverse engineering copy
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:31.820]   protection.
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:34.420]   But now, with this exemption, you
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:39.580]   can repair smartphones, home appliances, home systems,
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:43.580]   or any other home device, or motorized land vehicles,
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:47.380]   but not your boat or airplane.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:49.060]   They better add car to that.
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:51.940]   Well, motorized land vehicles, that's a car?
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:52.780]   I don't know.
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:54.140]   I think they should add car to that.
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:56.300]   Maybe just to be specific.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.180]   Of course, it was John Deere tractor owners
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:00.460]   that were upset that John Deere wouldn't let them repair
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:02.140]   their own tractors.
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:04.140]   But you now have the right to do so.
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:06.180]   Furthermore, it's now legal for third parties
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:08.940]   to perform repairs on behalf of the owners.
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:12.620]   So this was a big, big ruling from the copyright office,
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:17.340]   meaning that the rules of the DMCA that prevent you
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:21.540]   from fixing stuff that is copy protected
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:26.140]   do not apply to those specific devices.
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.140]   Although the problem that still remains
[01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:31.260]   is just because you are allowed to, doesn't mean it's easy.
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:33.180]   Yeah, you still have to get the repair manuals
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.540]   and the parts, right?
[01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:37.020]   Well, you have to break the DRM in a lot of cases.
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:40.620]   You know, that doesn't seem that hard.
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:43.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:44.660]   You just download something from the internet.
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.260]   It's like there's people doing that.
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.220]   I don't know.
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:48.900]   I could be a little--
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.140]   A lot of these cool rulings are about exemptions
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:53.260]   to be able to break DRM.
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:55.820]   One of the more interesting ones was now
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:59.020]   if games that were like server-based games
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.140]   that you had to connect to a server in order to work,
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:05.140]   it is now not illegal to get those games running again.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.420]   But you can't--
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:09.420]   But all this conditional upon you finding a server
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:12.420]   that has the game on it is now no longer illegal to get
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:14.500]   that box running and put it back on the internet
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.900]   so that your client apps can play that game again.
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.020]   As long as you had it legally--
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.700]   But this is good for the internet archives.
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:25.500]   It has been archiving games that are no longer supported.
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:28.940]   It's one thing to get a ROM from Donkey Kong,
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:31.620]   but the stuff that needs a server and the servers are gone,
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:33.060]   that's a considerable challenge.
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:36.380]   And that actually is going to save things.
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:38.780]   When World of Warcraft is no longer playable
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:41.660]   because Blizzard doesn't run a server anymore in the year
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:45.460]   2028 or whatever, you'll still be able to--
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.420]   And I think it's important for historians.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:48.500]   Even it's art, right?
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:49.700]   It's a creation.
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:50.580]   Well, it's culture.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:53.340]   Imagine if it were impossible to ever play this--
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:56.460]   hear the song "8 Misbehaving" because the media--
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:59.380]   because the software that was required to play that song
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:02.580]   no longer exists on the CPU or the software is written for
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:03.260]   doesn't exist.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:05.460]   But you can emulate it so easily.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:09.540]   So that's why you're happy that the Library of Congress
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:11.820]   emphasis on the word library, that they're
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:15.020]   very, very partial to the idea of preserving culture
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.620]   and information and saying that they're
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:22.220]   applying the no harm done rule very, very liberally
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.620]   every time that they come up with one of these reviews.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.740]   So if you're going to complain that this game that you wrote
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:32.300]   in 1983 and having stopped supporting in 1986,
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:34.780]   that someone is creating an emulator that will let you run
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:36.660]   it and distribute it, you know what?
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:39.380]   You're going to have to just accept that there is no harm
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:40.900]   done by this.
[01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:43.940]   And you're just going to be happy that your work continues
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:44.820]   to live on.
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.100]   I apologize.
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:48.700]   There was one announcement at the event I didn't make mention
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:48.860]   of.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:51.060]   And that is that iOS 12.1 is out.
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:51.420]   Oh, right.
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:52.100]   Double it 1.
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:53.420]   We can now all install it.
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:55.940]   I installed it right after the event.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:00.700]   You can now FaceTime up to 32 people at once.
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:04.460]   That's why we had to buy the new Mac mini in '16.
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:07.740]   Apple also released 10, 14, 1.
[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:10.540]   Watch OS 5.1 and TDOS 12.1.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:12.940]   So that was didn't mention anything about those.
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:14.460]   All new OS--
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:16.220]   And the shortcuts have 2.1.
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:16.940]   The shortcuts have.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:17.820]   All kinds of new stuff.
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:18.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:19.140]   I'll get to that in a second.
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:21.540]   Let's just quickly mention that you now
[01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:25.660]   have a whole bunch of new emojis, 70 new emoji.
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:26.220]   Woohoo.
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:30.340]   Woohoo, including a properly conceived bagel,
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:32.460]   a cooked lobster as Andy is quick to point out,
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:38.500]   a ball of yarn, a lacrosse stick, and a mosquito.
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:43.460]   And I think also a lot of emoji of people with disabilities
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:44.500]   are also in this clip.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:45.500]   Yes, and that's really good.
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:46.860]   That's a mistake.
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:51.420]   There is a depth control now in your camera.
[01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:53.100]   So this is something they've showed before,
[01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:54.980]   but you can automatically adjust the depth of field
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:56.860]   in a real time preview.
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:00.100]   Used to be able to only do it after the fact,
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.540]   but I guess you can now do it while you're taking the camera.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:04.780]   That's cool.
[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:06.900]   Yeah, I like that idea.
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:08.740]   I usually adjust that afterward,
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:11.060]   but I like that you can kind of play with that
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:12.100]   before you would take the picture,
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:15.220]   make sure that this lighting is good and stuff like that.
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:22.100]   And your phone, your new phones, the 10S, 10S Max and iPhone,
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:25.140]   10R, have all had dual SIM support physically,
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:28.380]   but now the operating system also supports it.
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:31.020]   So that's good news.
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.580]   And as you mentioned, Shortcuts 2.1.
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:35.740]   Now this won't come with iOS 12.1.
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:37.180]   You'll have to download it.
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:38.820]   In fact, Shortcuts doesn't come with iOS,
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:41.380]   so go to the App Store if you don't already have it,
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:45.860]   install it, and it has a whole bunch of new things
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:47.500]   you can incorporate in Shortcuts,
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:50.500]   including get current weather, get current forecast,
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:54.020]   create alarm, toggle alarm, start timer,
[01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:58.300]   the new measurement and convert measurement actions.
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:01.660]   Get last import action for getting the most recent set
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:03.420]   of imported photos.
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:05.060]   So there's quite a few new features.
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:10.740]   I anticipate this will be a regular thing with Shortcuts.
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:14.260]   This is one maybe that's bit you that would be useful
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:19.980]   when running a shortcut from your HomePod using Siri.
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:22.020]   The media will now automatically play back
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:24.860]   from the HomePod using AirPlay.
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:28.540]   So for some of you, that's been a stopping point in Shortcuts.
[01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:29.780]   Shortcuts is great.
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:32.260]   Everybody play with it, use it, try it.
[01:47:32.260 --> 01:47:35.300]   And the easiest way to do that is to look at the Shortcuts
[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:36.500]   that your apps provide.
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:38.460]   Some apps do that in their settings.
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:41.180]   Sometimes it's in the Siri and Shortcuts setting
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:42.380]   in the Settings app.
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:46.420]   But boy, I've been doing all sorts of interesting things
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.540]   with the Shortcuts.
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:50.380]   In fact, I would like to recommend that you follow the
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:53.780]   shortcut subreddit on reddit.com.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:56.140]   Because there's, gosh, there's so many.
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:57.340]   And they've created a wiki there.
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:00.420]   There's so many useful shortcuts that you wouldn't even
[01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:03.900]   expect would be possible.
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:06.500]   And it's always fun to try new ones.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.540]   And it's actually not too hard.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:10.340]   Most of the time, what they do in this subreddit
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:13.020]   is they put their shortcuts on--
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:17.060]   I think I'm on the wrong one.
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:19.020]   It'd be shortcuts singular, right?
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:25.220]   Anyway, they put their shortcuts on Dropbox.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:28.140]   And then you can download it, which just makes it very easy.
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:32.020]   No, it's slash r slash shortcuts.
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.900]   Slash r slash shortcuts.
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:38.860]   Very, very good, I think very useful.
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:41.660]   All right, anything else to report?
[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:46.340]   Oh, missed a couple of big ones.
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:50.620]   Apple has been getting, reportedly, $3 billion a year
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:54.740]   from Google for making Google the default search engine for
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:58.220]   Safari on iOS and macOS devices.
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:03.540]   According to Business Insider, that number will rise to $12
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:07.940]   billion next year.
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:08.940]   That's a lot of money.
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:12.060]   That's a lot of cabbage.
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:13.140]   Google makes a lot, though.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:14.420]   They give me $12 billion.
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:15.380]   That's kept changing.
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:22.460]   It's clearly worth it with Apple's US market share in iOS.
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:28.740]   According to this analyst note, Apple users outpunch their
[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:30.780]   weight when it comes to how much they use Google and click
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.540]   on Search Ads.
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:35.260]   Of all Google Search Ads clicks in the third quarter,
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:37.580]   almost half came from iOS and macOS.
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:38.780]   This is according to Merpold.
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:40.180]   We're suckers for ads.
[01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:40.780]   Who knew?
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:44.260]   You guys love ads.
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:45.860]   $12 billion.
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.340]   Wow.
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:48.700]   Who knew?
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:52.740]   And the interesting thing is that in accounting, it all
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:54.460]   comes under services.
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:55.660]   So the next time you think they're a--
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:57.540]   Wow, they're cloud services.
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:49:59.700]   They're getting fast working.
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.300]   Well, no, there's a lot of ways of them making money.
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.260]   Services and what does that mean to the same?
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:05.780]   Yeah.
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:07.300]   But I say change in your god.
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:11.060]   If you change, no iPhone could credit to it.
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:13.900]   And finally, if you're looking for something to do with
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:19.900]   your cheese grater Mac, how about making a bench out of it?
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:21.900]   Stylish benches.
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.340]   Stylish benches.
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:25.340]   Can you use that in my backyard?
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:26.940]   It's good looking at--
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:28.260]   Do you use Fours for coffee tables?
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:31.300]   It's very solid, I might add.
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:32.980]   This is a designer named GTO.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:35.580]   He adds a slab of American black walnut that fits
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:38.580]   perfectly into the notch.
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:41.580]   He cuts a piece of work.
[01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:42.420]   I mean, let's face it.
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:43.860]   He cut a piece of work.
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:48.180]   Each bench is made to order lead time six weeks because they
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:52.220]   have to get G5 cases in the best possible condition.
[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:56.820]   $2,555 and the computers are non-functional.
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:57.380]   However--
[01:50:57.380 --> 01:51:01.060]   Do you get a discount if you donate your old G5?
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:03.460]   Ah, apparently not because there's only about $100
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:05.300]   for a G5 case on a bench.
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:06.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:08.460]   Oh, maybe it's the word that's that expensive.
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:11.260]   You could do it yourself.
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:17.380]   I've got one as a side table on my reading chair
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:18.700]   in the living room.
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:22.780]   It used to be serving files, and I was just
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:23.940]   holding up my beverage.
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:26.340]   It's serving you drinks.
[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:28.980]   It could still serve you drinks, and it could actually
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:32.540]   keep them warm if you plugged it in and kept running.
[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:34.060]   Stover pocket.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:35.620]   To this take, no one has figured out
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:40.180]   anything to do with the current Mac Pro trash can design.
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:42.060]   You really don't want to sit on it.
[01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:43.540]   Other than a trash can.
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:45.380]   It makes a wonderful door stop.
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:47.740]   Oh, you know what?
[01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:49.580]   Someone is going to be clever enough
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:52.140]   to put that into a potato can and just build a potato can
[01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:54.740]   and the right diameter you use that to slug.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:56.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:58.460]   They're shooting Mac Pro's at us.
[01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:02.100]   Let's take a break.
[01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:02.620]   Get ready.
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:06.940]   You're picking up next as we wrap up this very special Mac
[01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:08.500]   break weekly.
[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.780]   Adam Anks, if you don't subscribe to tidbits,

[01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:28.260]   Anything else you want to plug, Adam?
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:31.220]   That's the main thing I'm doing these days, apart from the

[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:38.180]   to Apple professionals, so consultants, resellers, whatnot,
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:40.540]   people who need to have a blog or an email newsletter, but
[01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:42.780]   don't have the time to write it themselves.
[01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:47.100]   You'll find it right at link right at the top at tidbits.com.

[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:49.500]   Yep, right there.
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:51.780]   Very nice.
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:57.340]   Mr. Annie Inako coming to us directly from some room in
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:00.300]   Brooklyn with a picture of New York behind him.
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:02.500]   With a beautiful scene.
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:05.660]   Again, again, if I weren't spending so much time trying to
[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:08.380]   get this computer to work with Skype and this network, I
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:10.940]   would have arranged it so that it would be a perfect
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:11.940]   best problem.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:14.940]   Just this close.
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:18.660]   You'll hear Annie every week on WGBH in Boston, Boston
[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:21.340]   Public Radio, and of course, here on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:24.260]   Don't forget his material podcast, where he covers
[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:30.140]   Android on the replay network replay.f
[01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:31.140]   amp.
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:35.220]   And Lori Gill, singing at a rock and roll venue near you.
[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:36.220]   That's funny.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:37.220]   I am.
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:39.140]   When's the next show?
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:42.180]   On Saturday night, I'll be playing at Benders in San
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:44.500]   Francisco if anybody wants to go see me.
[01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:45.740]   Scream my heart out.
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:48.540]   Oh, how exciting.
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:52.140]   She's currently gory kill on Twitter, but
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:53.140]   alcoholic.
[01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:56.780]   Yeah, everybody's trying to get they've got their Halloween
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:53:58.340]   or their scary name right now.
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.940]   And I just I couldn't resist.
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:01.500]   That's a good one.
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:02.780]   I thought so too.
[01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:04.620]   Did they call you that in high school?
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:07.500]   No, you know, I got called Snorri in high school.
[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:08.500]   Snorri.
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.900]   Yeah, or no, it wouldn't have been high school.
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:11.900]   They were over that high school.
[01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:14.420]   It was elementary school that I was getting called Snorri.
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:17.340]   I think gory kill is a great nickname.
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:18.500]   Yeah, it's pretty cute.
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.980]   I might have to change my stage name to gory kill.
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:21.980]   I like it.
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:23.540]   Your zombie name.
[01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:24.540]   Yeah.
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:27.340]   You need to, yeah, you need to definitely do a goth band
[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:28.660]   so you can use that name.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:29.660]   Yeah.
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:32.540]   That would be awesome.
[01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:38.340]   You find gory@imore.com where she's managing editor.
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:42.060]   And soon to be the boss when she deposes Renee Richie.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.060]   Yes, exactly.
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:44.900]   Now we'll eat his brains.
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:50.700]   Yeah, gory kill brains.
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:52.700]   We are brought to you today by WordPress.
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:54.460]   Actually, my blog has been brought to you by WordPress.
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:56.860]   I just got my badge and my WordPress app that I have been
[01:54:56.860 --> 01:55:00.420]   in 12 years at WordPress.com.
[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:02.100]   I've been using WordPress even longer.
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:03.140]   Yeah, isn't that nice?
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:04.740]   I love WordPress.
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:05.740]   I'm not alone.
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:08.020]   32% of all the websites you visit on the internet
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:10.140]   are running on WordPress.
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:11.140]   That'll tell you something.
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:16.940]   That's like a third, almost, of all the internet is powered by WordPress.
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:20.700]   It's because WordPress is the best content management system out there.
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:25.540]   If you don't have a place to call your own on the web, as an individual or even more
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:32.900]   importantly, as a business, you absolutely have to go and get your account at WordPress.com.
[01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:34.820]   At WordPress, there are no limits.
[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:41.020]   You can create the ultimate online hub that's yours, not Mr. Zuckerberg's, not Mr.
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:42.300]   Jax.
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:46.020]   It's yours with room to grow.
[01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:48.700]   And of course, all the content that's there is your content.
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:53.860]   You can upload images, video, audio and more, import and export content to and from your
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:54.860]   WordPress site.
[01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:58.340]   Your site, your home, your content, and you got to have that.
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:01.420]   You could still have the Facebook feed and the Twitter feed and all that stuff, but you
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:04.980]   got to have a place that you own that's yours and that's WordPress.com.
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:09.780]   Choose from hundreds of designs so you can match your vision, establish your brand.
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:12.100]   You don't have to have any design or engineering experience.
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:13.500]   Let WordPress do it all for you.
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:17.460]   They take care of the hosting, the security, the software updates.
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:24.260]   You focus on what you do best, create your content, put your album up there, put your
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:26.660]   art up there, your poetry.
[01:56:26.660 --> 01:56:30.700]   Talk about your business, get testimonials.
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:37.140]   Even have people with their social bookmarking link back to their Facebook and Twitter that
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:39.260]   help promote your site.
[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:43.020]   You get built-in search engine optimization, you get marketing tools.
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:45.020]   And I love the WordPress app.
[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:47.300]   When we were traveling, it was how I posted.
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:48.740]   It made it so easy to do.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:52.140]   You can also manage comments directly from there.
[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:57.220]   WordPress is the best anti-spam content engine ever called a Kismet.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:59.140]   I love it and I use it.
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:04.020]   You can also look at your statistics in the app so you can see how you're doing.
[01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:05.300]   And I love the notifications.
[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:10.060]   I get somebody just added your page, like your page, somebody just added a comment.
[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:13.500]   It makes you feel like you're not writing in a space that you're actually, people are
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.460]   reading what you do.
[01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:20.740]   And of course, if at any time you need help, they've got a great support team 24/7 to help
[01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:22.660]   you when you need it.
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:23.660]   Very affordable.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:26.220]   Plan started at just $4 a month.
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:28.180]   Find out how you can get involved.
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:32.180]   Go to WordPress.com/MacBreakRightNow.
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:34.180]   Create your website.
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:35.940]   Soon you'll get your 12-year badge.
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:37.900]   I love WordPress.
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:40.260]   My WordPress site is leoloport.com.
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:42.500]   If you want to take a look at it, that's where I put my pictures.
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.340]   I don't use social media anymore.
[01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:45.740]   WordPress is my medium.
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.940]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:57.620]   Like 15% off, by the way, if you go there on your brand new website, WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:57:57.620 --> 01:57:58.620]   All right, Adam, thanks.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:57:59.620]   Here's your chance.
[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:01.820]   A pick of the week.
[01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:02.900]   Pick of the week.
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:10.540]   So I think Andy mentioned a while back in June sometime that the Libby app from Overdrive,
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:13.460]   which you can use to borrow books from your local public library.
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:14.460]   And I use Libby.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:15.460]   Libby's absolutely great.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:16.940]   Use it within your public library.
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:22.540]   There's actually another app that the Finger Lakes Library system here in Ithaca uses called
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:23.540]   Hoopla.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:26.660]   If you go to Hoopla Digital.com.
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:32.220]   And it's roughly the same principle in terms of, you know, a big catalog of books and movies
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:34.380]   and music and things that you can borrow.
[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:38.060]   And it's a little bit different, at least here, in the sense that you can borrow a limited
[01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:43.900]   number of things per month, but you, it's not quite the scene.
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:47.580]   You don't just want to get as anything you want.
[01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:51.220]   But the thing that really sets it apart, and I think Andy might appreciate this, is they
[01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:55.580]   actually have a really large selection of comics.
[01:58:55.580 --> 01:59:00.660]   And so, you know, comics are one of those things which drive me nuts because I read really
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:01.980]   quickly.
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:07.180]   And so I just, you know, I can't kind of get around to buying a comic because I will
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:09.260]   read it in 10 minutes.
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:15.980]   And so, I literally like the collections, and they have collections and collections.
[01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:23.100]   So I'm sort of working my way through, you know, like, I don't know, 40 collections
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:27.580]   of Invincible, and really enjoying it.
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:31.020]   And again, not something that I would probably have done unless I could have tried it from
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:34.620]   the library, and Hoopla makes that possible.
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:39.020]   So definitely worth checking out to see if your public library supports it.
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:43.540]   But if it does, download a copy and see what you can get.
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:45.220]   Very nice.
[01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.260]   What's the URL?
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:49.340]   Hoopladigital.com.
[01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:51.300]   Hoopladigital.com.
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:53.260]   I just like saying it.
[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:54.260]   Hoopla.
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:55.260]   Hoopla.
[01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:57.260]   You got to get to get to go.
[01:59:57.260 --> 01:59:58.260]   Hoopla, you know.
[01:59:58.260 --> 01:59:59.260]   Hoopla.
[01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:03.340]   Andy and I go pick of the week, sir.
[02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:07.780]   I have to abstain courteously because I was so busy trying to solve a problem with my
[02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:10.620]   MacBook yesterday that I did not choose an item.
[02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:13.860]   What happened to your MacBook?
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:17.580]   Oh, the SSD decided to go home with Jesus.
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:22.420]   So it can't be found by the operating system.
[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:27.980]   So basically, I have to, the only solution was to prepare an external boot disk.
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:29.860]   Obviously, I'm going to replace it.
[02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:34.820]   And once it's out of this device, I can actually try to troubleshoot it and see what happened
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:36.020]   to it and probably get it back.
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:40.380]   It's an SSD, which means that it's always in a course of degrading.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:43.140]   Sometimes you just get a bad fall of the dice.
[02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:51.100]   And it turns out that it is a boot sector or it's a part of the device that makes it
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:54.300]   impossible to actually be recognized by the rest of the...
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:58.860]   It was terrible because I went to bed with a functioning MacBook on my desk.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:02.900]   And then the morning I woke it up and then it just decided that...
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:05.900]   We shall get the Rathery.
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:10.700]   Sounds like a new SSD is your pick of the week.
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:11.900]   But it's replaceable, right?
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:13.660]   Because I know some of these devices.
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:17.180]   Yeah, so maybe my pick of the week is I fix it, as usual.
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:22.460]   Whatever is what I said happens to your Mac, you can at least go to iFixit.com and find
[02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:25.780]   out that, okay, this is not a difficult thing to fix.
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:28.780]   I know look, the component is not that expensive either.
[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:34.580]   And of course, because I have a recent backup of everything, at worst I've lost.
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:39.100]   There may be a couple of files that I've touched in the past three days that haven't
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:40.220]   been backed up.
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:41.220]   So no big deal.
[02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:47.340]   Just more annoying that on a day when I really wanted to be sleeping in advance of being
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:53.020]   able to go to New York and spend an entire day being abundant, that I was trying to get
[02:01:53.020 --> 02:01:56.060]   a Mac that looked...
[02:01:56.060 --> 02:02:03.940]   It's a turn a Mac shape object into a functional Macintosh.
[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:06.460]   Well, I wish you the best.
[02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:07.940]   Mac just walked that.
[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:10.340]   You probably just surely as the sparks fly upward.
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:11.340]   Yes.
[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:14.260]   I mean, you spilled Coke into your last one.
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:18.180]   You just bought that like two years ago?
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:21.980]   Three years ago, it was like a late 2015 model.
[02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:25.300]   Believe me, the first thing I thought was, oh no.
[02:02:25.300 --> 02:02:29.540]   If this Mac is busted, I'm going to have to decide whether or not to buy a brand.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:30.540]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:31.540]   That's so ridiculous.
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.740]   He doesn't like that butterfly.
[02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:39.860]   Well, see, the problem is now that I've talked, I've said so much crap about it at this point
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:45.100]   that even if I decided that was the best choice, there was no way I could possibly live it
[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:46.100]   down.
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:47.100]   So...
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:48.100]   You know what?
[02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:49.100]   I see your excuses.
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:52.300]   The 2018s are slightly improved.
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:54.060]   And I'm completely with you.
[02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:56.700]   I don't like the butterfly, but it's just good enough that I can use it.
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:02:57.700]   I've been using the 2018s.
[02:02:57.700 --> 02:02:59.860]   Yeah, I have that opinion too.
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:03.580]   It's just good enough that I could maybe get by with it.
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:04.580]   It's not ideal.
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:10.900]   But for $1,500, I don't want a keyboard that is just a poke in the eye with a blunter stick
[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:13.100]   than last year's phone.
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:14.100]   I do believe you can.
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:18.140]   I know you can because I've done it, replaced the SSDs in the 2015s.
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:19.900]   They're actually fairly easy to do.
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:22.300]   In fact, if you need any help, let me know.
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:27.660]   But it's just a question of a screwdriver, about 18 little tiny screws on the back and
[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:28.660]   you're in.
[02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:30.260]   Not a hard thing to do.
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:34.940]   Your thing for us will pop some corn, but my boy is the most victorious.
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:37.020]   Lori Gail, your pick-a-week.
[02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:43.780]   So we were talking about using iPad, the new iPad Pro as a second screen.
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:48.660]   So it made me think of the Luna display, which turns your iPad into a second screen for
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:51.780]   your iPad or for your MacBook.
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:56.700]   Yeah, because as far as I can tell, Duet hasn't worked in a while.
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:03:58.500]   Luna does so, huh?
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:03.300]   I was using Duet just not that long ago.
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:08.140]   After the 12, iOS 12 update, and it was working, so I don't know.
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.260]   Okay, I'll have to try again.
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:12.220]   So Luna, tell us about that.
[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:14.900]   But yeah, Luna is this little thing.
[02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:17.060]   It's a tiny little dongle.
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:18.900]   Oh, it's hardware.
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:25.780]   It's only slightly larger than the USB-C port itself.
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:30.940]   You plug it into your Mac or MacBook Pro or MacBook Air now.
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:38.180]   And it creates a wireless connection with your iPad and it has a really very minimal
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:47.860]   lag, which there are apps out there that allow you to wirelessly connect from your Mac to
[02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:48.860]   your iPad.
[02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:54.380]   But this one is much, much better because it's a physical piece of hardware.
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:05:00.260]   They use what they call liquid technology, which I'm not exactly sure the details of
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:03.100]   it and why it helps, but it does improve a lot.
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:06.300]   And through testing myself, it has a little bit of lag.
[02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:09.100]   It's not as perfect as they want you to believe it to be.
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:11.220]   But it's a very, very small amount of lag.
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:19.140]   So you can definitely work on your iPad as if it were a screen to your MacBook very, very
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:20.220]   easily.
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:22.660]   So that just made me think of that.
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:29.780]   For people who aren't getting the new iPad Pro, who aren't ready to jump on board with
[02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:35.100]   that kind of massive technology, for $80, you can get a little dongle that will turn your
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:39.540]   MacBook-- will turn your iPad into a second screen for your MacBook.
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:41.620]   Oh, isn't this sweet?
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:42.620]   Yeah.
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:43.620]   I like it.
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:44.620]   Yeah, because duet is wired.
[02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:45.620]   Yes.
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:46.620]   Yes.
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:50.940]   Which, duet actually has a better-- the performance is better, but it is wired.
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:56.740]   So you lose that kind of playability and portability when you have to plug them into each other.
[02:05:56.740 --> 02:05:58.140]   Laurie, Gil, we love you.
[02:05:58.140 --> 02:05:59.140]   Thank you for being here, man.
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:00.580]   You get it or I, more.
[02:06:00.580 --> 02:06:01.580]   Come back any day.
[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:02.740]   I always say that.
[02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:03.740]   Thank you for--
[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:07.740]   Well, I swear, Renee's brain, it's going to be eaten very soon.
[02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:08.740]   I'm hungry.
[02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:12.260]   What's your costume tomorrow?
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:14.340]   You know, I wore my costume over the weekend.
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:16.020]   I think I talked about it last week.
[02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:18.020]   I was a member of Metalocalips.
[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:19.140]   Oh, how did it go?
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:21.420]   We dress up for the big party over the weekend.
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:22.420]   I went well.
[02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:24.460]   We did get people recognized what we were.
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:27.220]   So we had to be in the group.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:28.220]   Yes.
[02:06:28.220 --> 02:06:36.420]   Yeah, because it's Metalop-- Metalop-- Metalop-- anyway, they're not-- you have to be of a
[02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:41.420]   certain age to remember Metalocalips.
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:46.420]   Yeah, you have to know metal or you have to have--
[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:48.420]   And you have to watch Adult Swim.
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:49.420]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:51.220]   Oh, there's a lot of cuss words in this.
[02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:52.220]   I don't know if you want to--
[02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:54.220]   Oh, well, I'm not playing the audio.
[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:55.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:56.220]   Just the pictures.
[02:06:56.220 --> 02:07:01.220]   So the one with the long brown hair was the character that I played.
[02:07:01.220 --> 02:07:02.220]   Did you have that kind of--
[02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:03.220]   took the word to?
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:04.220]   Fumanche, you must have.
[02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:05.220]   Oh, man.
[02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:08.420]   Did I cut some hair off of the wig and glued it directly to my face?
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:12.020]   See, I might have to go back to social media just to see that.
[02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:13.020]   Yeah.
[02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:14.020]   Thank you, Laurie.
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:15.020]   Andy and us--
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:16.020]   I'm not coming.
[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:17.020]   What's your costume?
[02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:19.620]   I've just finished my costume on Sunday.
[02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:24.900]   Tomorrow, when trick-or-treaters come, I'm going to be man at second-story window with
[02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:26.820]   big bucket of ice water.
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:27.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:30.220]   That sounds so fun.
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:31.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:31.220 --> 02:07:34.220]   Very-- that's a very metal costume.
[02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:35.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:37.660]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:40.180]   You can hear him at WGBH in Boston.
[02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:42.820]   Thank you for going through all the trials you went through to get on.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:43.820]   We really appreciate it.
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:44.820]   We were very glad to be here.
[02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:47.020]   Ah, well worth it to talk to such an August panel.
[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:48.020]   Yes.
[02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:49.020]   Or even an October panel.
[02:07:49.020 --> 02:07:52.820]   You ought to see us in October, that's what it was meant.
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:56.620]   And thank you to Stud Muffin, Mr. Adam Anks.
[02:07:56.620 --> 02:07:57.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:57.620 --> 02:07:59.420]   God, he's looking buff.
[02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:03.700]   Tidbits.com, he runs 100 miles a day, and it's showing.
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:06.460]   @AdamAnks to follow him on the Twitter.
[02:08:06.460 --> 02:08:07.460]   Thank you, Adam.
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:08.460]   Always a pleasure.
[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:09.460]   Glad to be here.
[02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:10.460]   All right.
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:12.140]   Have a great day, everybody.
[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:13.500]   We thank you for joining us.
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:18.300]   Don't forget we did a-- this morning, our version of the live stream, which YouTube
[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:20.820]   immediately cut off for copyright violation.
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:21.820]   Ah!
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:22.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:26.780]   We're working on getting that button back, but you can still go to Twitter.tv/specials
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:31.940]   if you want to see the Apple event with Meghan Moroni and My Commentary.
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:33.940]   You can get any of our shows at Twitter.tv.
[02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:35.420]   This show is at Twitter.tv/MBW.
[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:40.580]   And you can watch anything we do live if you know the calendar, which is at Twitter.tv/calendar.
[02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:46.940]   In the case of this show, it's Tuesdays, round 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:53.900]   It starting next week because we're going into a standard time here in the United States.
[02:08:53.900 --> 02:09:00.940]   So starting next week, it will be at 1900 UTC if my math is correct.
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:03.700]   I know UTC doesn't move, we move.
[02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:05.460]   1900 UTC.
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:10.620]   Please stop by Twitter.tv/live as the live feed, audio and video.
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:14.060]   If you do that, join us in the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:17.820]   And of course, the best way to get all of our shows, I can't say it enough.
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:18.820]   I want you to do it.
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:20.900]   Please, it helps us if you subscribe.

[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:33.260]   With that, I must say, I'm sad to say it's time to get back to work because break time
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:34.260]   is over.
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:35.260]   We'll see you next time.
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:35.260]   Bye-bye.
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:45.780]   [MUSIC]
