[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.520]   triumphant return of our travel and man Renee Ritchie from imore.com. Hello Renee.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.720]   Hi Leo. I missed you all terribly. I did not want to be away. It ended badly for me.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.840]   We literally haven't seen you since WWDC since before WWDC. I travel Leo and then I
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.760]   lost my wallet. I accidentally deleted my phone while trying to play AR Slingshot with iJustine
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.640]   and then I got to horribly sick. So like I said, it worked out well. Wow. I got to
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.680]   find out about that AR Slingshot thing in a second. But first let me say hi to Andy
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:12.840]   and not go from nocco.com and the WGBH radio station and Canada apparently. Well, I'm
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.520]   a supporter of our I want to show solidarity with our we're still friends. We're still
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.680]   loving you. Forget that other guy. He's he'll love Canada. Yeah. Yeah. And Mr. Alex
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.080]   Lindsey in the house. Great to have you two. Alex from Pixelcore. The best Canadian quote
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.240]   I heard the other week was you know someday Canada's going to take over the world and
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.560]   then you'll all be sorry. Oh, I'll be happy unless they're unless they're so nice because
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.520]   they've been holding back and they're going to release their house. We don't have hounds
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.480]   at all. No, I like being mean to Canada's like sucker punching Mr. Rogers. It just doesn't
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.280]   end well for anybody. Well, there is good news that apparently China has told of president
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.680]   Trump has told Tim Cook that they will not tariff iPhones coming from China. That was
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.840]   a complicated sense. Yeah, it parts that sense for me. It's interesting. There's a great
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:18.480]   article in the New York Times on Sunday about yeah, Apple's two pronged diplomatic outreach
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.760]   to of course, China and to the president trying to make sure that they can continue to make
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.720]   iPhones in China and get them into the United States without a tariff. That'd be the deal.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.880]   Well, they're not TVs and phones are not tariffed at this point. And it wouldn't by the way
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.000]   just be Apple that would be inconvenienced by a phone tariff. Me me be everybody really.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.160]   Samsung phones are made in Korea for the most part, but and there are phones made in Taiwan.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   HTC makes its phones in Taiwan, but a lot of phones made in China. All right. Tell us
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.520]   about slingshotting. We saw we watched the video of you in Justine playing table slingshot.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.400]   It looked like it was kind of fun. So I had I had the slingshot session right before I
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.840]   was supposed to go talk to Apple about iOS 12. So I had to I wanted to update my phones like
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.200]   I see if I had any questions and the over the year update wasn't working. So I very cleverly
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.880]   downloaded it to iTunes and then I went over and I started doing it and then like come over,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.080]   come over and Justine is already and I race over and I press the button right before I
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.800]   leave and I press restore instead of restore from backup. Oh, no. So all I see is a keys
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.960]   being thrown away and the phone being wiped. And then the worst part is that I got to talk
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.400]   Jim Dalrymple was my briefing buddy for the day and he was merciless. He was so mean that
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.000]   I'm starting to think he didn't leave Canada. He was actually even after Apple featured him
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.360]   in the opening movie prominently in the middle as a developer walking down the with the hordes
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.080]   of other developers. Yeah, he had to beard, but Hockenberry had the hair and I think maybe
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.840]   he was upset he had to share the no, he was fantastic. He just would not let me. Oh, big
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.320]   time Apple expert deletes the phone. How's the phone doing? Renny? Oh, he was mean to
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.080]   you, not Apple. Yes. No, me. Yeah. Okay, that makes more sense.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.480]   Jim's only mean to Apple when they touch his mute when they come anywhere near his music.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.120]   Oh, near my nose. Hey, how was the new? Did they do a podcast studio this year? Yeah,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.240]   it was really nice. They had like 3D printed walls with Apple podcast logos on them. And
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.600]   I got to use them twice. I talked to the team who made agenda and then I talked to the team
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.320]   who made the app that scans the blood tissue to see how much is on the towels and then
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.920]   keeps a running record of how much blood you're saving or losing during an operation using
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.560]   machine learning, which was wild to me. I think it's called Trident Sponges. And it was
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.280]   just like the four person set up and they recorded all for you and give you a garage
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.320]   band project at the end, which is really nice. Oh, hey, that's cool. They recorded on GarageBand.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah. Yeah, I think it's a GarageBand project. GarageBand or a lot? Would they use logic?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.760]   I think it might be logic. I just pulled a wave file because I didn't want to use the
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.560]   project that they made. So I just pulled the wave file. That's pretty sweet. Yeah. And
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.040]   they had a continual rotation. How is that Slingshot game? Is it fun? It's fun. So I
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.360]   got to try the Lego one first. The Lego one is a lot of fun. Like I would actually play
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.800]   the Lego game. Like you open up the Lego thing, you drop the Joker in, you watch him set fire
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.560]   to it. You pull the fire out of the fire truck around, you spray him down, you bring Batman
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.120]   over, he kind of looks around and starts hitting him. It's just, it's a lot of fun. The Slingshot
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.080]   game is actually the sample code that they made to show you this multi person AR. And
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.960]   I don't know what the limit is because they kept throwing people in there. You can have
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.160]   two or more players and then you get multiple people watching it and they had one of the
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.240]   people watching it on the television so everybody could watch it. And it looks like a table
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.840]   and people were joking, "Ah, this table holds all the hardware that Apple announced today."
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.040]   But it actually held this entire AR structure and just being killed me the first game because
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.600]   you're Slingshot and trying to knock down the other person's slingshots and you're walking
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.000]   around, you have to pull them up. But once you get into multi person and it's persistent,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.320]   it's really cool. And it looks like Alex used to always talk about how you have to have
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.840]   it anchored or you don't believe the experience. And it was just rock solid even when they
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.520]   had four, five, six people doing the demo together.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.600]   And one of the things I did, one of the things interesting about why it's rock solid is that
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.280]   just a little trick here that I think is going on with the AR is that I think so.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:26.760]   You have the wood table looks gorgeous, but it provides an awful lot of detail for the
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.960]   camera to grab onto it. Because what it does is it's using that--
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.920]   It lifts the knots in on purpose.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:37.000]   Oh, yeah. All that data is what makes it-- it's able to grab onto all those things because
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.120]   basically you have the accelerometer kind of telling you where you're at. But that's
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.720]   plus or minus x number of degrees. And the final lockdown is grabbing onto elements,
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.000]   basically doing a 2D track into that space and then looking at the parallax to calculate
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.160]   the 3D location of the--
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.320]   So a glossy black table would not have been ideal in this situation.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   It would have been horrible.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.680]   The only thing worse than a glossy black table would have been a glossy white table, but
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.840]   you know, because it would have blown out. And so smooth surfaces are not something that
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.840]   works well with--
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   But Naughty Pine.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:17.160]   You know what? If I were a hedge fund manager, I would go out and invest in naughty pine
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160]   pictures.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.160]   And we have a title.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.640]   The other cool thing is they have these machine learning algorithms that try to fool you into
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.200]   thinking there's actual environmental maps on reflective surfaces. And when you're playing
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   a game where you're just moving by, you don't notice that they're not--
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   You can't get attention to it, yeah.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.080]   But it looks like there's actually a universal camera reflecting everything for you.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   Wow, that's very cool.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.680]   Yeah, the AR stuff was legit. It was really well done.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.960]   They had all AR gaming section where you first walk in. There was like four tables. And I
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.840]   have to say, the Apple retail staff, all the Apple events are staffed by Apple retail.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.600]   In this case, they were wearing orange shirts. And they were there all day, every day, motivating,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.960]   welcoming, doing all the gameplay, doing all the-- handing out all the pins and everything.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.960]   And they were-- they were flawless from beginning.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.320]   Wasn't your sense that that room was for journalists or for developers? It sounds like
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.840]   it was more for journalists.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.960]   For the first day, they had a couple-- because they have YouTubers in on the first day, and
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.880]   they gave them a few minutes to go in and film their stuff. But then after that, they
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.080]   were just long lines of developers the entire show.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.080]   Interesting.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.480]   And they kept adding levels and adding sophistication. And at the very end, they had a tournament
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.680]   where the prize was all the pins that they handed out. And there was just teams of people
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.360]   like cheering, and you could hear it through the entire complex by the last day.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.920]   There's a long-standing debate, probably more on the outside than on the inside, but I wouldn't
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:32.320]   be surprised if Apple debates as well about what WWDC should be. And it turns out that
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.520]   if it's cool for journalists, it's cool for developers' tools. And coolness is important.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.080]   Developers want to be writing software on a platform that's got some--
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.640]   Well, I think that you also--
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:49.760]   You need to-- I think that with a genius of building that game is that it inspires developers
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.520]   to play with the AR game. And they gave them all the data. I mean, all the Xcode is all
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.040]   there that provided. So if you want to figure out how that was done, how that was calculated,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.600]   it's the-- I think that Apple and other companies supporting developers should do a lot more
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.280]   of that. You know, of building something that's actually usable, that's actually cool, and
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.600]   then something that-- here's-- you can tear it apart and look at it and figure out how
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   it was actually built. I think that it was a genius thing to do.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:25.160]   Does Apple have crack developers who are there entirely for producing demos?
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.160]   I have no idea.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.720]   That would be an interesting--
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:33.160]   They have a dev pub team. So part of-- there's-- the organization is all under Craig Federighi,
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.560]   and then I think Cheryl runs that section. And it's called developer publications, and
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.840]   they do everything from Swift Playgrounds to sample code to the online documentation.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.960]   Okay. So sample codes are most of documentation function.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.920]   Yeah, and they're all stars that cycle through that group routinely.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.640]   Yeah. Because if you're busy writing this stuff, you know, if your Andy Hertzfeld, you
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.720]   don't really want to spend time writing demos, you probably don't even have time to write
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.120]   demos. Of course, you understand better than anybody what the product can do, so it would
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.240]   be smart for them to have a team. Maybe it is the technical documentation team that
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:11.480]   is interfacing with the people writing the actual code, and then writing demo code to
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.000]   inspire developers and to show developers, show the way and inspire.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.640]   And I don't know about Apple, but most technology companies do have kind of teams that are just
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   playing. Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   You know, like--
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.720]   Well, it's part of QA, too, right? Right. Right.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.560]   But they've got to bang on it to-- Dogfood either.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.280]   It's super smart that they put the AR game tables right at the main download area. So
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.800]   while you're waiting to download, there's no reason not to get up there and try out
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   all that stuff.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.640]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, we all, you know, saw the keynote. And then there are, if I guess if
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.720]   you want, and I guess Renee, you've been watching these, you can also watch videos from every
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.840]   one of the presentations afterwards.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.440]   Yeah, the sessions are really good. I love the labs because they're really interesting.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.920]   Everyone asks different questions, but they have these meetups that are amazing. Like,
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.640]   they have health meetups and app meetups. And every year, I make it a point to go to
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.760]   the accessibility meetup because to me, that's where you see the really cool technologies.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.520]   And there were two that were really stood out this year. One was this young guy. I can't
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.200]   tell how young he was. He just looked super young from Italy. And he made it so that you
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:15.560]   just put your iPhone 10 on a little tripod behind your Mac. And the true-depth camera
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.400]   maps your-- you're turning your head or going up and down to move the cursor on your Mac.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.560]   You move your mouse side to side to click or double click. And you can navigate the entire
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.040]   Mac interface just using your iPhone 10, which means you don't have to buy usually a really
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.800]   expensive switch control system. And there was just a huge line of people looking at that.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.520]   And another guy, he wanted to get away from society. So he went to like a remote island
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.760]   off the coast of the Maritimes. And then he got bored and he made an app that would just
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.640]   read your reading list to your kids. And overnight, right after they announced Siri shortcuts,
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.840]   at night he integrated it in. So he could just say Siri read a story. And it would just start
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:56.080]   reading from his Safari bookmark pages to his kids to him and he integrated chair. And
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.000]   it became huge for the blind community because they've been waiting for something that would
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.200]   just queue up and start reading anything they wanted to it.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.440]   So you don't even have to-- it looks like sign in to look at these. You don't have to be
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440]   a developer.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.680]   No, they've changed all-- yeah, they've gotten much more open with all of this stuff.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   So you can go to the website.com/videos.com/videos. And you can go to the website. And you can go

[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.680]   And you can go to the website.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.680]   And you just took a picture of me.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.680]   And you're saying, here's a picture.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.680]   Let me show people.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.680]   Because that's crazy.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   Way more 3D.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.680]   And there's segmentation.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.680]   It's way bigger.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   It's a Leo being sucked into the vortex.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   If you move that little discretes.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   That's a slider here.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   That's a slider that wasn't focused.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   But grab that little percentage.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   There you go.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   So you took this.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   This is basically the picture you took.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.680]   But it has additional definition.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.680]   This is how the portrait mode is calculated.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.680]   Leo's being decid--
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   I'm just going to say, I'm just going to say, I've been
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   fired at 12.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.680]   It was much flatter than that.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   That is good just by itself.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   Wow, that's wild.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.680]   That is really interesting.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   So you're saying this is better than 11.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   And it's important because Google's amazing.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   It's segmentation masking.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   They can take an essentially 2D image and make it look like depth effect just fine.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   But there's a lot of things that a lot of developers want to do.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   Like that face tracking app.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   That's just not possible unless you have accurate face measuring and depth data.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.680]   And once you have that, you're entering the AR world already.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   I might just stop the show.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   Let's just watch some videos.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.680]   Here's introducing dark-- no.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   That's great tempting.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.680]   As you say, Renee, they did a great job shooting these.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.680]   So they're fun.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.680]   They're actually like watching a movie.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.680]   You could watch them on the big screen.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.680]   I'm picking up a ton of skill just watching.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.680]   They're not just like a camera locked down in the back.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.680]   And only a couple years ago, I think it was four or five years ago,
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.680]   they were only showing screens.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.680]   Right.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   Yes.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   Crazy.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.680]   And then I've seen Microsoft do the opposite.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.680]   At Microsoft Defense, they had the guy Brian with the hat demoing stuff.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.680]   And all they showed was him going like this the whole time.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   They never showed the screen.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.680]   Right.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.680]   So it's hard to get a little bit of both.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   One more really good session is Ari Weinstein's Siri shortcut session where you can see what
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   the future of workflow holds.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.680]   Ah, I'm very interested in that.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   Because the workflow app is going to become the shortcuts app either late in the beta
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.680]   or when the release comes out.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.960]   Oh, we suspected that this was workflow that they were using.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.120]   So they are.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   And that's interesting.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:51.040]   If you have, as I do, the workflow app, I'm sure all of us do on our iPads, it will
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.280]   just turn into shortcuts at some point.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.440]   And you can actually cheat it now.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.680]   So if you go into workflow and then you go into settings, Siri, it will show you your
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.680]   workflows and you can assign a voice command to them already.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.680]   Mmm.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.040]   And it's worth pointing out that a lot of people are looking at it and saying this is really
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.840]   overly complicated and it's automation and no one's going to use it.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.160]   It's really best to think about it as two completely separate systems.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.680]   There is automation for shortcuts and all the stuff nerds want.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.840]   But it is going to throw very convenient.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   It's like Merlin's old rule.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.960]   If you do it five times, it should be automatic.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.520]   If you turn on the lock screen, it's going to show you something that you might want to
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.520]   do.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.640]   You open an app, it's going to show you something.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.560]   And just hitting that button saves you having to go through, find the app you want, find
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.880]   the setting you want, the tab you want, the feature you want, tap the button, do all those
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   things.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   It's just one button and it's done.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.040]   And I think for a lot of people, it'll save them an incredible amount of time, but also
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.240]   save them having to go through so much interface every day.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.800]   So I just typed workflow in the search.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.680]   And there's quite a few videos that include information about workflow.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   Which one?
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.680]   You want Siri shortcuts.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680]   Ah, Siri shortcuts.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.800]   Yeah, that's going to be the new name.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.800]   Okay.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   So don't look for workflow.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.480]   Of course, they wouldn't call it that.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.480]   They'd call it.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.680]   Although it is called workflow kit, I think under the course.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.840]   Is it funny?
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.840]   Siri shortcuts on Siri.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.640]   Watch face building for voice with Siri.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.360]   Is he introduction to Siri shortcuts?
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.360]   Yeah, that's session 211.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.440]   Oh man, I'm excited.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.840]   This is, you know what?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.840]   This is how it should be.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.000]   Microsoft's done this.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.880]   And this is what they're famous for is that they put all of the videos online and people
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.960]   who can't make it to build, get to see everything.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.600]   I'm glad Apple's now.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.520]   They used to be like it's all NDA.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.800]   Nobody can know anything.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.560]   And I imagine there's a challenge between telling developers and publicizing new stuff
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.680]   and keeping it.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.160]   I think a lot of people, I think a lot of folks that do conferences worry that people
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160]   won't show up if the videos are available.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.800]   Well, an Apple's case.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.080]   Apple does not have that problem.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.920]   Or Microsoft's case or Google's case.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.680]   They just want to get the word out to the largest number of people.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.800]   The issue for Apple, I mean Google and Microsoft have never held back.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.480]   But the issue for Apple was they always want to keep stuff secret as well.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.480]   So didn't they used to NDA?
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.320]   They used to NDA everybody who went to anything to NDA.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.320]   And there was no press and there was no...
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.320]   Yeah, they kicked out after the keynote.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.320]   Wasn't a couple more than a couple.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.320]   They still have some concerns.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.960]   Like they're worried that if they show like we see a button in one of these things and
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.640]   that button changes during the beta, you'll be all upset because they took your button
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640]   away.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   No, please.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   But I think they're just getting used to the fact that things will change and they'll
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.640]   get some heat for it.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.640]   That's fine.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640]   Now, why not get everybody happy?
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.640]   Why not get everybody happy?
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   Why not get everybody happy?
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   Why not get everybody happy?
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.640]   Why not get everybody happy?
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.640]   Why not get everybody happy?
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   Why not get everybody happy?
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.640]   Why not get everybody happy?
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.520]   I think it's an early access program and a lot of developers.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.520]   Right.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   Right.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.240]   The other thing that was really cool is that there's two series shortcuts has both a new
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:50.760]   Siri API for intents, but it also works off the old NS activity API, which is what
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.560]   they used for continuity like handoff and also remember this for Siri.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.480]   So if apps are already using that, you'll see them already in the, if you go to settings
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.880]   Siri shortcuts, you'll see them already all available to you.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.560]   So there's a bunch of stuff in there.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.360]   And it's nice because that functionality is so convenient.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.600]   It's what remembers what you're doing in an app.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.920]   And you basically get it for free now, just with Siri access.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:19.000]   Fred Areco of it, he writing in Mac stories said the best possible outcome last year,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.680]   he wrote an article on workflow.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.960]   The more optimistic outcome envisioned and updated workflow app is a native iOS automation
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   layer.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.280]   This is last year deeply integrated with the system and it's built in frameworks.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.680]   He got exactly what he saw as the best case scenario.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   Right.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   I mean, this is.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.400]   I think you're right.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.040]   There is that issue of, well, who's going to make shortcuts?
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.960]   But the Siri suggestions kind of do it for you.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   Am I right?
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   No, they're push interface.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.160]   Like for the years, we've had to do this pull interface thing where you, again, you
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.240]   go and find the app, you go into the app, you find the tab, you go into the tab, you
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.760]   find the list, you go into the list, you find what you want to do, you tap the button.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.280]   And that's, that's really non accessible to a huge percentage of the population.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.040]   And then we got notifications, which were better, but you tap them and you go to the
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.480]   app and you have to find your way out.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.440]   Then we got actionable notifications, which are even better because you could like reply
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.000]   in line, but it didn't do very many things.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.200]   And it wasn't really personalized.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.760]   It was all dependent on a trigger that was someone else sending you something or an alarm
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.960]   going off or a sports score happening.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.360]   And now it's going to do it.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.320]   Like I've been using it for two weeks and I, for example, I got a push notification saying,
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.400]   your movie pass is on.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   It looks like you're going into the theater.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.400]   Do you want to turn on?
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   Do not disturb?
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   I'm like, yes, yes, I do.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.240]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.040]   And my mom texted me for brunch and it said, looks like you're going to have brunch with
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   your mom.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   Do you want to do that?
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   Oh my God.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.400]   Remember, when Google did this with Google now cards, everybody said creepy line, creepy
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.520]   line, you think that this isn't going to be the same problem for Apple?
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.840]   Well, I mean, it's on device only.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.400]   If it does any communication with the server, it's end to end encrypted.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.760]   You're assigned an anonymous token.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.520]   So Apple has no idea who you are or what you're doing.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.440]   When you restart your phone, that token is reset.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.520]   So there's multiple layers of anonymity there.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.160]   They do keep some people are worried that Apple is too anonymous that they lose out
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.560]   on a ton of machine learning opportunities and improvement vectors by not taking any
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.640]   data, but they do preserve like anonymized utterances.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.480]   They can go back for quality assurance or to improve series understanding of language.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.320]   All of that stuff they hold on to for a couple of months to make sure they improve the system,
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.760]   but there's nothing to tie you to it.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.080]   So I think one is that as an extension of notifications, people are used to seeing things
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.080]   in their lock screen.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.080]   They won't find it abnormal.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.880]   They'll find it convenient.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.720]   And also Apple has no business attached to keeping that information.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.360]   So it doesn't feel like they're using you to get the data.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.360]   OK.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.840]   You know, one could make the argument that they've kicked the can down the road by just making
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.400]   all the intrusions come from the apps.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.280]   You know, in other words, the apps know what you're up to, but I guess they would anyway.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   Yes.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.600]   And there's an interesting thing happening.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.720]   You'd describe that movie pass thing.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.920]   So there's data being combined from the movie pass app, but also from your GPS in your
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.040]   phone, from your phone itself.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.600]   Well, the movie pass is triggered.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.840]   So the movie pass will be triggered on your lock screen and it will say you're at the
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.840]   movie.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.520]   And what it's doing now is knowing that you're at the movie, it's offering you do not disturb.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.440]   But so what the OS is getting information from the app, but it's also getting information
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.440]   from the app.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   It has it.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.560]   You're saying it's just not, it's not going to leave your phone.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.880]   So it always gave you a little bit like it always gave you the pass on your lock screen so
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.000]   you can scan your tickets immediately because that's convenient.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Now it's starting to understand that there may be other things related to that that would
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.520]   be convenient to you as well.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   OK.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.080]   And that's an important device.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.840]   That's an intent that movie pass or whoever the app developer has to enable.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.880]   If they have NS activity, I'm forgetting the long name of the NS user activity, then that
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.280]   a lot of it will be done already.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.080]   But the intense thing is if you want to create something like Spotify, for example, can create
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   an intent saying your favorite or your most frequent pod.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.640]   This is your most frequent playlist.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.440]   And then you can assign a shortcut to it and you could say play Spotify and it will play
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.240]   your most popular playlist.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.400]   Or you can say play my Spotify playlist or play my Spotify workout list and it can go
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.960]   through and choose different playlists to play for you.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.320]   So it's basically defining what you can do with an app.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.960]   And in those updates, they're not going back and talking to Spotify or talking.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   I mean, telling it it's being activated or the movie pass.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.400]   Yeah, I mean, it's different.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.600]   So it's got advantage and this advantage.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.600]   The huge disadvantage is that most services like Alexa and Google now work on the web
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.400]   level and the server level and the interface directly with the API where Apple is doing
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.200]   it on device, which means that Spotify eventually will have to tell Apple everything that it
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.280]   can do, which is a much more laborious process.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.240]   Apple prefers it because they want to do on device.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.200]   They don't want to put all your stuff in the cloud, but we'll see how far every developer
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.400]   is willing to go with that.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.800]   I have to admit, I just realized that you can build your own skills on.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.160]   I mean, I knew that you could do it, but I didn't actually do it on Alexa until this
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.160]   weekend.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.880]   So you could set up all your own questions with all your own absurd answers.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.880]   It's ours.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   And it's pretty smart.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.560]   Like if you lumber you are to do that or...
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.880]   No, there's an Alexa interface.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.880]   There's an Alexa interface.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   They just recently did that.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.280]   You know, I got some email and I was just like, oh, I'm trying to get out.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.280]   They had routines, yeah.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.480]   And you can just start putting in stuff that you want to...
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   Yeah, that would have been less than this.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   Yeah, it's a...
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.040]   So you didn't miss that much.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   It just happened.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   I know.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   I felt like, how did I not know about this?
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.880]   Like, you just start throwing this stuff in.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.280]   It's also fairly smart because you can, for example, say like in Domino's, get me a pizza
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.200]   hungry and the Domino's apple go and get you a pizza.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.640]   And then you install pizza hut.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.200]   It won't let you say pizza hungry again because that's already assigned to Domino's,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.240]   you could say pizza hut hungry and then it'll order that for you.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   Not trust you.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   And you can overwrite in the beta.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.720]   I don't know if this will end up, but you can overwrite system things like say what time
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.680]   is it and make that order you a pizza.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.120]   But then if you say what is the time, it's smart enough to know that you're asking a
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.920]   different question and actually give you the time.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920]   Interesting.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   You were...
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:45.520]   So I read the slide at the keynote that they had somewhat backed down on the idea that this
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.000]   whole thing was entirely on the phone.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.200]   And mostly on the phone was how I read it.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.040]   There's stuff being sent back to the server.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.240]   You're saying though that it's completely anonymized in every case?
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.760]   So what happens is the minute you engage Syria creates an anonymous token for you and that
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.880]   wrapped up and sent over HTTPS to Apple and that that's associated for the length of that
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   command string.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.880]   But it's associated with your phone.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.560]   But that association breaks you anymore.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   Okay.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   And they don't know that it's Leo.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.200]   They just know it's like user 975, you know, 5786.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.680]   And that is not a persisting association.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.920]   That goes away.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.480]   It persists for a while.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.600]   I mean, you can kill any time you want just by restarting your phone, I believe.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.960]   But it will persist for a while so that it can put things together for you.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.200]   So very few people reboot their phone.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.640]   So it's going to persist as long as the phone has not been rebooted.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   That's my understanding.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.440]   And there is one case where Apple, like Apple used to be, I think, absolutist about privacy.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.240]   But there's a case where they're going to allow you to share...
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.080]   They've been doing a lot of research kit and health kit and medical records.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.640]   And they discovered that there are cases where there are people who are participating
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.440]   in research, for example, or receiving afterpatient care who just can't keep track of their own
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.960]   medication or don't have the ability to use the app to fill in vast amounts of things
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   into the app.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.800]   So if you give them express permission, they'll sort of intermediate that for you and take
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.040]   the data that's coming from health records and feed it into research, into whatever research
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.720]   kit app you have or whatever care kit service your institution is providing.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   Okay.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.200]   So in that case, it's against their normal privacy policy, but they think the benefits
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.800]   to the end user far exceed what their privacy policy means.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:30.320]   A lot of this is also in re-teaching the AI model that's powering all this so that the
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.240]   feature gets better for everybody.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.880]   So by communicating an optimized data back up to the server, at some point that the server
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.480]   can push down a smarter version of that model.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.320]   So it's better at scheduling things.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.200]   It's better at figuring out where you are and what you're likely to do in that place.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.920]   So it's not it's Apple seems to be finding out looking for a really good happy medium
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.760]   between the limitations of doing everything on device, even anonymized and the power,
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.840]   again, not just to the user, but basically to the feature itself to making sure that
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:06.200]   if your phone learns something, it can teach that thing to everybody else's phone.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:12.040]   But I mean, you have a whole article on so much more than the keynote, it says WWDC 2018.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.960]   And this is a great this is kind of this is kind of a lot of this though is like Renee's
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.880]   Renee's excellent adventure.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.200]   Another one called five things that Apple didn't announce, but we're really big like
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   they have map kit.js.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.000]   Sorry, map kit.js, which is the entirety of Apple Maps available now online and they're
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.320]   available cheaper right now, at least than Google Maps are.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.560]   And they're all written in WebGL.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.760]   So they're super fast and they have layers for interactivity and who would use that
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   developer.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.560]   So yeah, who want to put them either on a website or into an app because app tiles
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.280]   are as people who've been trying to use them for games and things know they can get stupid
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.360]   expensive really, really fast, especially as your user base scales.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.520]   So they basically wrote all they took all of Apple Maps and it had been available in
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.720]   small scales inside Apple's website and inside the WC app, for example.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.600]   But now it's available to everybody.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.760]   At no cost?
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.400]   No, so it's cheap.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   It's not free.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.040]   I think there probably is a free tier, but it's way less expensive.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.800]   There's a huge amount of impressions that you get for free.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.920]   And then if you want to go over those, you can contact Apple and I believe the pricing
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.560]   now is still substantially cheaper than what Google is offering.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.560]   That's probably smart.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.880]   And I presume it has Apple, oh, yet it has a little Apple in the lower left hand corner.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.160]   So there's a little Apple branding on there, which is smart because Google gets this brand
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.880]   out everywhere.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   That's interesting.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.320]   Yeah, there were a couple of things that just, there was just such a big show that a couple
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.600]   of things that Apple just didn't announce that were still, I thought, super interesting
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   in general.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.200]   Like even like Face ID on the iPhone 10 now, it doesn't revert you to just the pin code
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   immediately.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.440]   You can swipe up over and over again to make it retry as much as you want to.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   Oh, thank God.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.320]   And so I have a 20 character password and it's a pain.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   You know what?
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.240]   And they've fixed a lot of things that were also, instead of having to hold down and get
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.040]   the little X to kill an app, you can just swipe that app away like you could previously.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.040]   Oh, that was nice.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.040]   You should have been able to do.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.600]   And you can say Siri, turn on the flashlight finally if you're in a dark room.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   Oh, that's good.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   And I'm free.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.680]   There's a bunch of stuff in there that I think is, there's not everything.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.200]   Like there's a bunch of stuff that still haven't done.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.360]   But I think in whole iOS 12 and Mojave are looking really good.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.360]   You say, yeah.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.880]   If you were accidental screenshots on the iPhone 10, that's now.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.600]   I think that I think they put that in the beta.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.520]   So that this never happened to me because I guess because my hand isn't really long enough
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.920]   to go all the way to the top of the phone.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.600]   I turn off the time.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.720]   I mistake the camera for the off button and I keep turning off the camera when I want
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.720]   to use it.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.720]   That's my biggest.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   I do that all the time.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.840]   Like it's just like you go to take this perfect picture and you're like, then you take
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.840]   it and then it goes off.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.760]   You're like, ah, but a lot of people, when they pull out of their pocket, they squeeze
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.840]   both and take a screenshot.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.480]   So now for the first few seconds, when it detects it's just starting up, but will prevent
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.640]   you from taking any screenshots.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   Nice.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.640]   That's very good.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.680]   That's great.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.680]   This is good.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.680]   This is exciting.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:17.720]   I have to say, Siri shortcuts makes iOS 12 extremely interesting to me.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.520]   This is a lot of what they're doing.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.920]   I mean, you could get all excited about me, Moji's.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.880]   Although a lot of what they're doing is catch up to stuff that's out there or stuff you
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.760]   see on stacking notifications has been on Android.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.720]   But the do not disturb features will be on Android as well.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:38.600]   But I think Siri shortcut is unmatched on any platform.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:45.560]   And I think that you can run a program called Tasker and automate your Android device with
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.360]   a great effort.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.320]   You can do a lot of stuff, almost anything.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.520]   But the way they've implemented Siri shortcuts is to me extremely impressive.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.520]   I can't wait to try it.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.280]   I have a feeling it might be enough to push iOS over the top for me.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.280]   I think that what Apple does really well is we'll create something new out of something
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.480]   old by just adding a little bit more thought.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   Like a design.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:13.040]   And he's like, I looked at the FaceTime, you know, on during the keynote, the new FaceTime
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.960]   with 32 people or whatever.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.560]   And I was like, that is the craziest.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.960]   That was the craziest design I've ever seen.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.560]   I was like, I do not like that design at all.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.720]   But I was like, but I know they spent a lot of time on it.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.400]   So I have a feeling that I'm going to put it on and go, okay, it's kind of cool.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.760]   But it's not how I well, that's a perfect example.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.320]   Because they, I mean, they're duplicating Hangouts or a house party.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   Right.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.080]   It's not functionality nobody's had before, but it definitely looks different because
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.080]   of the fate in and out.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.120]   And the reason it's 32 people is because that's the limit of my message.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.720]   And they wanted, they never wanted you to say, I'm at all, we can only fit two less
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   people.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   Why Maxit?
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   Time.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   Why not Maxit?
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   Right.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   Right.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.080]   But the cool thing is like those bubbles and things really move well.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.160]   And they did like acceleration and de-acceleration curves.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.160]   So loud people wouldn't pop too aggressively.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.280]   I wish if someone was a troublemaker, you could pop their bubble and send them back
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.080]   to the staging ground at the bottom.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   But it doesn't.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.600]   And a lot of people have to go out is that people love that you could like put on an
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   effect.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.160]   So if you were woken up by a meeting, you could actually put on a fake face and not have to
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   worry about that.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   I like that.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   I really liked it.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.280]   I thought it was really cool that Memojis can be used in the real world.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.520]   And they look so good.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:21.400]   Well, I mean, we're going to be tired of them.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.400]   Don't worry.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.160]   Jim Dalrymple filed an angry radar that the beards weren't long enough.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.720]   I think he's easy to talk to the only ones who do that radar.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.600]   That's pretty funny.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.600]   That's pretty funny.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.760]   I'll the next feature for it is going to be so that like you can be in the middle of
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.520]   a chat and either because you're not really paying attention or because like your camera
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.520]   and the screen are like often a different way.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.080]   You can be like just basically looking at your phone checking messages, but your face
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.080]   is still going, "Uh-huh.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.080]   I'm paying attention."
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.080]   Yes, of course.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.080]   Really?
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.080]   That's the...
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.960]   And the performance stuff was legit.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.080]   I mean, they took some of the best engineers who were working on core parts of UIKit and
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.360]   they got them all to optimize it to make sure that tasks weren't being executed concurrently
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.800]   if they didn't have to, to make sure that things were moved to different parts of the
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.400]   process if they could be, to make sure the process are ramped up as fast as possible
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.800]   to deliver UI as fast as it could.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:17.360]   So I put it on my 6 Plus and it's amazing how perceptibly faster it is.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.160]   Do we know when iOS 12 beta will be publicly available?
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.160]   Before the end of the month.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.160]   Okay.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.160]   Pretty soon then.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.160]   We just...
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.920]   They just pushed out beta 3 of 1141.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.760]   Right?
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.600]   So that just came out today.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.680]   And the developer beta 2 just came out right before the show.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   Okay.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.680]   So soon.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.240]   So I'm going to go to public beta 3, 1141.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.720]   So maybe there'll be one more public beta and then the public 12.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.640]   I want to pull a reminder.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.720]   As a little reminder, I mean, the iOS 12 beta is remarkably solid for beta, but it's still
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.560]   a beta and I've had things like video features disappear until I rebooted three times.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.760]   So if you really depend on your phone, wait for that public beta.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   Yes.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.040]   Oh, no, that's me.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.280]   I'm not...
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.800]   I'm on the public beta track, not on the private beta developers.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   Let's just say I use my other phone, my older phone for any kind of GPS.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   I only have a lot of fun.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   I have to actually look at them.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   I'm like you.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   I have just the one.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   I have a couple.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   Well, I have different...
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.080]   Because we stream, I have to have...
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.960]   I cover all the services and so I have a phone in this T-Mobile phone that's AT&T and then
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   I just have a...
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.160]   And then my Android phone is Verizon.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.720]   So somebody in the chair says the rumor is tomorrow will be iOS 12 public beta.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.720]   I would not...
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.720]   That's my hope stuff.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   It's not an entirely impossible situation, but my feeling is that it's going to take a
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.160]   little while longer.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.960]   And how is it on the iPad?
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.960]   It's good.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.360]   It's weird because I feel like they shouldn't have done all those new gestures last year
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.120]   if they're just going to overwrite them with the iPhone X gestures this year.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.080]   Because I got so confused the first day trying to do basic gesture navigation on it.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.680]   Because now it works like an iPhone X.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.080]   Oh, actually I'm glad because I could never figure out the iPad gestures.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   I mean, good.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   That's good.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.680]   They need to unify it.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.320]   They've got to unify it.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.240]   I agree, but they did an intermediary step.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.000]   If they just not done that step and run straight to this, it's like they're trolling me with
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.400]   this gap between iPhone and iPad, like buttons in different places and UI gestures being
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.400]   different.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.680]   It's like a giant troll every year.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   We're probably going to switch from...
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.600]   Because we use Skype and Hangouts for our podcast now and I think we'll switch to FaceTime
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.360]   as soon as we can record it.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.320]   It looks so fun and you can...
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.720]   I know there's a lot of stuff you can do in Hangouts, but it's always like a web interface
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.200]   and Alex has said this before, but I feel like every three times we use it, they've moved
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.400]   some of the interface and we panic and can't find a basic function that we've been relying
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   on.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.680]   And this at least I feel like it'll be more limited than Hangouts, but we'll know exactly
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.720]   what we're getting every week and what we need to record with.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.880]   Somebody told me that if you've got the developer betas turned on for your Apple Watch, Walkie
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.880]   Talkie has just been pushed out.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.000]   I haven't been having nothing.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.160]   That is cool too because that uses the FaceTime protocol so it's end to end encrypted.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   Oh!
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.040]   I don't know that.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.400]   That's very cool.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.400]   It's just audio though.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.080]   Yeah, it's like pushed to talk FaceTime, FaceTime audio basically.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.080]   I like that.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.040]   But if it's only just point to point, right, just two people can do it.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.040]   Or is it a...
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.040]   Can you build a PO?
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.880]   See, that's interesting.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.320]   I don't know because I haven't been able to test it yet, but we'll try that out.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.800]   I don't know if it works for groups.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.840]   I know it's a person to person, but I don't know if it's a person to group, which would
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.320]   be handy at Disneyland.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.560]   Meet me at Mickey's hideout.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.960]   Okay, Splash Mountain.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:32.960]   Oh, Mickey's hideout.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.280]   I said the boy.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.280]   That is smart.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.960]   A lot of people actually, families own like a FRS band.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.960]   Exactly.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.120]   Because it's so much easier, so much faster, so much reliable than using phones.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.960]   Also, you're not going to get pop-up notifications on a $30 FRS radio.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.960]   Is this one last thing that...
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.960]   Go ahead.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.960]   Please.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   I was just going to say that one last thing that really impressed me that they didn't
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.000]   announce, and that is live listening for AirPods.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.240]   So instead, they've worked for hearing aids for years, you'll be able to do this.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.240]   But hearing aids, not everybody can afford them.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.840]   Everybody needs them all the time.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.840]   So you can put...
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.000]   If you go into Control Center, you can add a button that's called Live Listening, and
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.440]   then you open Control Center, you press that button, and whatever sound your iPhone microphone
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.000]   is picking up is live streamed to your AirPods.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.840]   So if you're having trouble hearing the TV, you can put it next to the TV.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.520]   You're in a lecture hall, and you can't hear the lecture, or you can put it there.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.440]   If you just need an emergency baby monitor while you're in the kitchen, you could put
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.600]   it next to the baby crib, and then walk to the kitchen, and you'll hear everything through
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.440]   your AirPods as it's happening.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.440]   That's going to be huge.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.440]   That's going to be the big thing.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.440]   The accessibility community loved that.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.440]   Oh, thrilled.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   And it's not just accessibility.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.440]   I think a lot of people will like that.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:44.080]   Some people were nervous saying it's remote spying, but you've had remote camera on your
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.000]   watch for a while, and you've like ten times zoomed to read lips across the street.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.920]   So you can misuse anything, but the amount of people who were hard of hearing, who just
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.880]   loved this un-announcement was spectacular.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:02.880]   Yeah, actually they have a lot of new features coming to the iPhone that are pretty exciting.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.440]   They've said that in the next, I'm not sure when this will happen, but maybe even in the
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:11.160]   next beta, they're going to have the lightning port disable after your screen is--
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   So they got for one hour.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   Off for an hour.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.160]   Which I thought made more, way more sense.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.040]   I think the first time I heard it was going to be a week or a couple days or something
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.200]   like that, but one hour seems like the right.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   Perfect, right?
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.720]   Yeah, and they say they can already circumvent that.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.760]   But it's hard to tell anymore what's real and what's fake with those companies.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.720]   Yeah, yeah, somebody said, "Oh, we can hack that."
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.640]   The reason is of course to defeat, sell-up right in other companies that are designed,
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.440]   have hardware designed to plug into the lightning port and take all the data out of the phone.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   I'm just curious how they're going to defeat the fact that they can't get in.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:49.280]   Well, their comment wanted us-- wanted the listener to believe that they have an underlying
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:55.760]   technology that renders a specific counterattack blunted.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.920]   They're trying to say not that, "Oh, we found this one weird trick that's along as
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.400]   Apple doesn't close it off.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.600]   Well, we'll be able to do this."
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.560]   The message they were trying to say underscore is that they had found something fundamental
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.360]   that it doesn't matter if Apple tries to patch it, which would imply some sort of a hardware
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.640]   hack that they found.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:20.400]   But like Renee says, realize that they are having a banner 2018 selling these devices
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.000]   from $15,000 to $30,000 to everybody who-- to every law enforcement agent that wants
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   to have them.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.480]   So the very first thing you want to do is get out in front and say, "Don't worry, whatever
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.960]   you have, you will still be able to break into people's phones."
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:40.720]   So I'm skeptical that they found something that it is possible that they found some way--
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.600]   based on just the splinters of things that they've said, it sounds like they try to
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.400]   put their own software on the device that renders aspects of-- so we all know springboard,
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.840]   but before springboard loads, before you type in your password for the first time, you're
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.960]   in preboard, which is sort of a more secure state of iOS that requires you to put in your
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.040]   passport, your passcode.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.040]   And it sounds like they found some way to interfere with that layer and remove a lot
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.240]   of the restrictions that usually stop you from locking out after too many fake passcodes.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.600]   And the same exploit might work to stop them from turning off the lightning port.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.920]   We just don't know, because, again, you can't trust anything they say.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:17.040]   This is a great shift, which is one of the companies selling these USB.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.640]   I'm kind of surprised Apple hasn't said, "Hey, this is your $500 million dollar day.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   Let me just suck you in."
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.320]   Well, how are you as an expert?
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.000]   Well, the other thing is that there is no indication that they can still work around
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.480]   a long passcode.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:38.480]   So if you just go from-- the people who still are relying on four-digit and six-digit zip
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.800]   codes, those people who are universally screwed always.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.080]   But if this is the time you decide to say that, guess what?
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.280]   The poem that I was forced to memorize in fifth grade that I've never forgotten, guess
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.280]   what?
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.920]   The first five words of that poem that I will never forget as long as I live, that's going
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.400]   to be my passcode.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.480]   Given that you've got fingerprint ID and face ID, you probably only have to type it
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.760]   in maybe once every three or four days, that's probably going to be the safest way around
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   this.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:13.680]   Yeah, Grayshift's device, brute forces, the code, but they have two strategies.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.040]   One is BfU and one is AfU.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.240]   Before first unlock is a slow brute force, 10 minutes per try.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.400]   Well, good luck if you've got 10,000 choices.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.480]   That gives access to limited data.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:34.400]   That's when the phone is off, you know, when the cops get it or whoever gets it.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.200]   But then the AfU is a fast brute force that kicks in when the phone is locked, but was
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.040]   turned on and unlocked at some point by the owner.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:47.400]   In this case, it allows for 300,000 tries and parallel extraction of pre-unlocked data.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:55.200]   So those would both be defeated by this lightning port fix, which is apparently already in the
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.960]   current beta, 11.4.1b and 12b.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:06.360]   And then if they get around it, if you have, you're saying, Andy, if you have a long, strong
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:11.200]   password, not a four digit code, they're not able to force it at all.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.640]   Also, this isn't like some of the hacks they've got going for Android devices where they're
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:21.520]   inexpensive enough to deploy and fast enough and easy enough that a lot of police officers
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.280]   are using, or excuse me, a lot of departments are using the idea that if I, if you have
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.960]   given me permission to search your car and your phone is inside your car, that means
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.600]   I have permission to search your phone, they might have a box back at the car, back at
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.240]   their squad car that will be able to just say, well, maybe we probably won't be able
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.280]   to crack this phone in less than three minutes, but let's just plug it in anyway as a matter
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   of course.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.400]   This isn't that sort of a thing.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.160]   It's still really complicated.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.960]   It's still very, very expensive.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:54.080]   It's not so, it's not so affordable that they, that they would have it on like a car by car
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.880]   as opposed to a department by department thing.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:05.120]   And for the most part, he said, italicizing that phrase, law enforcement keeps, has had
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:10.200]   the position that they don't use these devices for just fishing expedition sort of searches.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:16.000]   It really is when they feel, it's basically a departmental resource and they don't have
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.680]   the resources to simply send lots of phones there, just as a matter of course, it's a
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   selective sort of thing.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.040]   But again, that's italicized sort of thing.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.880]   The crackers that work on Android are a much bigger problem.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:32.680]   This is more of a, again, easy, expensive to, expensive to use, maybe not even going
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:37.480]   to work, not so foolproof that they would want to use it on every single device after
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.160]   determining that no, we didn't get in the first five minutes.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.520]   So, but still something that I'm sure, I'm sure the engineers at Apple who have bought
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.800]   them through just three layers of shell companies are having a good time tearing this thing
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   apart.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.880]   If you go into your phone, if you have the beta on, if you go into your phone, I'm on
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.880]   my iPhone 10.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.880]   So it says face ID and passcode older phones and not pencils say touch ID and passcode
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:07.880]   and you scroll down under allow access when locked, there's this setting for USB accessories.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:14.720]   And if, if correct me if I'm wrong, if I have this turned off, that means that USB accessories
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.560]   will not be able to, it says unlock phone to allow USB accessories to connect when it
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.960]   has been more than an hour since your phone was locked.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.480]   So if it's been more than an hour, having this turned off protects me, is that right?
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.480]   Am I in the right setting?
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.480]   The blue setting corrects.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.560]   It's not immediately clear, but I think the idea is that off not on.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.960]   Some people get nervous, but there is a setting that says erase your phone after 10 tries
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.720]   and people are like, oh, my kid's going to do it and I'll lose my phone or my jerk friend
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.360]   at the bar is going to put it in.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.720]   But the amount of delays that pile up after the fourth and fifth and sick the 10, I think
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.120]   it takes three or four hours to actually get to 10 attempts.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.240]   So you are really safe leaving that on.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.840]   There is no funny in your life who is going to do that to you unless they really want
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.840]   to cause problems.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.400]   I have two iPads sitting in my office right now.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.400]   I have to go to the Apple store because they won't unlock for 64 years or something like
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   that.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.400]   What did you do Alex?
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   My kids were trying to log into it.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.080]   Unless you're Alex's kid.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:16.160]   The other thing is if you have a backup of which you should have of your phone and the
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.880]   day that gets erased, you can restore it, right?
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.080]   Let me ask you this question.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.920]   This comes up because Paul Manafort is in jail right now because he used iCloud to back
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.800]   up his phone and it turned out he backed up his WhatsApp messages and there was a smoking
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.120]   gun in there.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.600]   A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.320]   When you know that WhatsApp encrypts your messages end to end, but you don't know that
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.440]   iCloud backups are stored unencrypteded well.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.440]   Oops.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:49.320]   And the contrary to what the Department of Justice says, Apple is very much willing
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:54.480]   to help out law enforcement if they come to them with the appropriate paperwork for iCloud.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.680]   Oh, so here's my question though.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   If Manafort had checked the box that says encrypt the backup, would Apple then be still
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.960]   able to hand that iCloud backup to law enforcement or no?
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:10.560]   So my understanding is that Apple defaults to fail safe for backups not to fail secure
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.760]   because they believe that the biggest problem people face is losing their photos or losing
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.480]   their documents or losing their returns.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.720]   If you really want security, they encourage you to connect to iTunes, do a secure backup
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.880]   locally on device.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.400]   The cloud thing is meant to be like a brainless like to send a backup.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.960]   So all iCloud backups are unencrypted.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.200]   There's nothing you can do about that.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.240]   They're encrypted to Apple, not through Apple.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.240]   Yes.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.040]   So they trust no one Apple has the keys.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.840]   No one can intercept them while you're sending them to Apple, but they are stored in Apple
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.680]   servers and Apple's policy is, you know, we don't want to have any more of your data
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.440]   than we absolutely have to because we don't want to ever have to turn it over.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.560]   But this is you saying we want to backup our stuff and we're going to keep it safe and
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.320]   secure for you, but it's on our servers now.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.520]   And if someone gives us a warrant, we have to turn that over.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:01.960]   So not to help criminals by any means, but for your own personal use, if you want to
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:08.000]   be fully secure, don't backup your iOS devices to iCloud, back them up locally.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.160]   Or be selective, like turn on iCloud photo library and turn off what you can choose on
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.720]   an app-by-app basis, what gets backed up.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.600]   So you can go and turn off WhatsApp and turn off anything that you want to keep an eye
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   message.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.320]   I turn off backup to iCloud for the general thing because anyway, I don't want to waste
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.320]   iCloud space.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.520]   I have a lot more of hard drive space locally.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.760]   So I don't back up to iCloud.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.560]   It's convenient, but it's not secure.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.920]   And then if you're people who forget to do their backups.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.760]   Yeah, it's convenient, not secure.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.920]   Not cheap either because you have to pay for the storage.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.600]   If you're going to back it up to your local drive though, do turn on encrypted backups,
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:48.880]   use a good password, use file vault, turn that on, and then I saw somebody recommending,
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:56.240]   I'm not sure, this is a Black Diamond tip, recommending a firmware password as well on
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.280]   your Apple.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.880]   That way they can't take the hard drive out.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.040]   I think if you have file vault on, you're probably going to be there.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   Yeah, they can't take it.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.960]   It's there, but I've never heard anybody say it really improves your security by using
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:07.960]   it.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.600]   The encryption thing is really nice though, and the iTunes backup because then it stores
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.080]   all your passwords and stuff.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.520]   And when you restore it, you don't have to go through every app.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.120]   Some of them might disappear because the tokens expire, but mostly you'll get a lot
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.680]   of your passwords and account information back.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.920]   So this is an article on I'm more from three years ago, but I think it's still good.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.320]   Peter Cohen wrote, "How to set your Macs firmware password and why you shouldn't."
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.680]   Peter knows this Macs.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.280]   I mean, for some people, this is something to keep in mind.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.280]   I think if you use it.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   Some business has mandated.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   Some of your employers mandated.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:44.840]   I do this on Windows machines, but if you're using BitLocker on Windows machines or file
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.920]   vault on Mac and Tush, no hacker is going to be able to get your data out of there unless
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.800]   he gets your login.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:57.920]   So depending on how secure you want it to be, but yeah, backup locally, then you don't
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.000]   have to worry about it.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.360]   Or like, again, if you are nervous about things like your family photos because it's
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   literally a little bit too funny to happen.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.360]   Yeah, I do.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   I do the photo library.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   Do the music library.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.560]   Do anything that you don't care about.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.560]   Right.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.720]   Or that's more important to be safe than to be secure.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.240]   Who cares if the feds get my photos or my music?
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.760]   I think they'll enjoy my music.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:21.160]   Oh, oh, the playlist is on point.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:26.880]   The other thing that they've done, which is, or are going to do, which is pretty exciting,
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.680]   might save your life.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.320]   But I have some questions about this.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:37.440]   You're going to start offering GPS coordinates, high resolution GPS coordinates to 911 calls
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.400]   on your iPhone.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   Right?
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.840]   Yeah, I didn't look too much into that, but by law, they have to do a lot of stuff for
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:47.840]   911.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.840]   I think they're improving the quality.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.840]   This is something new.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.600]   And I've been, yeah, okay, good.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:58.240]   This is something in iOS 12 that Apple put out a press release.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.040]   It automatically will share your iPhone location during 911 calls.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:09.120]   The issue, the Apple calls it, Apple's hybrid emergency location system or Hilo, that was
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.800]   launched in 2015.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:19.600]   And if your 911 center supports Hilo, that will help get help to you faster.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   But Apple says that they're going to do something that will build on that to make it even better.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.880]   So it's not, I'm not immediately clear, but automatically-
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.880]   They're going to hold a bunch of-
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.320]   Like they're doing those things.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.480]   Like for a while now, they've done a thing where you hold down the buttons that'll make
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.800]   a 911 call for you.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:38.200]   I think their point is that if you're in an accident and you only have your watch on
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.440]   you, you only have your phone on you, they want to be able to get emergency services to
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.440]   you as fast as possible.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.160]   And I was surprised that you, you know, I didn't, you know, I should have known this,
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:52.360]   but I didn't know that 911 responders are generally trained to, if you say, if you call
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.240]   and say you want a pizza, they'll start asking you questions that only require yes and no
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.240]   answers.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   Yes.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.760]   You know, and, and so, you know, that kind of is a way to, and especially combine with
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:06.080]   GPS, it's useful to be able to tell, tell them exactly where you are and you're in trouble.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.480]   And of course, many of times you can, you can place the call, but you can't talk.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.520]   You're having a heart attack.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.080]   You can't talk.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.080]   Or right.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.120]   You can't talk because there's other people in the room holding a gun to your head.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:21.600]   But the, the idea of, of course, getting first to respond to your faster also has to do
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.680]   with the fact that a cell phone isn't where always at home.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.840]   It's not like a landline.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:26.840]   Right.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:27.840]   And it uses E9-11.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.920]   I know the FCC has mandated location information.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.240]   And I think as of a couple of years ago, they want to get it pretty accurate.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.080]   They have, there's E9-11, which you probably heard of.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.800]   There is phase one and now we're in, now there's phase two rules that basically says
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:47.120]   that if a dispatch, if a, if a 911 dispatch center tells a carrier, like a local carrier,
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:52.800]   like Verizon or AT&T that, hey, look, we want really, really fine grain results, they have
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.280]   to be able to, within six months, they have to comply with that and start providing that
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.280]   information.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.480]   I was trying to figure out, I was trying to, when Apple announces, I was trying to figure
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:06.640]   out what exactly they were talking about because that was, that, that sort of hits the wall
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.920]   of my understanding of E9-11 system where it will give, in that it's designed to give
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.720]   you, it's designed to allow the carriers to provide information up to the limits of what
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.960]   the onboard GPS can provide.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:24.280]   However, given that we've got so much beacon information, both Google and Apple Maps are
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.400]   trying to figure out if you're inside a mall, what floor of the mall are you on, what store
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.320]   are you in, or if probably, more importantly, if you're in an apartment building, again,
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:38.680]   what apartment are you in, what place are you in, I'm trying to figure out, it's, I'm
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.240]   trying to figure out how they might be conveying that information to a 911 dispatcher.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:47.680]   But as, as when, excuse me, as, as Alex said, they're under, they've got so many rules
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:53.520]   at the, at dispatch, including a lot of us have at some point accidentally tap the wrong
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.400]   speed dial button on a parent's phone and then, so, no, everything's fine, everything's
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.480]   fine, but nonetheless, we get, we get some rollers coming about five minutes later because
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.560]   they have to check it out if they have the manpower.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.320]   This is from Apple's press release.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:11.680]   The FCC requires carriers to locate callers to within 50 meters, at least 80% of the time
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.160]   by 2021.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.920]   So a couple of years, three years from now, iOS location services are capable of exceeding
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.160]   this requirement today, even in challenging dense urban environments.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:27.200]   This new feature allows Apple to make these benefits available to local 911 centers now,
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.120]   rather than years from now, it uses something called RapidSOS, which is another company's
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.120]   system.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:38.480]   Apparently, it's widely used in 911 centers existing software.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.760]   So essentially, if they're using Rapid, if they have RapidSOS capability, they'll get
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.120]   highly accurate location information.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:52.160]   And most likely this accuracy is going to skyrocket when 5G comes out because 5G is
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.440]   much smaller cells.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:58.720]   So, you know, 5G cell, from my understanding, only goes about 250 feet.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:04.040]   So, you know, so instead of one big cell tower that's covering a big open area, you've
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:09.680]   got lots of these little transceivers that are going to spread out like exceeds.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:14.040]   And because of that, they're going to be able to, the 5G network will know where you are
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.560]   down to a couple of meters.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.560]   Maybe less.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:18.560]   It's better than you do.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.560]   It's good.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:25.400]   So this is so, as you said, Andy, it's not immediately clear how widespread, you know,
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   how many people are using RapidSOS, how widespread this will be.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.440]   The problem with regional centers, which is what E9-1-1 uses is that they then have
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.040]   to hand you off to a local 9-1-1.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   So that's less useful.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:40.960]   So I'm not sure how much this will help, but anything that improves the response time
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.920]   for a 9-1-1 call, of course, is going to save lives.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.880]   Earlier today on iOS today, Meghan said that, what did she say?
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:53.000]   A one-minute improvement in response time will save 10,000 lives a year.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.640]   So it's a significant difference.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:01.120]   And it really does point out how important getting these better fine-grained maps are.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.200]   Google was talking recently about the difficulty of not just making sure they have a street
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:14.120]   address, but figuring out through street map car, 3D photographs, and basically cell phone
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.280]   use tracking, where is the entrance to this building?
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.280]   Yes.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.080]   Because you can be at the right address, but you have to go, but you're like two stoplights
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.320]   away from actually figuring out how to get inside this building.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.120]   That is a problem for 9-1-1, as well as pizza delivery.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.720]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:38.400]   Quick and Lones, the best lender in the country, rated number one online mortgage lender by

[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:52.840]   Quick and Lones is going to get bigger still because of this Rocket Mortgage because it's
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.000]   something we geeks love.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.280]   The idea that instead of going to a bank to get a loan, taking days, weeks, months, you
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:05.560]   can get a loan on your phone in minutes by going to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.

[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.680]   And there's really, this is, I mean, it's crazy that we've had to do it any other way.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.160]   This is the 21st century.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:33.640]   Let's have a technologically sophisticated way to apply for a home loan.

[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:59.640]   Rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:06.960]   We thank him so much for, I'm sorry about the Cleveland Cavalier's debt, but we are happy
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.840]   that you support our podcast still.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:15.400]   I probably shouldn't rub salt in the loan, should I?
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.400]   Apple.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:25.320]   Totally surprising, Apple has decided that sitting is the new cancer as we all sit and
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:32.600]   they are going to provide standing desks to every employee at the brand new Apple park.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.400]   The good news is that they aren't forced to stand.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.480]   It is an adjustable stand or sit desk.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.440]   So I guess that's kind of okay.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:50.120]   But the medical science on this has been backing down from the idea of sitting is the new cancer,
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:54.840]   that moderate activity kind of counteracts it, although there are health risks involved
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.360]   with sitting all the time.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:02.120]   I think that all you got to do is make sure that there's really, really inexpensive vending
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.680]   machines on every floor.
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:07.040]   People will get up from time to time and prevent blood costs.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.360]   It's the easiest way to deal with it, I think.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:13.840]   We offer our employees standing desks too, because we don't want them to get cancer of
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.320]   the butt or whatever it is.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:20.080]   This comes from an interview Tim did with Bloomberg with David Rubenstein.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:23.880]   He says, "We have given all of our employees 100% standing desks.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.760]   If you could stand for a while, then sit and so on and so forth, it's much better for your
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.760]   lifestyle."
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.640]   Cook previously described sitting as the new cancer.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:37.640]   This was when he was talking about the Apple really, because of that stand thing in the
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.640]   Apple Watch.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.240]   Apple really has a thing about sitting.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:46.040]   We'll still have the Deepak Chopra.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.080]   The Deepak breathe app on the watch, which is silly.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.880]   Not again, not a bad idea, but I don't sure if I'd need to have something that's adorable.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:54.880]   It's a favorite app.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.040]   George, of course, would love it.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:59.800]   Here's a picture of the way these work.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.520]   This was built in when they built Apple Park.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.440]   They're buttoned underneath and they can raise it and lower it.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.440]   It's pretty cool.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.280]   It's a series of podcasts for a while with a guy who was a physiotherapist who found
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.240]   his postural therapy system.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.520]   The very first one he wanted to do was standing desks.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.600]   He said, "Basically, if you're sitting down all the time, it's like being in outer space.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.680]   Your muscles are atrophying you, but all this body structure that for years was designed
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.640]   to keep you up and to press against gravity.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.280]   All of that goes away when you're sitting.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   The best thing you can do is just get up and sit and walk and do all these things.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   Move around.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   We don't.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.920]   I'm a huge fan of this.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.280]   Obviously, work your way up to it.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.120]   I've used standing desks for over a decade.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.960]   Don't go all in on it.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.640]   You can increase the intensity by putting uneven surfaces underneath where you stand.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.160]   So you're forced to balance yourself while you do it.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.360]   You can take it overboard.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.520]   My boss, Kevin, has a treadmill desk where you're standing up on the treadmill.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.960]   That's going way too far, I'm sorry.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.960]   Use it for conference calls.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.200]   You can't type on it yet.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.040]   The idea is that we were the obstacle courses are like the best thing to do.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.040]   Go to the park.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.040]   Watch kids.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040]   They're amazing at this.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.040]   They never stop.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.040]   They're always in motion.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.040]   They're climbing.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040]   They're exploring.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.040]   They're moving.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040]   They're running.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040]   They're just not sitting.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   It's so much better for you.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   Sorry.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   I'm really passionate about this.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.040]   If sitting is the cancer, I sit on a ball.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.040]   I probably just don't have cancer.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.880]   I just have like a, I don't know, right?
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.320]   But that's kind of the same thing, right?
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   I'm moving a little bit.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.320]   I'm not.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   You're forced to stabilize your foot.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   But it's really like the muscles in your legs.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:33.200]   I notice when I go to my trainer, he's always saying, "Oh, your hips are out of alignment.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.760]   You've been sitting all day again."
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   I really do.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.320]   No, I don't sit on my wallet.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.840]   I'm not that stupid.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.160]   I got room related to the rest of it.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.320]   Mine's really thick.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.320]   I don't know.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.800]   I'm just kidding.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.000]   My solution is I still have my, I'm sitting on it right now.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.640]   I bought like an actual, like at a thrift store, like a middle school, like sort of like steel
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.280]   and steel chair.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.840]   I don't know what you'd recognize it immediately if I showed it to you.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.720]   And it's just comfortable enough that it's comfortable to sit in, while I work in a
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   second type.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   But it's not padded.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.880]   There's nothing like, like, it's, there's nothing padded.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.840]   So I'm not encouraged to sit in it for more than an hour at a time.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840]   It gets a little bit.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.120]   I'm usually, you can, on the video feed, you can sometimes see me like shifting a little
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.120]   in the chair.
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.960]   So I'm always moving a little bit.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.640]   And they're after like an hour and a half, I'm not in pain.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.120]   I just feel like walking, getting up and walking around for a little bit.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.400]   So there are a lot of different ways to, I did, I have tried standing desks.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:37.080]   I just get so distracted by the, I just don't like them for some reason.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.800]   The other thing Apple did is they didn't, Johnny, I didn't want to have the chairs be
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.000]   too comfortable.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.800]   So that you'd be more likely to get up and move around.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:52.720]   So instead of using the air on chairs that every high tech company uses, they got these
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:03:00.320]   chairs from Vitra that are only a thousand dollars that are more like living room chairs
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.920]   and less specific.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.040]   I'm not sure which one they got here.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.920]   I also have a lot of Hiroshima chairs, the wooden ones.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   Hiroshima chairs.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.520]   If you search for it, they're, they're the ones you see in the cafeterias and all the
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.520]   conference rooms.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.080]   They're really beautiful single.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.440]   They look like single piece of wood carvings.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]   Ah.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.320]   I go with their fancy tables.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:28.240]   So if so, so, so, so basically the ultimate ideal for them is to go get those chairs
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:33.040]   that are in like some of those McDonald's where they, the seat leans a little bit forward.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.080]   So you really don't, you really don't want to sit there for more than 25 minutes and you
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.080]   want to kind of be.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.440]   Actually, I thought they would be, I thought they'd be horrible, but the last event, we
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.000]   were all sitting there afterwards for so long.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.520]   It must have been like four or five hours and I didn't notice I was in a wooden chair.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.320]   I thought it'd be the worst thing in the world, but it was.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.320]   They don't look that comfortable.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   I have to say is that.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.320]   No, they look horrible.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.320]   They look horrible, but they're actually really.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.320]   They're pretty.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.320]   They're pretty.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.320]   I mean, but they look hard.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.320]   They look very hard.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320]   It's not, it's not all.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.680]   And the other problem is that when you have like these really highly like cushion engineered
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.840]   chairs, the cushioning breaks down the springs like stretch out and suddenly.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   Oh, it's so true.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.920]   And after a couple of years, it really is kind of bad for you.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:17.080]   Whereas, whereas the one thing that this, the chair I'm in has, it just has the, it has
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.520]   like the back piece is kind of like almost exactly in the middle, like sort of lower
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.520]   my back.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.200]   So that's where like it gets really, really comfortable.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.080]   Like it also puts me in the mind of being in English class and you know, leading right
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.440]   back to hear that little crack.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.440]   Yes.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.400]   So which one, wait a minute, which one should we get?
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.720]   Do we get one with a cushion or is that too posh?
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720]   They don't have the cushions.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   No, they don't.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   There's no cushions.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.920]   There's no cushions on the apple ones.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.360]   So that would be probably Hiroshima 2955 stroke 31.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   That looks like it.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:53.440]   I'm just, oh, I'm just like that like Captain Raymond Holt.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.960]   You can get it in the beach.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.560]   Oak or walnut?
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.400]   What should we get?
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.400]   Walnut?
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.800]   Ooh, that wouldn't be good for as tabletop slingshotting though.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.560]   No, rose gold rose gold.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.560]   Wow.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.960]   Jacket, jacket coat jacket.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.960]   Is this a please, please think.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.720]   I don't have a, they don't have a price on here, but you got to think thousand bucks
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.720]   easy, right?
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.720]   If you can get them.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720]   I mean, I'm sure they're not that easy.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.720]   You can't just walk in a Walmart and pick those up.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.720]   Wow.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720]   Wow.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   All right.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.400]   I just wonder like, I just wonder like you apple walks in and goes, yes, thank you.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.400]   We'll take 10,000.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   What?
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   We only ever sold 30.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.800]   Yeah, our whole lives.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:42.560]   Bob, speaking of new design, new design on the apple store orders page.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:48.360]   So go and buy a home pod just to see what it looks like.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.360]   Right.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.360]   I've encountered it yesterday.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.360]   Congratulations.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.360]   Thank you.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.360]   I'm Canadian French yet.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.600]   How much is it in Canada?
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.320]   450 Canadian, which I think is like what?
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.320]   $25 US.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   I don't remember.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   What is the?
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320]   That's interesting.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   450.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.320]   So it's 50 bucks more.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.320]   That's not too bad.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.560]   That's not too bad.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.560]   Let me see.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560]   Let me see.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.160]   And what I didn't know, but I should have suspected is that apple as apple music editors
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.040]   in every country and they're, they're staging them with a home pod layout.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.960]   So there's like an apple music team in Quebec who's like going to Shabugamoo and Shawinigan
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.880]   and Richmond Vancouver and finding the hot local bands and making sure they feature
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.960]   them and work with them and try to help them make playlists for them and feature sections
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:33.200]   for them so they get like this whole local feel built around the product launch.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.520]   This is a little new too in the, in the store.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:43.200]   They're now featuring a user, a photographer right in the front page there of the store.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.240]   That's the new behind the Mac campaign they launched.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.840]   I forget when they launched that.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.240]   It was like Thursday last Thursday last Friday.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.240]   Something like that.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:57.280]   These are these are these are the developer from a one to Alex or one in developer.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.880]   You go to apple.com slash you too.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.360]   Elon Musk's girlfriend.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.600]   She's she must be hip.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.800]   Elon dated her and now she's on the front page of Apple store must be hip.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.560]   They have a video that shows all of them.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:17.160]   If you go to youtube.com/apple they have a new behind the it's their effort to put some
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.760]   love back in the app marketing cycle.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:23.080]   Let me buy a Mac book here and just see what the new experiences like looks the same so
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.080]   far.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.480]   Like a fourth a fourth generation Intel processor.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:34.960]   You know I actually we have a couple and I just want to get one with ports but the screen
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.960]   I can't you know it's just no it scratches your eyes.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.160]   It hurts my eyes.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.800]   I can't get such a low res screen.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.160]   It's noticeably low res it looks blurry.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.400]   I don't know how this is different.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.080]   This looks exactly the same to me but apparently it's redesigned somehow.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.080]   That's problematic.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:59.000]   I was I actually reactivated a phone from like five years ago for various reasons.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.640]   It was like my last pre like my last pre retina display and I'm like my god Apple still
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.120]   sells a laptop with exactly this kind of display.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   It was like okay.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.680]   This is September.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.800]   It's September.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.320]   Well love again.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:24.160]   Apple camp reservations opening up if you want to go to camp this summer.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.160]   Oh good.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.960]   Oh how exciting.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.640]   Apple opens up summer 2018 Apple camp reservations.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.280]   They opened up yesterday.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:38.160]   It's an annual retail program aimed at teaching kids while exposing them and their parents
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.080]   to Apple products.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:49.240]   US Canada France several other countries sessions begin July 9th and cycling through July 27th.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:52.440]   Program limited to 12 last year or the year before they like it.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:56.840]   They learned there was an eye movie in a garage band track and they tried both of them and
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.320]   they ended up making movies and they still make them to this day.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.120]   I mean they still sit there and they make stop motion animation.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:07.320]   I think I just figured out that with the new version of pages because it's object oriented
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.360]   you can draw something and then circle the parts you want to move and screen record and
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.080]   make like these whole animated stories just inside.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.520]   So there's coding with sphero robots.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.080]   Uh as a final project the kids will design their own games.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.840]   Beat making and songwriting with garage band.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.400]   That sounds pretty cool and telling stories with clips instead of a movie they're going
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:34.520]   to do clips to combine media into into exciting videos.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.960]   Now it's free but the slots fill it fast so so parents if you want to I think this would
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.160]   be a great thing for a kid eight to twelve.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.040]   Yeah for adults I think they're doing prototyping they're often going to start offering prototyping
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.160]   design courses which is pretty cool.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:52.200]   Yeah that's what yeah what about us what about the sixty to eighty set when do we get
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.200]   sort of ignored.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.000]   Yo when do we get some classes.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.880]   No as soon as that prototyping classes up I'm going to go try it because I've seen their
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.960]   prototyping workshops at WWC and they're amazing.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:06.480]   Prototyping courses like so one of the ones I saw was they were trying to make a toaster
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.840]   app and they were showing you how they use keynote to mock up the interface and then
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.520]   had someone behind a couch pushing up the toaster so you could feel like how the interaction
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.320]   would be when you're pressing app.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.240]   How fun.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.240]   That's really cool.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.320]   Yeah they have a really cool prototyping team you can find some of the old dub dub sessions
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.520]   are really fun to watch.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.640]   Apple being fine in Australia for the year fifty three controversy this was the issue that
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:34.160]   if you had a third party repair your iPhone you'd get an error fifty three apple said
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:39.680]   that's for security reasons because we can't be sure that the store that the phone is still
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:45.400]   secure once the touch ID has been replaced.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.960]   Apparently there's a violation of Australian law.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.880]   In fact in June of last year the Australian competition and consumer commission had an
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:01.200]   undercover operation thirteen calls with apple retails in Australia and they recorded apple
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.400]   representatives saying that apple did not have a responsibility to remedy faulty iPhones
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.640]   if you had it repaired by an authorized third party.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:16.280]   Apples admitted to it and they're being fined relatively paltry six point eight million
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.080]   US dollars nine million Australian dollars.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.080]   Good.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.680]   You get full bad information.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.960]   Yeah I don't understand.
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:31.880]   Like how can how can a you know once you have an unauthorized party mess with a piece of electronics
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.560]   I don't understand how the company is still accountable for well I guess I don't think
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.000]   it is in the US because that's silly.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.040]   Apparently it is.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.400]   You don't know who says they can fix your phone and then they break it.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.360]   How is the manufacturer you know accountable for that that doesn't make any sense.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.280]   Well they're not they weren't they weren't saying that you have to replace the the really
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.480]   bad screen that is the incompatible screen that was drawing too much voltage they're
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:00.800]   basically saying that if it's that if in that in that situation if it could be fixed
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.400]   by replacing it with a new screen yes you can yes yes the customer will have to pay for
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.640]   that repair but you can't simply say that this this this phone is absolutely a dead
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.400]   phone to us we will never fix it it will never work again we will never touch it again.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.760]   There is sort of it just underscores that there is an obligation to not be not be ootsy
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.960]   about this not be cute and adorable about this and say that if you ever take this anywhere
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.600]   else but an authorized service center you will never be able to get it fixed by a legit
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.600]   service center ever again and that's unnecessary and ridiculous and I guess I guess I guess
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.520]   I'm used to professional equipment is that way to my world is you touch there's like
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.240]   all stickers on some of our equipment you break that sticker and they will never look
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:44.320]   at you know so I'm using that as a lot of me a lot of government like it makes sense
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:47.840]   from a custom company point of view because like at their risk adverse and they think
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.240]   that if you scooted that phone they have never know the full depth of your screen with that
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.160]   phone and they'll replace that screen and then you'll come back with something else
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.640]   and now they're on the hook because their warranty is it started covering the screen
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.800]   and they don't and becomes a whole thing and they did rather avoid but many countries
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.320]   have laws that say you can't you can't do that and even though it doesn't make sense
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.440]   from a mechanical like if you're the person repairing it you're all nervous that it's
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.280]   going to explode in your hands but the law says that they still have to FTC says it in
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:17.680]   the US warranty avoid if remove stickers are not legal so Alex you want to know that
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:24.040]   you might want to bring those devices back in yeah yeah I wouldn't trust them again
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.640]   you should actually see put six companies on notice saying by the way I think one of
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:34.240]   them was Sony for their PlayStation that their warranty practices violate federal law
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.640]   if you buy a car with a warranty take it to repair shop to fix it then have to return
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.400]   the car to the manufacturer the car company in the US anyway isn't legally allowed to
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:48.240]   deny the return because you went to another shop the same is true so I guess it's true
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:54.640]   here of any consumer device it costs more than five dollars thanks to the 1975 Magnus
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:00.920]   and Moss warranty act so those stickers warranty the
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.000]   tractor stuff you know John Deere and yeah that's yeah this is the right to repair
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   issue yeah this is different so that's interesting see FTC says you know you can't say no
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:21.040]   to repair their apples design precludes such stickers but Apple geniuses are trained to
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:25.520]   look for the signs of consumer meddling and will sometimes decline warranty service if
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:29.600]   it's been repaired by an owner or third party they can decline warranty service they can
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.640]   charge you for it but they don't want you to refuse service of any kind and the other
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.480]   flip side is that some technicians don't want to work on this stuff because it's got like
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.160]   a lithium-ion battery in it they don't know if you've changed that if it's going to burn
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.240]   you know they're they're being incredibly risk adverse which is too far the other way
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.080]   and there's probably some happy middle ground where they can cover the base repair there's
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.520]   something wrong with it you still have to pay for additional repairs your their their
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.680]   repair warranty doesn't cover additional damage to that device and there were a couple of
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.120]   different dimensions to that warranty void of sticker removed law part it was that just
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:05.200]   simply arguing that the the owner of this device did not agree to those terms can't just
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.560]   simply say you just can't simply print something on its own on a label saying oh by the way
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.520]   you've just agreed to this by virtue of the fact that you've seen the sticker but there
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:19.560]   were there were there were also important important knock-on effects regarding what you
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.760]   can do to a device you actually own and what's where the legal responsibilities of a of a
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:29.280]   company and that that really is the basic principle that do I own this computer or did
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.360]   I just give apple or Sony or whatever two thousand dollars for a license to use this
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:38.800]   thing that they still have rights over and that's a that's a dangerous dangerous ground so
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.640]   I'm glad that various companies are sitting on this maybe super interesting because we'll
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.160]   soon have self-driving cars and are you gonna be allowed to repair like self repair your
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:50.480]   self-driving car then has to work as part of a high mind with everybody I get we're moving
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:57.040]   to a whole new realm of technology has an Audi that has cameras in the mirrors that you
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:02.560]   use for parking and driving and some schmuck knocked your mirror off happens all the time
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.560]   in a car right now it's upset all the time well it's a big deal if you knock the mirror
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.240]   off and the mirror was finally able to snap it back but it broke the blinker which had
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:16.760]   to be fixed and it broke the camera so we had it actually didn't break the camera but
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:21.840]   we had the mirror fixed and then the auto body shop says but it's not you can't drive
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:28.440]   it you have to bring it to Audi to get the cameras recalibrated right to which Lisa said
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:34.280]   I've been driving cars without cameras for 20 years give me my car and they said okay
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:40.400]   but but I but I think there is that conception that if you if you ruin the integrity of the
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.920]   self-driving systems why I can say that this is why we don't why we don't rent equipment
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.600]   you know like why I don't know where like I don't rent it I don't want my stuff out
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.520]   I don't want other people stuff very often because I'm always you know generally 10%
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.200]   20% of the stuff that you rent and it doesn't work right you know and so it's and it's because
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.160]   you don't know where that well it's been so there is a federal law good luck getting it
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:11.040]   enforced right the FTC is kind of busy right now but it is against the law it's intro the
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.120]   Magnus and Moss warranty active there you go it's a it's complicated this is the yet
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:20.640]   another example of brand new technology that absolutely cannot handle the limitations of
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:25.720]   laws that were passed even just 10 years ago yeah I think the European instant you're like
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:32.360]   the European version of the I'm sorry the British version of the the highway crash insurance
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.160]   highway safety safety is to the United States you know the crash test video people just published
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:41.280]   a paper a couple weeks ago on crash on crash test standards for that they're going to be
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:45.320]   applying to self-driving cars there's there's a long long paper which they're explaining
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.000]   a lot of the different issues here and one of them is that from the point of view of the
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.280]   insurer in a self-driving car there is no the car itself is the driver so the person inside
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:00.080]   the car is not going to be reliable for any crash that happens so that adds extra color
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:06.640]   to the idea of a fleet operator versus the creator of that car a fleet operator wanted
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.800]   to make a repair that's maybe off the books well you've just compromised the integrity
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.520]   of the car and the car itself is now going to be responsible so at that point whom do you
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:20.040]   sue do you sue the manufacturer of the car because they still have responsibility for
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:25.400]   the safety and operation of that vehicle this this or do you get to the person who operated
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.680]   the fleet and then there's the problem of can you then say that the operator of the car
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:36.320]   is actually the software and so now the software can do an integrity check and say okay I don't
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.440]   think I don't think these cameras or these lydars are in alignment anymore therefore I'm
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.200]   going to shut down this car immediately and not allowed to operate because just like I'm
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:48.840]   not going to lend my car to a drunk driver the software is not going to allow the car to
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:54.920]   be operated by a sensor that doesn't have doesn't have any trust in so it's really interesting
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:02.000]   there's a I'll I'll also I also recommend a a youtube channel called rich rebuilds rich
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.640]   lies in rich rich rebuilds this is a guy who buys salvage title Teslas as a hobby and fixes
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:14.200]   them even though of course like Tesla themselves do not want anybody but Tesla touching these
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:19.240]   things and it's so interesting to look at all the different dimensions of this like the
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:25.320]   on is one of his first rebuilds you wound up paying about $6,000 all in on this beautifully
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:31.840]   like first generation Tesla sedan and but there was always always that fear he had to shoot
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.560]   video the first time he took it to a Tesla supercharger because he'd been charging it
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.640]   off of a home charger all this time he knew that as soon as he plugged it into a Tesla
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:45.320]   supercharger it's the car is going to call home to mama and say hi I am Tesla ID number
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:51.600]   xxxxxxx please supercharge me and then maybe the Tesla would say oh you have a salvage title
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:55.120]   I'm not only am I not going to supercharge you but I'm also going to disable your computer
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.480]   so that you'll have to have this thing towed away so it's it's there's a lot of discussions
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.120]   that still need need to be had and a lot of lawsuits that I think have to be argued before
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.480]   we're going to figure out how all this stuff is going to work yeah I'd be pretty pissed
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:12.720]   off if I pulled up to a supercharger my car got disabled that would be a big.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.440]   That user's experience.
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:20.360]   To be fair his current his current car these building was like in one of the floods in
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:26.920]   Texas and was like flooded up to like almost like the dashboard for about 15 days before
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.080]   it's pulled out.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.080]   So I don't know.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:33.200]   I know I got into a lot of trouble when I was a kid when I was 12 years old I got my
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.400]   Apple II E and of course within days my dad came in and the Apple II was opened and I
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.400]   had.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.400]   What did the warranty?
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.040]   It smelled the he could smell the soldering.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.040]   Oh good man.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.040]   Oh that was it.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:47.080]   I was updating my Apple II E so that I could play.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:51.600]   So that instead of the speaker I could play out of the stereo system and so there was you
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:55.160]   know there was a little bit of work being done to to take the speaker out and put in
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:01.480]   a phono jack and get the proper penis and and my dad was very upset that I took a $2,000
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.640]   computer and started soldering it but my grandfather was very proud of me.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.640]   I would be.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.120]   At least one of the greatest things about the about the Apple II every every like like
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:15.000]   Easter vacation like my mom would pick me up like on the last day of school and we would
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.080]   load up the car with like three or four Apple II E's and like a dozen just two dries because
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.720]   they knew that like I knew how to fix these things and rather than like send this out
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:30.280]   to a shop I would just go to the 74 L S like TTL logic chips it's usually one of these things
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:34.680]   that blew like on the daughter board on the disc to then I would do like a speed check
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:38.600]   and I would calibrate it then my friends would come over and we copy games like with
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.200]   these 12 sets of drives and was a really great vacation.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.320]   It's all it was all it was better than having a pool.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:50.680]   I'll tell you that but really but again it's about the principle of ownership the idea
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:54.160]   of how you know how you're made ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.160]   Again.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.960]   Also a lot of us to spend the entire spring break without ever having to leave the house
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.960]   and get a sunset perfect.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:04.760]   I do think that we're getting to a point where it isn't a thought of whether you know
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:07.320]   like there's this whole like whether you're going to work on your car the other question
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.240]   is whether you're going to own a car like are you or are you get to a point with self
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.040]   driving cars where when you want a car you just say you want a car and a car car.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.400]   I don't think my daughter is ever going to own a car.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.600]   I don't think my kids are going to own a car.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.120]   I think they're going to be there's a whole idea of they're going to be like oh driving
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:26.320]   you know and you know a lot of the cars by the time they get older I think a lot of them
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.600]   aren't going to have steering wheels and they're not going to have you know they're just going
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.760]   to come pick you up and take you are going to go you're going to watch a movie while
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:35.240]   you're getting there and I have to admit after I spent had a lot of meetings yesterday and
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:40.680]   I spent like four and a half hours in the car and I would last thing you want to do to
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.680]   not drive again.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:42.680]   Oh no.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.480]   Because it's not just it's not just young people there there have been a couple times
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:51.600]   in the past year where again you're probably on business and here's a situation where five
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.480]   years ago is like okay the only really the only way to do this is to is to rent a car
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:01.280]   and now I'm like I can either spend $60 to rent a car or I can spend $80 to have someone
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:06.160]   drive me there and back and I would much rather spend those couple of hours just like
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.760]   sitting in the back of a car not being panicked about I have never driven in Iowa before whereas
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.920]   the do they really care about speed limits here where's the exit I'm going to miss it
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:21.280]   and oh yeah I would much rather spend extra to not have to drive and be able to nap and
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.880]   or watch a movie or actually work. Well I and I think it's been genius and for Uber
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:31.160]   and Lyft to get to a point where we did it did change all of our perception. Yeah all
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:34.160]   of the way we look at it because taxis were not a great experience and they weren't available
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:39.640]   in a lot of places and now we don't think about say this is an urban notion because
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.880]   if you live in the country or you live in the Midwest you got to get you know it's really
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:48.000]   hard to get in case you're going up you can't hard to get a Uber to come to Sarver Pennsylvania
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.920]   yeah. But if you live in an urban or even suburban area this isn't such a far-fetched
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.800]   notion. In a vano like Sunday morning. I mean who would have thought you wouldn't have
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.880]   a map 20 years ago would have thought the car would tell you where to turn. Why don't
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:10.120]   you know after the first time we had GPS we were in truth or consequences in New Mexico
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:15.640]   it was like the first week I had the new iPhone you know with it with the GPS and I just kept
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:20.280]   on showing my wife just going. Can you believe it it's like it shows you right where you
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.840]   know this is amazing. It's incredible. I need a map I don't need to record. We know where
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:27.720]   we are. I've had an address and you know and I had had GPS units that you hooked to your
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.120]   laptop that you put on the dashboard and I had you know Tom Tom's and everything else
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:37.320]   but the idea that your phone has it it was amazing you know. Soon your phone will have
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:48.280]   Oprah. Apple Oprah Oprah Apple. Apple has made a deal to with Oprah Winfrey to unique Apple
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:53.680]   says multi your content partnership. Oprah will create original programs that embrace
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:25:00.000]   her incomparable ability to connect with audiences around the world that's all Apple said Oprah
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.200]   still has her own network own. And she's bringing Dr. Phil with her the way that I can't I
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:12.600]   Ray please don't bring Dr. Phil. But the question is how are we going to see any of this and
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:20.960]   we've talked about this before. Peter Kafka writing in a recode says there are some of
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:27.160]   the theories the thoughts that TV and media executives have about how Apple might do this.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:31.120]   Some industry observers expect Apple to make some or all the content available free for
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:37.280]   users of Apple TV's app which I'm kind of leaning I when Apple TV app first came out
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:42.160]   I thought this is ridiculous and unusable but now that Netflix is in there it is now
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.360]   once again the home screen of my Apple TV I had disabled it I use it a lot more it is
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.640]   also on iOS. Apple's told some industry executives it tends intends to strengthen that hub by
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:59.960]   making a focal point to sell subscriptions to other companies TV services as Amazon already
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   does so that's one option other people are thinking Apple will bundle its content to
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:13.880]   a very big subscription service Apple music plus and maybe even including Apple care Kafka
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.680]   says most interesting and confusing to me one TV executive who has talked to Apple says
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:25.680]   Apple intends to sell a standalone subscription to its original video shows priced below Netflix
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:33.440]   is somewhere between $8 and $11 a month right now in the US so what do you guys think?
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:39.920]   I think it's go ahead. Alex is the most Hollywood yeah the Hollywood connections I think that
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.800]   its own subscription service makes sense in the long term you know I think that it you
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.320]   know that's what Google says as well group book groupers says he he says include the original
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:53.360]   video content with an Apple music subscription you don't want another subscription you don't
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:57.360]   know how to do a lot of content so their value prop is much smaller than Netflix or HBO or
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.920]   any of those other channels that have vast library is a older shows right yeah but I you
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.080]   know my my thinking has changed in the past year or two Alex and I used to talk about this
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:10.880]   and I would say I don't understand I don't understand how Apple could effectively compete
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:16.760]   with an existing service like Netflix or a service that's that's supported by already
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:22.960]   big content content providers like Hulu but the moves that they've been making in a
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:27.840]   have made have gotten me to really really rethink a lot of this and one of it is that Apple is
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:31.360]   the classic company that they don't care they don't need to spend some they don't care about
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.680]   spending something up in the next year they care about making incremental progress until they
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.160]   have something wonderful five years from now so it doesn't matter if they don't they can't really
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.600]   even compare with Amazon Prime video for the number five years as long as they keep making these
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:50.320]   deals and slowly start acquiring wonderful content they could wind up with something really really
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.840]   valuable secondly we're in a world in which if if Apple is not talking about buying Fox's
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:01.040]   properties right now I have no idea what's with the rep to because there's a Comcast both
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:09.680]   bidding and a lot Comcast bid is now 62.5 billion I think 64 billion and and I'm really rude
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:16.240]   there's the guy because we got to get the MCU to get Wolverine with Captain America yeah great
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:22.320]   so so yeah let's all like with that turns into a comic movie but I think Apple is an interesting
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:27.040]   idea yeah it's it's it's an interesting idea in that it would immediately give them like a
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.600]   really good library and and thirdly they don't have to really compete with Netflix all they I think
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.240]   it would be a really big win for them if they simply said here is our TV app and when you launch
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:41.520]   the TV app here is all the all the original promo programming you have available to you at Apple
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.080]   and by the way here's an icon for Netflix there's an icon for Hulu here's an icon for HBO Go
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.840]   some of the stuff you might be able to buy through the service but if you've already subscribed to
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:56.080]   Netflix they're fine with that the the idea is that now they're not you're not thinking of the
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:02.080]   Apple TV as just another device that has the Netflix logo on it you're thinking of the Apple TV
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:08.560]   app that has oh wow that great that new that new the new Oprah show or that that new spin off of
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:14.480]   a firefly that they just got in 2019 2020 that again it's not the reason why you're gonna subscribe
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.400]   but it's there on the screen so you might try it out particularly if it has that Westworld
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.160]   effect where people are not enough for your friends and I'm talking about it that you want to jump
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:27.680]   in on season two so now it really does become a destination as opposed to just simply a hallway
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:33.200]   you pass through to eventually turn the door knob that says Netflix on it so yeah now I do believe
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:38.240]   that I can really see them wanting to really have a lot of original content and creating a unique
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.680]   service I still think that I mean and I think that Apple will probably just keep on making its
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.960]   own content I don't think it'll buy anybody but I mean I still think that if they were gonna buy
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:50.320]   a company Disney would make more sense you know or I guess you call it a merger but if you look at
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:55.600]   the the AR opportunities at the at the theme parks as well you know as a proof of concept as well
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:00.000]   as all the content and as well as all the back catalog as well as educational opportunities
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:06.000]   against that content I think that there'd be an enormous number of opportunities for Apple to
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.560]   to leverage you know what Disney's doing as well as the fact that Disney you know their content
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.480]   right now is printing money and doesn't seem like it's gonna I mean with this other than solo
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:21.120]   it's doing okay I don't think Apple could safely absorb Disney it's just too big yeah
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:24.240]   culturally I think that'd be the biggest problem and that's one of the reasons Apple doesn't do
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:30.000]   these big positions is 20th century Fox might be easier to swallow right again I don't think I
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.200]   think it'd be halfway in between I don't think I think Apple I think really this content play is
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.560]   going to be Apple really trying to build only ten polls so you know that that's where Amazon's
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.680]   trying to do it Amazon's trying to do that because Amazon had the problem with they made
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:48.800]   they just started firing out lots of content and most of it was really bad or mediocre and so
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.800]   you just end up like I don't think of Amazon like oh I'm gonna go watch Amazon but I do think oh I'm
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:31:00.240]   what I think is you need a destination what is genius about a Netflix is that I actually go to
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.160]   Netflix only looking for the logo like when they first put it on I was like do they really want
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:07.520]   to do that like when they just want to fade into everything else and have us watch content but now
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:11.680]   I just go through looking for Netflix series because I know that those are gonna be I actually
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.560]   think they're gonna be better than a lot of the other content that's there that's why the Apple
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:19.280]   TV app has become more and more useful adding Netflix was kind of the critical last piece of
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:25.520]   that puzzle I wonder what if Apple just sold the content like just put it in the iTunes store didn't
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:30.240]   do anything different just made it something that I mean I don't want to do that because it lacks
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.320]   the influence I think that I think that what they I think they're better more likely to package
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:39.200]   it with iMUSIC you know with you know with the Apple music and it's the idea to get a lot of
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.920]   important enough to just to make it be the locus for this like say hey this is a reason to use
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:48.960]   the TV it could be the draw if you have some or you have to have an Apple TV or an iOS device
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:53.120]   stage it to like put it in TV and then a year later put it in iTunes remember they're a hard work
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:32:01.520]   company and to some degree everything they do still is aimed at getting you to buy hardware right
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.280]   well but you could do you could do a kind of a hard part you could I think they're transitioning
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.120]   away from that they really don't want to have reliance on hardware they really do want to become
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:14.640]   a software and services company as well as being it because they're they always be a design firm
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:18.880]   first and foremost you they like to design hardware and that's where their spirit is but I really
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:24.080]   don't think I've had to sort of I myself have sort of tried to retrain myself to thinking but
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:28.080]   how will this affect their hardware business I really do think that they do see services now
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:32.160]   as a business in and of themselves and one that they're willing to put five or ten years worth
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:37.280]   of equity into the developing yeah I I agree I mean I guess that's the really the fundamental
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:43.760]   question here is is this are they acquiring all this stuff because they want to promote services
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:47.600]   or are they acquiring this stuff because they want to promote hardware I think they can do both
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:51.200]   I mean I think and I think that you could put out the raw content for instance you could have lots
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.800]   of extras and all kinds of other things that are only available in the Apple TV I mean if I was
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:33:01.840]   going to do it I would put out the Oprah content the the the core show as a as a singular thing
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.000]   that goes out everywhere that you can get everywhere and then I would have tons of extras maybe it's
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.280]   360 in the studio while they were shooting maybe it's other AR content maybe it's additional content
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:15.920]   that's only available on the platform so if you're if you're really into that you're gonna go
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:21.440]   find it and you may if the you know the platform is big enough like especially the Apple music platform
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:26.000]   at this point it's 60 million I think 60 million users yeah is big enough that just if you think
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.800]   about putting that out and promoting it to the Apple music audience you could theoretically get
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:36.640]   way more views than you would typically get on a broadcast then Oprah would get on a broadcast
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:42.080]   if they just use that platform by itself and only went out to that platform so it is and it would
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:46.080]   be something that if they did decide to do it exclusively it would be something that would be
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:51.920]   uh difficult for a company like Spotify to to match you know like they just don't have the
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:58.720]   budget to to do that like Apple can can sign deals that are you know I have no idea how much they
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:04.720]   paid Oprah but it wasn't ten dollars right you know this is it was Oprah money well they spent
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:08.720]   the you admit to spending a billion dollars so far so I wouldn't be surprised if that was in the
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:14.640]   tens or more more you know to 100 million I wouldn't be surprised if they gave her money thank god so
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:19.600]   it has to be I would think for Oprah it have to be more than money oh I think it is sure it's
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:24.160]   100 million dollars but it have to be more than money complete creative control also which she
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.560]   has her own freaking network yeah what are you gonna give her that own doesn't give her
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:34.560]   distribution you're gonna give her two things you're you're gonna give her an international
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:39.760]   audience as opposed to keeping trying to sell own to individual cable subscribers you're also
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:45.440]   going to give her freedom away from individual proprietors saying how come the own channel is
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:50.000]   not getting the views that we were expecting it to get uh they're they all these streaming
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.520]   services do pay attention to the metrics of each and every show that they buy but it's not necessarily
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.320]   a but they've they really don't they're not gonna they're not gonna buy 13 episodes and then stop
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:05.600]   airing them after number four because they didn't like the numbers on the on the first three uh it's
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.520]   really all about what does this give us that what does this give our library that it doesn't have
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.400]   already is this relationship one that we want to continue to develop and then sometimes you do have
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:19.200]   the sort of smash hit that brings new eyeballs to the service but a lot of when you hear when you
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:23.120]   read individual interviews with people who have been in these deals and they feel like it's been
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:28.160]   a successful relationship what they say is that they just give us the money we give them shows and
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:32.720]   that's really about it they don't they don't tell us about how we don't we feel as though this
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:38.640]   this this lead that this person you're considering hiring for this role is not going to bring in this
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:42.800]   demographic or this sort of ratings they're gonna give them a package of a season of shows it's
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.040]   either gonna do well enough to merit another contract for another 12 or it's not and if it
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:51.840]   doesn't you get those 12 episodes you got to write an entire storyline uh the new version of one
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.720]   day at a time which is brilliant couldn't have happened really on run regular television because
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.600]   they would not I don't think they would have had the strength to the the the security to simply say
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.880]   we're gonna write essentially a 12 episode arc with individual episodes but we're gonna tell a story
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:11.040]   that starts right here and we know what the last see last story the season is going to be
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.360]   and it's just brilliant stuff it's not an opportunity you can give other people that's what you give
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:18.240]   these groups. Cobra Kai people said the same thing they said they went with YouTube because
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.000]   YouTube guaranteed them a first full season and that was more important than money or any other
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:30.240]   consideration. Uh one day at a time brilliant oh yes is this still have the guy the super with the
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:39.120]   keys? Yes it's it's the same no no it's it's it really is like a total reboot so there is a
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:46.160]   Schneider is a Schneider but now he's like a he's a Canadian he's a Canadian immigrant and he's
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.640]   like his father owns the building and he's sort of like a hipster who's was a reprogramming
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:57.600]   drug addict but but there are but they're all Cuban Americans they're all really talking about
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.760]   really interesting topics kind of like the original one was supposed to be only they're doing it at a
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:08.160]   much much higher level by the end of see I really I really can't recommend it highly enough.
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:12.800]   And what is this on? That's the thing I think it's on Netflix.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:16.960]   Oh who knows anywhere right? It doesn't matter exactly. Cobra Kai is also brilliant.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:22.000]   So what's Cobra Kai about? Cobra Kai is the sequel to the karate kid 34 years later.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.960]   Oh wow and it's the actual actors like a sequel with the actors. It's a shame there and it it is
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.840]   so good. It is like the new idea and Hollywood it's like what can we remake? What was really
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.360]   weird is they made a YouTube video a few years ago where they said we think this whole story it
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:39.280]   was wrong. Daniel was the bully and Johnny was taking advantage of it. Oh yeah. And the entire
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.520]   series is like that like Johnny's lost everything he's down on his luck. Daniel Aruso has this
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:49.440]   super super rich car dealer karate chopping prices on billboards and it just it's it pays
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.480]   homage to everything but it skews it so beautifully at the same time. It's probably the first I mean
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:38:00.080]   I think is the one of the first successful YouTube must be because I you know that can't
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.520]   think of a lot of YouTube and YouTube premium just one international yesterday I think.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:07.920]   Yeah. Wow. This knows my YouTube red became a YouTube premium. Oh yeah it's called which is good
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:14.480]   because I no longer think that I'm watching porn. So let me throw you a curve ball.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:21.440]   According to Bloomberg Apple is near a deal to the rights for an animated movie from Cartoon
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:26.880]   Saloon which is an Ireland based Oscar nominated animation studio. The movie is at least a year
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.960]   from release because it has yet to be made but Apple has been in talks to buy distribution
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:36.960]   rights for the US and some other countries. If you want an Oscar you got to release it to
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:43.920]   theaters we know that. Why would they be trying to buy an animated feature film?
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:50.000]   Oh I mean they're going to keep on trying to buy features and I think that an animated
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.720]   feature is it's they've bought features before. I think they're going to keep on
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.800]   but I think they're going to start buying features and I think they're going to buy more
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:58.720]   features. I think there's definitely I mean I think Apple is going to want to be a
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:02.160]   contact. They're going to build a lot of content. And I think that the only reason we're not seeing
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:06.160]   them do it in music is because I'm going to guess that they probably signed contracts that said
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:11.200]   they can't do that. I think that I think that I can spotify outline that.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:18.480]   Spotify can't actually fund the making of the music. It's become clear that their
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:21.600]   contracts are. Apple made videos right? They help make the new movies. You keep them away from
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:28.880]   doing original. So this is interesting. So is there the general consensus that Apple will do
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:35.600]   this as a subscription like an Apple music plus subscription? It could be separate. I think it
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:41.520]   makes more sense to make it Apple media or Apple or Apple whatever. I think that it gets really
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.680]   complicated if you have two different subscriptions. I think nobody wants them. And the garden is
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:49.600]   really selling that. And again they have no catalog content to provide value for video
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:56.960]   subscription. I go with you get three shows. I would buy an Apple music subscription if I also
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.680]   got some show I really wanted to watch. That's enough to put it over the top because close enough
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.000]   to spotify and all the others. That would be enough to put it over the top. A good example is my
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:14.800]   family basically has iTunes, Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube TV and YouTube. My kids watch it in an
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:20.960]   enormous amount of YouTube. I watch my mother-in-law watches YouTube live and then we all watch Netflix
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:27.040]   and my wife watches a lot of Hulu and then I buy movies on iTunes. So that's pretty much almost
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:34.960]   all of our content. The only one that sticks out is HBO because of Graeme of Thrones.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:39.920]   So my subscription to HBO always starts about a week before Geme of Thrones and then I just
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:43.760]   cut it off at the end because it's cheaper than buying the shows individually. You do
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.720]   go to the cable company. You just do HBO now. HBO now. I don't do any cable. It's a lot easier.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.600]   This is why they want you to go through a quick cable company because it's such a pain in the
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:57.040]   ass to cancel anything through a cable company. Well, and not only that, it's too easy to cancel
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.520]   it on an app. Well, not only that, the moment I see that code of like register your thing with
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.800]   you or whatever, I'm like, okay, well, we're done. We're done with this relationship. You
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:10.720]   know, like I'm not interested in doing that whole register BS on me too. In fact, now you have to
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.200]   seems like you have to do it more than monthly. I get it all the time now. And again, the one
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:19.680]   that has been really what I was surprised at is how much my wife uses Hulu and it's because of
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:26.640]   all her. So you think my wife used to be my daughter, ballet dancers. And so they watch ballet?
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:28.240]   No, they watch. So you think you can dance?
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:34.880]   Thinking you dance and so in the voice, I guess is their big one. But they can watch them
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:37.760]   whenever they want. If they miss a couple of weeks, they just catch up on them. I think we probably
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.760]   should get rid of Comcast and just do everything over the top. That's what you do. I've been over
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.960]   the top for 10 years, more than 10 years. I haven't had. How do you watch the only time?
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:51.920]   How are you watching soccer? Are you watching the world? I haven't watched any soccer. You could do
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:56.880]   all this in a string. You could do it on streaming. You can do it on YouTube. You can do streaming
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:07.840]   and you can do it on YouTube. You don't care about the Oscars. No. And I could watch that on
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:13.760]   YouTube TV. It's on YouTube TV. Oh, YouTube TV. That's what solved it. The biggest thing that
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.200]   solved it for me was as soon as YouTube TV came out and it was like 25 bucks a month and now I've
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.560]   got all my live channels. And if I really want some live channels in the East Coast, I can VPN
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:28.080]   into my DC facility and switch my location. So you have a little bit of an advantage of it.
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:35.520]   No, no, but even without that, on my San Francisco, I'm on YouTube. The YouTube TV is genius. I mean,
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:41.360]   it is just easy to use. It works on my phone. It works on a web page. It works on my Apple TV.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.720]   The interface on the Apple TV is a little weird, but it works OK. And it's just been like this
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:52.240]   super easy to use platform and it solved all my needs, you know, watching this week with George
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.720]   Stepanopoulos and all that other stuff on Sunday mornings is all there. I also couldn't do my show
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:03.520]   the tear down without it because it's going to be a screen record. So anyway, but so it's, I think
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:11.040]   that that mix has been enough. But I haven't, I had regular TV. We experimented with it, I think
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:17.120]   like five years ago, four or five years ago. And my kids suddenly, I forgot, they don't see any ads.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.960]   Suddenly, they needed this cereal and they needed this game and they needed this like,
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.280]   we were like, OK, we got to get rid of the TV immediately. Like, like, because it wasn't
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.360]   because of the cost, it was because of the ads, you know, and the ads driving. I didn't realize
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:34.800]   how much my kids were driven to buy things. You know, kids are not, it's not fair to have kids
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.200]   that three, three to eight years old watching shows that tell them all the cool things they should
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:44.400]   buy. And so all of that goes away. And my kids now are so conditioned out of it, they won't watch.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.960]   They get angry at YouTube videos that show ads for more than 15 seconds.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.320]   You don't need to rag doll. This is a still need to come guess for internet. I don't,
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:55.280]   I still use Comcast or internet. I just get the internet. You can just get the internet package.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.600]   Just get the plain old internet. But that's all going to change, you know, with 5G because 5G,
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.840]   you're going to have the choice of, you know, 5G, the, the, the cell companies are going to start
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.240]   competing with the cable companies. And so you're going to have, you know, so AT&T has it both ways,
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:13.120]   but you'll have, you know, T-Mobile and Verizon will be competing. You know, they're, what they
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.360]   want is your whole 5G to be the only thing to use. You're like, you're going to get a 5G subscription,
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:20.480]   and that's going to be your phone. It's going to be your home internet. And you're not going to even
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.720]   have a Wi-Fi router. You're just going to have 5G, you know, like that, and all your, all your
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:30.240]   stuff attaches to. And that's why, that's also why they really want to, that's why they really want.
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:36.960]   When you add your cable bill to your YouTube TV bill, to your Hulu bill, to your HBO now bill,
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:41.600]   it's still less. It's still less. Oh, yeah. I mean, mine is, mine is, you know, I spend much less.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:46.320]   Not a lot. I only have, it's, you know, to it to save money, you do it to eliminate the
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:50.080]   relationship with the cable company. I just do it because it's easier. I mean, it's, but it's 50,
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.000]   60 bucks a month. And, and you know, we're more than that. I pay that for the internet.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.640]   Oh, no, my internet's more than that because I got the fast internet.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:01.440]   But that was, you know, my internet is a lot more than that. Okay. Yeah. So the,
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:04.400]   so that's, I've got, I've got, I've got any criminal costs because you had to buy the internet
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:10.000]   anyway for the speed. Yeah, I've got 200 down and 30 up or whatever. It's expensive. I mean,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.360]   it's not, I mean, not super expensive. Not as expensive as my office. I better talk to my wife
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:17.200]   before I do this. I think she's kind of tied to the cable company. But that, you know, that's,
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:21.760]   that's the dangerous thing for any industry. It's not just innovation. It's when somebody,
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:29.200]   when another company manages to break somebody's long term habit, that's dangerous as hell. Yeah.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:34.960]   As soon as it as soon as I got my, as soon as I got my head around the idea of how,
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:39.760]   how about if you don't subscribe to cable and it's just something you subscribe to because how
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.800]   else are you going to get your TV, even though you're getting Netflix, even though you're getting
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.480]   these other things, it was just, it was just felt like such a big step. And now I'm totally out of
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:55.040]   the habit of watching, watching a TV show on anybody else's schedule. The times I still have my HD
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:00.640]   home run, like a digital, digital capture, excuse me, digital tuner that's capturing to,
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:06.960]   to video files on Plex. So I still like watch like the call bear show every night. And whenever
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:12.000]   there's an interruption for commercials, I am just so annoyed because it's just not something
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.320]   I'm used to seeing. And also a lot of these commercials are just insulting and annoying.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.320]   But now there's a check box in Plex where if you check this box, it will figure out where the
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:24.880]   commercials are and actually delete them from the video file. So for the next 30 years of my life,
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:29.440]   I never have to see those commercials at all. We are, as we're being, we're being trained,
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:35.360]   not to even accept the presence of commercials in a, in a broad, in a movie or in a TV show.
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:41.120]   And my goodness is that is that I brought the fresh air, it's screws a whole bunch of industries,
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:44.320]   but they're never going to get that back once they've gotten people out of that habit.
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:47.680]   And you know, my kids, I think just think that we must have lived in the dark ages. Like my,
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:51.520]   my son, I think I tweeted about this a while ago. My son was like, we finished Lost in Space. And
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:56.320]   he was like, so when's the next season coming out? And I'm like, I was like, I was like in a year.
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:02.800]   And he's like, a year. And I said, hey, I said, hey, hey, when I used to watch these, we had to
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:09.040]   wait a week between every episode. And he was just like, Oh, man, you know, like, the craziest thing
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.480]   I ever heard. I am now really reluctant to start any season that I have to wait a week to see the
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:18.320]   next thing. I won't like, like Homeland doesn't exist until it's out. Yeah, when it's all out,
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:21.760]   you know, like, then I'll watch it. Then we can start talking. Well, those habits are changing.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:26.960]   And that's interesting. Yeah, I wonder. Yeah. I have you to pay for all this stuff. Anyway,
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:31.360]   I should probably kill the cable bill, but I just I can't do it. Just make an Ozman.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:36.800]   Really easy. You have all the TVs on at once. Just like 12 TVs. When I'm in hotels, I see like
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:39.840]   cable and I'm like, Oh, I wonder. And I start scrolling through it. And I'm like, yeah, I
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:43.680]   was nothing good on there. I don't need this at all. Like, I don't feel like I don't feel like
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.640]   the kids, right? They go to their grandparents, they watch TV and they're like, what is this?
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:49.920]   Why can't I choose what I want? Why is there what is a commercial? What? I don't understand.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.880]   Why is your TV broken? Your TV is broken. No, it's just from the 50s, son.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:58.000]   Well, and my kids are so, you know, like they sit there and they play, you know, they play Roblox
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.080]   or Minecraft or whatever while they're watching, you know, movies. The only time they don't do that
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:07.520]   is when I'm watching or they'll be watching YouTube, Dan TDM, they'll be watching him
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:14.160]   playing while they're playing. And and and it's just like this. They're kind of used to that whole
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.840]   process all the time, except for when we have a family movie night, the one time you have to
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:25.520]   actually take your iPad down. You can't. Let's get our picks of the week. I'm going to start with
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:31.120]   you, Andy, and not go mine is not a pick. It's a tip. It's a reminder of something that maybe you
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:37.440]   already knew about, but we'll forget about in a term time of crisis. It is it is the recent the
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:43.280]   startup code for resetting the max system management controller. I had to use this because
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:49.680]   for I don't know, I still don't know the reason why my trackpad on my MacBook Pro stop work the
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.440]   click on the step on the MacBook Pro stop working last night. And I don't know why it's a it's a
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.960]   has a haptic keyboard. So I could feel the when it's when it's dead dead, it just feels like tapping
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.680]   on a part of your table. So I was getting the click, but the offering system was not recognizing
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.560]   that there was a click anywhere. I could mouse I could use the keyboard to command tab all over
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:17.440]   the place. And so I was only able to and so I still didn't know exactly what was going wrong,
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:22.960]   but there's the default things that you do when you are in a problem like that, including make
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:27.520]   sure you unplug all the USB stuff because maybe you maybe you forgot that you've got a mouse plugged
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:32.160]   in and something is pushing the button that other mouse things like turning turning off Bluetooth
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:36.800]   because again, maybe you've got a magic trackpad somewhere and something fell on top of it and
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.520]   that's registering as a click somewhere. But the system management controller is one of these one
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:48.400]   of these classic, I have no idea what's wrong. But if but if I restart and hold down shift control
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:54.560]   option power, it will basically it's the part of the part of the firmware that essentially
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:50:01.120]   registers what your devices are and what they're supposed to do. And as and of course that did
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:05.760]   clear up the problem, it got fixed. Again, I don't know exactly what the problem was
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.000]   about number one, you do that because number one, maybe it will fix the problem and you don't care
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.960]   how it fixed it's long as you've got your trackpad back. And secondly, if you do take it in for service,
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:19.520]   some of the going to ask you, well, did you try resetting the system management controller?
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:23.120]   And you want to be like, Oh, yes, of course I tried the I tried doing that, but I like an
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:27.520]   idiot. Of course I reset that. And so they're probably going to probably do it anyway. And that
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.240]   saves you having to make sure that you've hidden all the bad photos off of your machine before you
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:37.120]   take it into service. It's not too hard to do. And it doesn't cost you anything.
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.160]   Resetting the p-gram. It's probably something you should have in your
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:46.240]   vocabulary of finger tricks. Yes. I've said to set the p-gram even recently.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:54.400]   Yeah, I do it all the time. I don't know why. But I do when I had a when I had my Mac Pro,
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:58.640]   the trash can Mac, and it just never worked right. I reset that SMC like daily.
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.720]   And it still never really worked right. Like a serious shortcut.
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:07.120]   Yeah. Good tip. Andy and I co Mr. Renee Richie, what do you you haven't been here
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:10.560]   in a while? I bet you have a few things you could. I do. But I'm going to do one at a time.
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:14.640]   I'm going to space myself out. So the one I want to talk about today is Apple announced this or
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:21.360]   Logitech announced this back in March. It is the new rugged keyboard and the Logitech crayon,
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:26.400]   which is like the Apple pencil. It uses Apple pencil technology, but it has a few differences.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:30.720]   The first is that it instapares. There is literally no pairing. You just touch it to the iPad and
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:35.920]   it starts working because that's what you want in a classroom environment. And it works almost
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.400]   the same as the Apple pencil. It doesn't do pressure, but it does do angle. So it does all the same
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.560]   stuff. You just can't press harder to get a bigger line, but it's also only 50 bucks. So it's way
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:50.560]   cheaper. And the nice thing about it is you can get started with it immediately, literally turn
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:57.120]   the iPad on and go. And the other thing that they put out is this Logitech keyboard that
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:01.600]   actually broke off the keyboard part. It's too far away from you to reach, but it comes with this
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:06.640]   rugged case that you can put on. And it looks like a Chromebook, but you can take it out and it
[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:12.640]   becomes an iPad again. It just became available. It is not as far as I know available to consumers
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:17.040]   yet. That's probably later in the year, but schools can start ordering them. I think they can even
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:22.720]   order them along with iPads to get the whole shebang. And Strenderty and I have been testing it out
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:28.560]   for the last couple days. Nice. Yeah, I saw your article on it. And you like drawing with it?
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:35.120]   I do. It really works with the 9.7 inch iPad, not the iPad Pro, although technology is compatible.
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:39.840]   Only the new iPad has that instant pairing technology, but it doesn't have the ProMotion
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:45.360]   refresh rate. So it's not quite as perfect as the new generation iPad Pros, but it's almost
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.600]   identical to the previous generation iPad Pro. So if you liked pencil on that, this is what
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:56.560]   you're getting for about 50 bucks. Nice. Yeah. Alex, I bet you have something fun and interesting
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:02.480]   to pick. Mine is the most amazing pick I've made. The most amazing pick in the history of Alex
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:08.720]   Lindsay. My pick today is notes. What's a little app that sits on your on your computer? You use
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:13.360]   that? I don't just use it. I use it every day all day. And I realized someone pointed at the
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:20.560]   only reason I thought I'd use it as a pick is because someone was amazed that I use notes.
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:24.800]   But the reason I use notes is because A, I can draw on things. I can make little pictures. I can
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:31.280]   draw things out. I can write ideas down. And it all gets transferred to all of my devices
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:36.640]   really fast and really easily. I have to admit that I don't find that pages and keynote and all
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:43.760]   these other things are necessarily as fluid. I just know that if I write something down really
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:47.200]   quickly in notes, I can make checklists and notes. I didn't, which I, you know, you can say,
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:51.120]   oh, I want to start a checklist. I can do a, and I do that all the time. So I sit there and I go,
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:54.960]   I have a checklist of things I need to get done today. And I'll make my, and I just know that it's
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:59.200]   everywhere. You know, all this, and I don't have to think about it. I don't have to share it. I don't
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:02.960]   have to put it on the web. I can be connected to the internet or not connected to the internet and
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:09.200]   just kind of work through it. And it is, it's just, I think it's a very overlooked app that
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:13.440]   that I realize that I use all the time and no one else, no one else uses it.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:18.720]   Like it's always like it seems like nobody else. Like everyone's always surprised when I use,
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:24.320]   when I open up notes and use it. I write whole articles on it because if I'm writing the notes,
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:28.240]   if I'm writing the outlines for my articles, I want them on all the devices while I'm thinking
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:32.080]   through them. And then I usually actually will sit there and just write the whole article and
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:36.000]   finish it off, you know, there. And then I cut and paste it. If I'm doing like a paper with pictures
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.120]   and stuff like that, I'll write the whole thing. And then I cut and paste it into pages. And then I
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:45.920]   start adding pictures and make it pretty and everything else. But it is, it's great. That's all.
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:51.360]   You know, it's funny because the built-in apps often get short shrift.
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:59.440]   They, because you have them, right? And admittedly, they're never quite as full-featured
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.720]   as a third party app because the third party apps have to add something or you wouldn't even look
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:08.400]   at them. But often they have all the functionality you need.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:12.960]   And it's just the fact that it's so seamless, it's built into everything. It's always installed.
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:18.880]   It's always there. And I can add, you know, I can type some stuff on my iPad or on my computer
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:21.760]   and then open my iPad and draw some pictures. And you know, there's just all these things.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:24.800]   You can throw like links into it. You can throw pictures into it. You can throw web pages.
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.080]   It's also, you can collect all everything you want. It's almost like a scrapbook that
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:34.320]   sings to everything. Yeah. So it's kind of my, I admit that it's my kind of easy going,
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:40.240]   never note thing, you know, that I just kind of use for all, you know, to kind of encapsulate things.
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:43.360]   Now I've told everyone, if you steal my computer, the first thing to do is look at those.
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:47.840]   Look at those. You know, Alex will delete them too fast. Yeah, exactly. That's why you need to
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:54.320]   use file vault. There you go. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.920]   Welcome back Renee. We missed you. I know you're so much so good to see you.

[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:22.000]   I don't think it is step by step as possible. I must watch that. Alex Lindsey, you follow him at
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:28.880]   his Twitter feed is probably the best place. A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:37.280]   And I will be in the 28th. I'll be at Adorama's Inspire Conference. I'll put it back on Twitter.
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:45.360]   It's next week. So I'm going to be speaking at, I said 26th on my tweet and I couldn't
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:51.600]   re-edit it. So I was typing too quickly. But it's on my Twitter thing. I'll be talking for two hours.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:57.200]   I'm starting to edit those things. You can delete them and redo it. I know. It's a bit editable.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:06.640]   I'll post it again on Twitter in a couple of places. But it's free. So you can go and chat with
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:08.880]   me. People have asked if it's live streaming. I'm still trying to find out if they're going to
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:13.600]   stream it. I'm not streaming my own talk about streaming. I'm just talking about streaming.
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:16.640]   Anyway, if you're interested, come join me in New York.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:27.520]   Tweet. And of course, Andy Inako, he is at I-H-N-A-T-K-O.com and the same spelling on the Twitter.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:33.200]   And his roller derby photos are fabulous. Actually, those come from April. You've got more recent
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:38.000]   ones, haven't you? Yep. I actually haven't put that on that version of the website yet.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:44.960]   It's on. But it's on my Flickr. You go to flicker.com/indii. Photos/indii.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:50.480]   And you're glad you stayed with Flickr, even though its future was in question with the purchase by
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:58:00.640]   Verizon and the renaming of it to Oath. Yeah. I've been putting more of the stuff that I've worked.
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:05.600]   If there's a picture that I worked hard to edit, that looks pretty. I'm putting it on Flickr instead
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:11.440]   of just Instagram because I want it to look. It's my place for pictures that look pretty. So hopefully
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.040]   they're going to be great. I'll tell you why. Smugmug is bottom. And I interviewed Don McCaskill
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:23.280]   on Friday on triangulation. And he gets it. And man, they know that Flickr is the greatest community
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:30.880]   of photo enthusiasts and beloved by its users. And they've... It's a crown jewel. And then thank
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:36.160]   God it's not in Yahoo Oath's hands anymore. It's in Smugmug's hands. Smugmug, of course, is one of
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:41.920]   the best photo sites ever. And it complements Smugmug's offerings very nicely. And Don told me they've
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:46.240]   kept the entire Flickr team intact. They're moving them into nice new offices.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:50.960]   And... Got an understanding desk. Yeah, they're going to stand out on other cages.
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:54.240]   But one of the things I said is you immediately have to replace the
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:59.520]   Flash-based slideshow on Flickr. Can you do that? Because Smugmug has an excellent HTML5 slide
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:02.320]   show. So he said, "Oh, we do? I better get on that." Point it.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:08.720]   They've been... Flickr has a unique role to play. That's separate from Instagram. It's separate from
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:13.520]   Smugmug. It's the best place to put up a photo, make it look really, really good, and also
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:17.120]   be able to write more than one sentence about it. It's really, really nice.
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:21.760]   And the community is great. The feedback, the response you get is great. I'm a huge Flickr fan.
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:27.680]   And I'm a longtime user of Smugmug. So when I heard that they bought Flickr, I couldn't have been
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:32.560]   more happy. He said all the right things. They really understand Flickr and they're going to
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:37.200]   preserve it. In fact, that's why they bought it. They bought it to save it. So I'm very, very happy
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:43.680]   about all that. He said, "Flicker started shortly after we started Smugmug. We started
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:51.200]   Smugmug in 2005, I think he said, and he knows Stewart Butterfield and the Smugmug team very well.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:56.000]   And so there was always a real connection. He said, "We've always shared technology. We understand
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:03.120]   their stack. So it's going to be an easy, easy thing." Ladies and gentlemen, you will join us.
