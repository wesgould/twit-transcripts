[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.680]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.280]   all things Macintosh.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.440]   Of course, we cover OS X. We cover the iPod, the iPhone,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.040]   and anything else Apple happens to come out with.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.800]   We're in studio me today.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.320]   I think I said that in the German syntax.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.520]   Alex Lindsey in studio, Mitt Vee is today.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.080]   Hello from asapixel call.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.680]   Guten tag.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.240]   Guten tag.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.640]   How are you today?
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.600]   Austin.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.360]   We're a little giddy.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.640]   We're a little silly today.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.360]   Andy Inako is also-- wait a minute.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.360]   That's not Andy Inako.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.400]   Andy Inako is also here.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.120]   And from the Chicago Sun Times in the Celestial
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.280]   Way to bandwidth.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.320]   And look, it's Fred Flinghofer.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.160]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.520]   Merlin Mann.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.920]   Hi.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.560]   Hi, Leo.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.920]   How are you?
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.560]   How's it going, guys?
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.520]   Triumphant return of the Mann.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.920]   The height of his hair, I think.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.360]   Look at that.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.880]   There you go.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.560]   Look at that.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.160]   I'll keep it just like that so if it gets bigger or smaller,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.040]   we'll have a standard by which--
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.520]   Yeah, we should have some kind of a distant early
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.320]   warning system just so we don't overwhelmingly
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.360]   owe us equipment.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.720]   What these days, what do you or else
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.120]   should I be giving for the Mann?
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.720]   You know, gosh, I don't know.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.760]   You look nice today.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.560]   Still my favorite thing I do in Merlin Mann.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.800]   You know, people can find-- hey, Google.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.640]   You know, Google.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.160]   Google.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   Google.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.680]   Google.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.160]   Google.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.160]   Google.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.880]   Because I'm not--
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.640]   And say Google.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.680]   They say Google our company.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.000]   And I guess that's cheaper than buying a domain name.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.480]   I think that's a good lower third for you.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.720]   Google Merlin Mann.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.200]   And you'll find everything you want for Merlin Mann.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.800]   I should-- Leo, I should have checked that.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   I really--
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.280]   You don't know what you're going to find there.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.200]   Make--
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.800]   Make--
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.360]   Save Search should be off for that search.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.920]   Merlin is back with a big announcement.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.720]   And we're going to save that for some time
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.160]   in the middle of the show, forcing you
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.840]   to listen to the entire episode.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.680]   That's how we are.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.960]   That's just how we are.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.840]   But we do have a little catching up to do for Merlin.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.760]   Because you've been gone.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   It's been a long time, Merlin.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.880]   What's the last thing you remember?
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.960]   I think it was last summer.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.760]   And I think people were playing baseball.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.240]   OK.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.960]   And I think that there was some talk about Apple
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.280]   was going to release something new that was going to literally
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.840]   change the way that we experience life.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.200]   And after that, it's all kind of a blur.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.120]   That really narrows it down, doesn't it?
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.600]   Jeez.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.760]   The back of a fan.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.080]   I don't really remember.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.840]   What else happened?
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.760]   Do you guys been following this?
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.600]   Well, I think there was this iPhone 3GS.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.920]   Well, that was-- that's recent.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.840]   You missed the whole Steve Jobs was sick.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.640]   And then he was-- and then he almost died.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.560]   And then he had a transplant.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.200]   And then he came back.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.840]   And now he's taking--
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.840]   They took his plane, Chris.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.360]   They already have.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.040]   He had liver.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.760]   And we haven't-- was he part of any of the announcements?
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.240]   Not yet.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.320]   But the rumor is strong that September will bring us
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.000]   another Mac announcement and-- or Apple announcement--
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.960]   and that Steve might be the one who does it.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.400]   Wouldn't that be an interesting comeback?
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.600]   I think he's only going to come back
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.200]   if he's going to announce something big.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.760]   Tablet.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.360]   Tablet.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.120]   The Beatles finally did come out with that yellow submarine
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.280]   iPod Merlin.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.920]   And it's all out and it's all gone.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.080]   And you missed it.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   Missed it.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080]   See.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.480]   He's like Rip Van Winkle.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.880]   He even looks like Rip Van Winkle.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.200]   Boy, he's still hanging upside down.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.600]   So he hasn't completely gotten out of it.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.080]   We're so glad to have you back, Merlin.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.360]   Merlin's going to make appearance from time to time.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.520]   You were pretty busy.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.440]   You were doing something.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.320]   I mean, you know what it is.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.840]   It's-- I don't know what it is.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.560]   You know, you get busy.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.200]   You do things.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.000]   You have to clean up around the house.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.720]   You know, the baby, you got to change the diaper, at least,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.440]   like twice.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.920]   Come on.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.160]   You were up to something else.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.760]   Oh, no, no.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.280]   I mean, it's not--
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.880]   he's a way you want me to say this thing that I was telling
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.440]   you about.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.000]   You can you?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.840]   Is it the-- is it the spot?
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.920]   Well, I'm not this-- it's kind of douchey.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.840]   But yeah, I'm writing a book.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.160]   And the book's going to come out next year.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.480]   So I've been working on that.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   And it's kind of an easy to guess pseudo secret.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.840]   Yeah, I'm writing a book about inbox zero.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.520]   And that's going to come out next year.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.320]   You're not done with it yet, though.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.840]   Done.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   You know, done is such a decisive done work.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   The moment yet has not happened when the editor takes it away
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.320]   from you.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.920]   Per se.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.240]   Has he taken away the advance yet?
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   You know, it's actually it's weird.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.440]   It's like all this crap that I do for the internet.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.360]   It's weirdly fractal and kind of fun
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.880]   and kind of keeps turning back on itself.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.080]   Because I end up having to employ a lot of the stuff
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.040]   that I'm talking about in the book to help me write the book.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.400]   You know, because that's how my life is horribly recursive.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.200]   But it's going actually-- it's going really great.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.400]   And the neat part is it is--
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.560]   I mean, I'm not going to mention the book,
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.760]   but it's going well.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.600]   And it's going to be about a lot more than email.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.680]   And if you follow any of the 43 folder stuff
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.320]   in the last year or so, it's going
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.280]   to be kind of about all the different kinds of inboxes
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.760]   in your life.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.280]   You have it.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.040]   You've slowed down, though, quite a bit on 43 folders.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.280]   Even you look nice today.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.320]   Is it now a monthly release cycle?
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.240]   Or can we even say it's--
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.040]   I don't know where people ever got the idea
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.000]   that it was a scheduled thing.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.120]   I mean, I guess by putting it on a regular basis,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.440]   we gave that impression.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.400]   Yeah, but that's OK.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.880]   I don't know.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.600]   I mean, you know what it is?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.360]   It's funny.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.040]   I guess I sometimes feel so overwhelmed
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.120]   by the amount of stuff that other people put out
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.360]   that I feel like I kind of want to keep my powder dry
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   from what everybody thinks.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.000]   Everybody's grateful for you, for that, to be honest.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.640]   Keep it-- slow it down.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.760]   Although, I think really the deal is it's such a great show
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.040]   that people want more of course.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.920]   Oh, you look nice today.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.640]   Yeah, you know what that is?
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.400]   That's a lot of work.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.200]   This is not--
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.960]   Because do you still call it a rat hole?
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.240]   Is that still a word that you use?
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.000]   Call it a rat hole.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.840]   We still have a jingle.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.960]   Are you kidding?
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.200]   And you just tell me when.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.840]   And I will play the rat hole jingle just for you.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.560]   I think you wrote it, didn't you?
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.320]   ♪ Rat hole ♪
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.120]   That's the jingle.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.840]   So I'm ready.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.880]   It's a major seventh chord.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.560]   I invented that.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.360]   I think you invented the major seventh.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.400]   Also the suspended fourth.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.320]   That's the service mark.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.560]   So there are a number of big stories.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.880]   Should we talk about the Steve Jobs?
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.200]   It's kind of hard to believe this guy still has the kahones
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.840]   when a newspaper is doing a profile of him to have his PR
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.680]   people call and say, can you pull that?
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.640]   Like they would say, oh, so we're so sorry.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.200]   Oh, what were we thinking, Mr. Jobs?
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.560]   Of course, we'll pull that right away.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.160]   Times online-- let's see.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.080]   Let me see if I can find the actual article.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.560]   Because at one point in the article,
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.360]   they called him-- they foolishly called him before he'd filed.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.280]   Right.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.440]   So it still could be incorporated into the article.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.800]   And they did.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.320]   He said it's like running a--
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.480]   this call is like raving a red flag in front of a bowl.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.960]   You know, it just got him upset.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.640]   It didn't slow anything down.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.040]   I thought I had bookmarked.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.640]   Well, sometimes there's a logical purpose for that.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.600]   You need to be able to say, well, look,
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.320]   we raised the attention of Apple to this article
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.240]   before we posted it.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.760]   If they had any complaints about the veracity,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.320]   we would have loved to have their input on it,
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.520]   but they just didn't reply before we went to press.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.640]   Well, they called out of bounds.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.160]   There's a wonderful-- there's a wonderful scene
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.480]   in which Jobs tires of an interview subject.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.760]   And he starts saying-- he says, how old were you
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.360]   when you lost your virginity?
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.000]   And then he says, how many times have you taken LSD?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.160]   And then finally-- and this is the weird--
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.360]   this word gets a little weird.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.080]   He lapses into a chant of gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.720]   gobble, and leaves.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.920]   I don't know if he was tripping or what the story was there.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.680]   You've got a lot of drugs going through there, you know.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.880]   Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.640]   You're still recovering.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.640]   There's a lot of stories.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.040]   I mean, there's so many stories bouncing around about Steve.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.880]   Nobody ever wants to have their name attached to you.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.000]   But there, if you know anybody who's been around Apple
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.640]   or Pixar or wherever, there's some mind-blowing stories
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.800]   that have-- some of them have to be urban myths.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.760]   But the takeaway from a lot of it is-- actually, you know,
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.080]   who was it?
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.280]   Somebody today, I think, was on that site
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.400]   that minimal Mac site.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.240]   Somebody-- the guy who does minimal Mac had a quote
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.120]   about how one reason he keeps things so simple
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.200]   as he kind of doesn't want to make bad decisions.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.840]   I wonder, part of it is just a certain kind
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.720]   of social awkwardness.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   As polished as the guy is, I wonder
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.000]   if there's a certain amount of wanting
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.040]   that buffer from people.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.400]   And then when they move past that buffer,
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.000]   he doesn't have the authority to say,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.800]   get the hell out of my office.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.400]   He just goes surreal.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.800]   And then things that'll scare them away.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.400]   Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.280]   Gobble.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.080]   To call jobs, this is quoted.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.840]   That's very good.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   That would be a turkey.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.360]   That's a turkey.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:20.440]   I got her like--
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:20.840]   I got it.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.360]   Two-year-old daughter.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:22.920]   Now we know.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.160]   He's doing hand shadow puppets.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.640]   This is to call it from the article.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.840]   To call jobs a control freak is to call rain wet
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   when building the first Mac engineers wanted
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.880]   to include expansion shots into slots
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.680]   into which people could slide kit
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.840]   to customize their machines.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.520]   Job resisted.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.560]   The machine was his.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.800]   It had to be closed and perfect.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.560]   And it's still added.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.840]   He's made it impossible for buyers
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.520]   ever to change batteries on his latest laptops.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.960]   So maybe you're right.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.040]   Maybe that is--
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.200]   Jobs is, in the words of the psychiatrist
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.720]   and scholar of leadership, Michael McAbee,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.040]   a productive narcissist.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.640]   Oh, Christ.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.880]   I guess we could say that we're just fortunate that he has
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.720]   good taste.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.640]   He does have good taste.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.760]   That was always his rap on Gates' it.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.520]   I think it was a group or somebody the other day
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.840]   was linking to something about this
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.120]   and talking about, first of all, there's something
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.680]   that every developer knows, which is you never
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.880]   want to add a feature that you don't want to support
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   for the rest of your life.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.960]   Everybody knows this.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.640]   You put something in there and it's in there forever.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.960]   That's a micro sauce problem.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   And I think, again, everything I know about apples,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.880]   I learned from Gruber.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.520]   But I think it was something along the lines of saying,
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.560]   hey, look, we never put anything in there
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.760]   that we don't want to have to support forever.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.360]   And I think he's very circumspect about saying--
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.880]   I say he.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.320]   It's kind of a metonymy where we end up
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.360]   making him the whole company, which I think is kind of dumb.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.040]   But I think that the company has a real ethos very much based
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.800]   on his strong personality that says,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.880]   we're going to start out by making this extremely simple
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.080]   to understand right out of the box.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.680]   It does one thing.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.440]   It doesn't do everything.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.360]   And it's going to even not do things you wish it could do.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.280]   But you're going to immediately get what this thing does.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.120]   It's going to be easy to pick up and do.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.040]   And we're never going to put stuff in there.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   I mean, again, I think about the Android.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.320]   I mean, it does everything, like to its peril in some ways.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.480]   So I don't know.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.480]   I think it's one company.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.760]   On the one hand, it is funny to turn him into Apple equal Steve
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.560]   Jobs.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.200]   But I have no hesitation in saying almost everybody at Apple
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.680]   makes their decisions based on would Steve hand me my ass
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.000]   for doing this wrong.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.040]   I don't doubt that first time.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.720]   Doesn't that paralyze him a little bit, though?
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.280]   I mean, if you're so worried about getting your ass handed
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.320]   to you that you don't dare do anything at all?
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.880]   That's definitely going to be a problem.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.360]   But the flip side of that is that have you ever
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.080]   tried to have a discussion, a rational logical and productive
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.280]   discussion with one person versus trying
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.560]   to have it with a committee of people, where you're
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.560]   talking to a group of three.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.360]   And they say, OK, that's great.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.080]   But actually, we really should bring Tom on this.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.760]   Let's sing out with Tom.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.800]   Oh, actually, Tom is actually working with Dave.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.640]   So we'll have Tom and Dave come in on this.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.200]   And by the time you finish the elephant you were trying to design
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.760]   has turned into a small moon off of Endor.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.200]   I think one of the Apple's strengths
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.640]   is that it's one guy who keeps the entire story straight
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.360]   inside his head and says, does this make sense for this company?
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.960]   Does this not make sense for this company?
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.520]   But it doesn't.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:00.960]   It doesn't.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.680]   If he's right, if he's wrong, he's wrong.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.240]   Well, and I think also, I've had some meetings
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.000]   with teams at Apple, either at Apple or at our office
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.640]   or somewhere else.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.880]   And the level of focus at Apple is--
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.640]   and I'm not talking about when Steve's in the room.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.800]   I'm talking about just all the time is intense.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.920]   There's not a lot of talk about the weather.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.400]   There's not a lot of talk about sports.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.120]   There's not a lot of talk about anything else.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.720]   There's this weird quietness that goes on.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.080]   And people wanting to talk exactly about what they came
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.760]   to talk about, have that discussion, and then move on.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.040]   And that's something that--
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.160]   there was one of the many stories of Steve
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.080]   was there was a story of--
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.720]   he walked into a meeting.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.560]   And someone asked him how his weekend was,
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.520]   and he didn't even look at the person and said,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.120]   let's just bring the intelligence of the conversation
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.560]   up a little bit.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.720]   OK.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.760]   But the thing is, is that--
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.200]   but I always think of that when I think of these guys
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:56.960]   being so focused.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.960]   No social--
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   And they're so grease with Steve.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.000]   There's just like, let's just get to the point,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.880]   let's move it forward.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.960]   And I think that that permeates the entire company.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.320]   And I think that that's a good thing
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.800]   compared to some other companies that we've worked with.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.720]   The sky is the limit, and there's a lot of different people
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.240]   doing a lot of different things.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.720]   And oftentimes, they're not very focused about how they do that.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.080]   I mean, I think Apple may be too focused at times.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.440]   But I think that that focus allows
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.960]   them to keep their eye on the ball, oftentimes more
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.600]   effectively than many other companies.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.040]   Well, to wit, Apple sells 25% of all the music in the US,
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.840]   69% of all digital music.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.480]   This is a new report from the MPD group.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.760]   Nobody really knows the actual numbers, of course.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.480]   So it's up to analysts to suss it out and get a wild ask.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.000]   Yes.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.720]   The market research firm noted that paid digital music downloads
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.760]   have continued to gross his 2007 from 20% to 35% this year.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.960]   What do you laugh at that?
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.400]   Absolutely.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   No, nothing.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   I was--
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.280]   You'll laugh at that.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.360]   I'll mention it later.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.000]   I was tapping.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.240]   I was tapping through the windows I used to do research
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.960]   while you're talking.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.760]   And so I understand what you're talking about.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.240]   And I came across--
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.440]   Something else.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.840]   Well, no, I tweet about our show right now
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.320]   that is irrelevant to the issue, but very funny.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.600]   Someone on Twitter says that Merlin looks like a celebrity
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.800]   to UI mugshot.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:17.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.000]   I just feel like a knick-knock-knock-knock.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   For those of you listening, I'm just going to have to imagine that.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.600]   You think you're better than me?
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   I think every idiot I've ever had to deal with in my entire life.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.520]   Now the worm has turned.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.560]   You look great.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.800]   Merlin, don't listen to the haters.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.720]   Don't listen to them.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   [SIGHS]
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.360]   You know, this is a really slow--
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.040]   Well, I think the one--
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.600]   I think the other thing that's connected to what you were just talking about
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.080]   is also that the iPhone has now become the most used camera on Flickr.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.600]   So that--
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.240]   Well, the new iPhone.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.920]   Because the new iPhone was that way before, wasn't it?
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.480]   The old iPhone.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.480]   I don't know if it was the--
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.760]   I don't know if--
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.960]   but according to the photosite camera finder--
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.240]   and I'm reading this actually for a moment.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.920]   Was used in terms of per capita?
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.680]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.440]   I'm using Latin wrong again.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.160]   In terms of raw tonnage of photos or in terms of per user?
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.240]   I believe it's raw tonnage of photos.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.720]   So evidently, the iPhone--
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.400]   That surprises me for a very, very simple reason that I wish were not there,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.440]   which is that it's a pain in the butt to post an iPhone photo compared to other things.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   Really?
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:39.440]   Well, compared to things that have true Flickr integration that allow something like--
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.240]   is it called Shozu?
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.000]   I remember Daniel Bryan's name.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.720]   Shozu, yeah.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.240]   Shozu.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.520]   Or Pixel Pipe.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.600]   There are programs you could put on your iPhone that will do--
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.360]   Well, no, iPhone--
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.760]   No, it doesn't.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.360]   I have to admit.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.720]   Shozu is available on the iPhone.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   Oh, I have to ask.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   It's one click, though.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.600]   You click the different photo and it's on Flickr.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.400]   Well, what happens is you take the picture and then if it's a video, Shozu says YouTube,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.720]   and if it's a picture, Shozu says Flickr, or whatever your default is, and you say, yeah?
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.000]   But I mean, the thing is natively right out of the box, most people are going to be Jesus.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.520]   Most people are going to be using email for that, and that's enulti--
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.160]   You're worse than Zha Zha Gabor.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.160]   Yes.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.120]   You're--
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.320]   Usually people with hair like yours don't worry so much about it.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   I'm like, awesome.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   What are you worried about?
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.320]   It's funny.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.960]   You need to put like a good like 60-second timer on the iPhone, which we can all say
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.440]   everything that could ever be said about Merwin's hair, and then we agree we don't
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.440]   speak about it again.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.440]   OK.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.960]   That's how we get the show moving forward.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.120]   Well, I don't think we should rush because I mean, I'll be honest.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.880]   There's hardly any news at all.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.880]   Wasn't there a number somebody throughout not long ago about, again, because I don't
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.120]   research these things, didn't somebody throw out a number about a giant leap in the number
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:50.680]   of uploads to YouTube in the weeks-- mobile uploads in the weeks after the iPhone came
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   out?
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.680]   Isn't that right?
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   Well, yeah.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.680]   I think it's totally integrated.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.520]   They make it so easy to do.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.920]   Just leave it there.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.920]   Sorry.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.920]   We're just giddy because Merwin's back.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   It's like a girl.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.920]   It's like a girl.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.520]   It's like more funny than the Merwin's back.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.120]   It's like a beautiful girl walked in the room, and we just all go, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.120]   I don't know.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.160]   It's like that orchid that only blossoms once every eight months.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.200]   And for the first month, we're like, oh, it'll come back.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   It'll come back.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   That's a stinky flower.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   It's a flower that stinks, right?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   That's 100-year planning.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   The night blooming Merlin.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.000]   But no, I think there were some numbers on that.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.240]   And the reason I think that is because-- I think why that might have been is because
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:37.040]   it's so easy to post to YouTube straight out of the camera with the iPhone.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.240]   I wish it were easier.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.760]   I wish there was a way to basically plug in either an email address or an API URL or
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.000]   something that would make it super easy.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   But that's interesting, Alex.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.240]   I think that's super interesting.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.080]   I use my phone a lot more for photos, I think, now than ever.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.600]   And I've got the 3GS, and it's mind-blowingly great.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.160]   I mean, this is the Macra stuff.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.160]   It's like crazy.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.160]   It's amazing how good that camera is.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.480]   Well, and I was surprised at how comfort-- I was on a trip up and down the one over the
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.200]   weekend with my daughter who was visiting from Pittsburgh.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.600]   And I was surprised at just how fluidly she used the iPhone constantly.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.600]   Her iPhone.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.560]   But I mean, she just shooting-- most parents would go, "God damn kidding.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.040]   Never put the phone down."
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.680]   You're going, "I'm amazed by how fluidly she used the internet."
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   The thing is, there's this--
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.680]   It was just this amazing research because I'm always curious when I gave them the phone.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.440]   When I gave them the iPhones, I was curious how much they used them.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.680]   The thing is, it is nonstop.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.320]   Like, when we're driving, if there's any dead space on the one, if there's any-- like,
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.120]   I'm working-- needing to get the gas out of-- she's down there.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.960]   She's posting new photos to Facebook.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.720]   She's posting-- she's taking new photos.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.000]   She's taking-- I showed her the auto-- you know, Pano.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.160]   And she was just shooting-- you know, Pano after Pano after Pano.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   I love auto-stitch, yeah.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   No, the auto-stitch.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.680]   And it's just-- and that's the generation that is causing these huge surges and flicker
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.200]   and causing the huge-- and now that it's $99, I think also-- I mean, now I just-- it's
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.840]   like in San Francisco, it's every third person it has.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.040]   But the $99 one's not the sexy phone.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.040]   No, it's the G.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.040]   But you know what it is?
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.040]   I got to say that.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   The copy and paste.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.040]   I mean--
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   That's huge.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.040]   I mean, I had the original one.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.240]   For reasons we actually should talk about, it's kind of funny.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.920]   I had to pick up a 3G very late in life for the 3G.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.680]   And then I picked up a 3GS after that.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.480]   And the combination, to me, I think the 3.0 was the big one.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.120]   I'm sorry, I'm still catching up on all this.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.480]   The 3.0, to me, was the really big jump.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.840]   It's the copy and paste.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   Forget about it.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.080]   Changes, everything.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.680]   The profusion of awesome book marklets that are out there now.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.400]   It changes the way-- again, Gruber had a great post about this.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.320]   But that-- I mean, that-- because this combination of things has become so much easier to use
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.960]   this like a tiny computer than it was even like three or four months ago.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   So I agree with you, Alex.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.120]   I see people-- my friends, Scott and Adam all day long.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.400]   They barely touch a computer.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.480]   They use their iPhone all day long.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.040]   And actually, did you guys talk about this yet?
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.640]   Did you talk about Adam and Lulu's sandwiches thing about the iPhone and whether it might
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.840]   be kind of capturing all the time?
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.000]   Have you guys talked about this?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Well, this was a problem.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.120]   In fact, this came out this week that the pre has been phoning home with all the data,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.640]   has been sending Palm all the GPS data every place you've been.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.680]   Is Adam saying that the iPhone's doing that too?
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   It's a totally different thing.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   But that's incredibly creepy.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.160]   Oh, that's really creepy.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.520]   I mean, look, let's face it, Sprint or AT&T knows this information.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.600]   But for the phone to send it back to the manufacturer--
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.320]   That's the same thing as people sending you all that credit card crap in the mail.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.400]   Yeah, I know my information is out there on a bunch of databases, but I don't want to
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.080]   have to be responsible for transferring it to the garbage safely.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.480]   And in that case, how was that?
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   Is that SSL?
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.480]   How's that being passed around?
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.480]   Right.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.760]   And Palm apologized but didn't deny it.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.760]   And didn't say they were stopping.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.560]   And didn't really say they were stopping.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.240]   They just say, we want to assure you that we don't use it for anything nefarious.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.240]   Oh, well, in that case--
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   Oh, go right ahead.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   Please.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.240]   Sure.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.800]   Thanks for your reassurance.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.080]   So what is Adam saying?
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.360]   He says it's recording even when you're--
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.400]   Adam, Adam, I don't notice something that a lot of people have noticed, but it was hard
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.920]   to put a finger on.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:09.520]   Have you noticed that there's kind of a weird thing that happens with the iPhone where it's
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:15.560]  -- it sounds magical and this might sound crazy, but it kind of seems like it-- you snap a photo
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.120]   and in this case of what Adam was talking about-- and this is a post on his site lonelysandwich.com--
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.440]   he took a photo of his dog and he's positive that his dog started running away like before
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.560]   he'd actually hit the button.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.320]   And he had a fantastic photo anyway.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   And there are--
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.080]   I've seen that happens all the time to me.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.640]   Try either a test that you can deal with this.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.480]   You can actually do this crazy kind of like--
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.480]   But do you think it's choosing the best shot?
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.040]   I'm wondering-- I'm wondering like Adam if they're-- and I'm not a technologist, but
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.880]   I'm wondering if there's some kind of a persistent buffer where it's always capturing stuff.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.200]   I absolutely think it's buffering.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.160]   I think that what it's actually-- my experience has been-- and this has been kind of my working
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.480]   theory that I've been playing around with is I shoot a lot of books with Snaptail or I shoot
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.600]   a lot of pieces like that and what I notice often times, not always, but it looks like
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.240]   it's waiting to see where the least amount of motion blur is.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.640]   You know where the-- when it's looking for edges and it's--
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.760]   Oh, so it might-- if the dog moved, it might say, "Well, let's go back and forth."
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.280]   And I think there's-- I think as soon as you turn the camera on, it's got a buffer going--
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.720]   this is what I believe is happening is it's got a buffer on and it's looking-- when I hit
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.560]   the button, it's going to grab a window and find the one with the least amount of blur.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.960]   And I think it might be right.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.560]   And that's actually not as hard as it sounds.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   But it is.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   If you do a high-pass filter--
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   It's like an algorithm for that that's a lot easier than just capturing.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.560]   There's a lot for that.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.720]   Actually, what happens is if you run what's called a high-pass filter, you'll get a certain
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.200]   amount of contrast ratio.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.360]   You'll see a bunch of little lines.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.360]   And so it can calculate those lines and decide how many--
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360]   It's easy.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   Where there's a lot of detail.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.360]   Right.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.560]   And when there's a lot of detail, it can say that's the image I want and it can do that.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.280]   And that's a-- that technology was in Photoshop in 1.0 or 2.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.320]   I have noticed that I'll take a picture-- I don't see the problem partly is and maybe
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.200]   Adam's being fooled by this as I was.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.800]   The click sound is not when you get the picture.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.880]   It is often after you get the picture.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.880]   The camera clicks later.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   I think it's finding a photo.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.480]   I have a slightly different theory.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.480]   Okay.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.200]   That there is something really weird in memory going on that means that you press the button
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.560]   and the iPhone is not capable and not able to find memory for that picture at that time
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.400]   and has to wait for certain pages to be written in and written out in order to get there.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.280]   Because there are two things that would happen if Apple put in this feature.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.920]   Number one, they would say, and by the way, our camera intelligently figures out when the
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.160]   best moment it takes a picture is.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.720]   It is a selling point.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.640]   Secondly, the idea of Apple intentionally putting in a feature where you press the button
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.000]   and nothing happens for an unspecified amount of time until the picture is actually taken,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.560]   that's not a feature that Apple would do.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.120]   That's a bug that they would fix if they could.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.360]   No, I'm thinking-- I'm sorry.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.360]   I was just thinking more like Tivo.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.960]   You know how like with Tivo, it's always capturing the last 30 minutes, at least on
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   my Tivo.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.960]   It's always capturing the last 30 minutes at the time.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.480]   They're a couple of digital cameras that do that too, where you put in a special sports
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.200]   mode where it's actually taking high resolution like 30 frames per second video.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.000]   And so then when you-- if you want to get a shot of your kid hitting the ball, you
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.920]   squeeze the shutter then ask you, OK, which one of these nine shots taken before and after
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.520]   you press the shutter is the one you want?
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.600]   So that seems like a cool feature.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.720]   It also seems like a really good third party opportunity.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.680]   I'm using my default camera now is not the camera application but night shot simply by
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.720]   the virtue of the fact that it intelligently waits for like-- loses the accelerometer to
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.000]   make sure that you actually see a little view meter says, OK, you're shaking, you're shaking,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.560]   you're shaking, you're not shaking quick, kick the picture.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.680]   So I get better, much better pictures that way.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.840]   I'm amazed they don't actually incorporate that into the camera app.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:42.360]   I want to-- these guys a while back, this PowerShot SD960IS based on the suggestion of
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.200]   Kibble's Sasser, a really great review of this thing.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.800]   And it's pretty mind-blowing.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.440]   It's a 12 megapixel, it's like 300, 400 bucks.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:55.080]   So 12 megapixel HD shoots like better 720 than a 5D does.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.800]   Already, I'm bringing it back to camera.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.280]   It's awesome.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.560]   But this thing is terrific.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.600]   And you know what I'm with you, Andy?
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.480]   There's something-- I think there's this emerging market for these kind of super high-end,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:13.760]   not even prosumer, but like point-and-shoots that take all of the overthinking out of photography.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.200]   And then if you want the manual mode, like in this one, it's got the equivalent of an
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.160]   modest M mode in it.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   But I'm with you.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.480]   I mean, it's so nice to have a camera where you can just put it on some kind of an easy
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.480]   setting and just go.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.480]   Now, are you doing the one?
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.280]   Does that have the slow sync flash as well?
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.640]   The night one that you're shooting?
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.040]   No, what it is, it's just a simple mode on the iPhone.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.520]   Rather, it's an application where you press the button to say, yes, I want to take a picture
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   now.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.520]   But instead of taking the picture immediately, it intelligently looks at the data coming
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.240]   off the accelerometer and waits for when it senses the least amount of movement in the
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   camera.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   Android does that.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   And the G1 has that as well.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.240]   And what's that app called?
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.240]   Night shot, I think.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.680]   It's not-- I don't use it all the time because sometimes you want a shot.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.240]   Jim Olin says, you're shaking, you're shaking, you're shaking.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.360]   And you really say, no, no, I wanted that one three minutes ago, please.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.160]   Yeah, but the thing is, the camera application is probably the single most disappointing
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.720]   built-in app on the iPhone because so many times it's like, oh, wow, this makes a great
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.160]   picture, launch the camera app.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.320]   I'm looking at that damn close shot for about 43 minutes until it opens.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.920]   Sometimes I'll tap the button, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.640]   Well, she's got her top back on now.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.160]   So really, thank you for taking the picture for four minutes.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.520]   Don't you find out that it's better than it was.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.800]   The 3GS is pretty darn-- I mean, it's definitely better than-- the simple fact that you can
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.000]   simply select a focus point, not just that, but select an exposure point.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.040]   I mean, I've done the actual-- it works.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.320]   You can't keep the camera steady enough to do an HDR image, but you can do it enough
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.200]   to say, OK, I'm going to expose for the sky, great expose for the ground, the great expose
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   for the face, great.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.320]   Then when I get those three shots in a Photoshop, I can basically take the best exposed areas
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.720]   from each and make a pretty good shot.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   There's-- I have to agree with you, Andy.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.440]   I think, first of all, well, I kind of agree.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.280]   First of all, no app will be less disappointing to me ever at this point than Mail.app.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.360]   My mail application without flagging and without more intelligent folders.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   Don't get me started.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.360]   Not very useful, yeah.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.280]   With that said, the two apps that I think continue to have a huge amount of potential
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.000]   and bad implementation because of the nature of exactly what they have to do are the camera
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   and the phone.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.480]   Yeah, I run a--
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.560]   Because they're both kind of modal, right?
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.120]   I mean, with the camera, how does the camera work?
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.080]   Well, what makes a camera a camera is you click a button and it takes a picture.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:32.120]   You don't have to announce-- you don't have to clear your throat and go-- go-- oh, computer.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.120]   Go camera.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.280]   A camera's not modal because it only does one thing.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.680]   Yeah, but you've got to go wherever you are.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   You've got to unlock it.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   And then you've got to go to the thing.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.160]   And in my case, I have a code online.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.160]   Did it for the phone.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.600]   For the phone, you've got to go.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   And if you're in the wrong tab in the phone from before, it's kind of crazy.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.480]   You've got to make all these different clicks to make a call.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.920]   Again, something the G1 I think is a little better at.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.680]   Do you use a G1 or-- you don't use a G1 all the time, do you?
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.040]   No, but I--
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.720]   Let's talk about our friends who-- there are a number of people, Gina Tapani is one,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   who are giving up their iPhone because they don't like Apple's draconian--
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.000]   She's never had an iPhone, has she?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.400]   I mean, she's always been on the G1.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.600]   Who was giving it up, though?
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.200]   There's some people are giving it up.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.000]   Mike Harrington gave his up.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.960]   Probably because he didn't get a free one.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   Who--
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   Oh, no!
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.960]   Oh, ow!
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   Ow!
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   Oh, you did-- oh, you did-- oh, no, you didn't.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.400]   Who was-- who were we talking about?
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.440]   This is a very interesting story to me.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.480]   There is actually, again, Gribber writes something great about this to sum this up.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.680]   But several developers--
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.080]   Mac, Mac, technologist types.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.680]   People like Steven Frank and people like-- I don't know if I call Andre a Mac guy, necessarily.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.720]   He's a great developer.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:45.880]   Steven Andre-- how much people have been saying, "Hey, look, enough's enough."
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.720]   As a developer, the way this stuff is going with the App Store is just-- it's untenable,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.720]   right?
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.720]   I mean, it's not like we're sitting around.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.160]   We're not like, we're oombunto guys and we got this whole mission.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.040]   But at the same time, it's like, holy crap, they're really-- they're really reaming a
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.160]   lot of good people with the App Store right now in a way that's completely chaotic and
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.840]   it's like a star chamber.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.320]   And they don't want to support that.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:08.040]   But the two funny things-- first of all, these are not people who are just Mac partisans.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.640]   These are not people who are saying, "Oh, that's it.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   I quit the Mac."
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.920]   Alex Payne, I think, is another one who's from much Twitter, is another who's talked
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.080]   about this.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.880]   But in each instance, I think every person has said, "Ah, there's just the problem is
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.120]   there's still no competition."
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   I mean--
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.160]   Well, Andre gave it up for-- was going to give up for a month.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.160]   For a month.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   His idea was, "Okay, that's it.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160]   I love my iPhone.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   This has drive me crazy."
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.160]   Sure.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.160]   For a month?
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   No problem.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   He couldn't make it a week.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.360]   By the second or third day, he was already like, "Wow, the straps for this are pretty lame
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.280]   and it's really slow.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.040]   It's hard to scroll and buys seven days like that's it."
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.800]   Well, I think that that's when we get back to Steve Jobs being a control freak.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.480]   I mean, the iPhone feels oftentimes simpler than a regular-- I mean, I don't understand--
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   It's amazing what it does.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.480]   It's amazing for our razors.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   And I barely-- I'd go in there.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.040]   I don't even know how to set the alarm.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.560]   It is amazing for all the modality that it does so much stuff, so relatively simply.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.520]   It's hard to notice it until you go-- in my experience.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.920]   So what I was telling Leo is we were out of town and I lost my iPhone.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   Lost my iPhone.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.920]   Never got it back.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   But I did have the HTC G1.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.720]   I have a friend at HTC who sent me a G1 months ago to play with.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   And I keep it around because before I had 3G on the iPhone, I'd use it for maps and stuff.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.520]   I was forced.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:28.360]   I was in a really remote place with no iPhone and I had to use the G1.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.360]   And no, no, no.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.600]   I mean, just to be really honest, there were elements of it where I was like, "Holy--"
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.880]   it was before copy and paste.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.000]   I was like, "Holy crap, there's so much about this that just leaves the iPhone in the dust."
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   No question.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.960]   I've seen that Wikipedia app where you hold it up like the Star Wars goggles and it shows
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.560]   you Wikipedia locations on the horizon.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.600]   This is the new-- what is it called?
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   Presence the new--
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.600]   I've had that on the channel for--
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.960]   Augmented reality, yeah.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   It's awesome.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.880]   And you talk about a business application that's going to blow people's mind.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.680]   Show me Wells Fargo ATMs that are near Taka Rias.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   I mean, come on.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.680]   It's going to be mind blind.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.680]   Really?
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.240]   Those two together, really?
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   Yeah, I like Mexican--
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.640]   But you can find Wells Fargo near Starbucks.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   You can find Starbucks in the Wells Fargo, which is--
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.560]   It was that place in the Embarcadero where they're on three of four corners.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.560]   Starbucks, yeah.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.640]   Anyway, it was just-- it was funny because when I heard these guys talking about it,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.960]   I felt like I knew exactly what they were saying.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.920]   The Android G1, because it's the hardware, it's mind-blowing.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.920]   It does fantastic stuff.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.000]   The apps are-- there's so much, so many great apps.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   But like Alex, I think like you always say, that fascism of Apple leads to really a stronger
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   product.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.920]   The G1 is all over the map.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   It's just--
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   Well, I think that's the issue.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.520]   And that's what-- I mean, I think that's what reduces people's experience of Windows,
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.040]   is that there are so many options.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.920]   I know that as a developer, we had to deal with-- there's 27 different machine-- major
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.760]   machine versions that we'd have to know whether our software runs on, especially if we want
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.920]   to use the hardware at all.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.760]   Or there's two or three different Macs we need to make sure it runs on an iMac and a
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.040]   Mac Pro and a MacBook.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.080]   And that's about it.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.640]   As long as we know that we know what the situation is, and it's so much simpler, and
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.120]   I think that that does produce a better experience.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.960]   Andy, have you played with the G1?
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   Much?
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:26.480]   Yeah, I'm running the G1.5, the new K&DU mobile phone.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.480]   This week.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   And I like it a lot.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:34.000]   And I also like-- I think that it fills in the gaps that are left over by the iPhone.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.640]   There are people who don't really care if there is one smooth, malifluous, continuous
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.280]   experience in one tyrant who's making sure that every single button is in line with
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.880]   the other button.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.200]   They just want to get an application that they like, and they maybe just want to slide
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.400]   out keyboard.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.400]   And I think the Android operating system is pretty much exactly where you'd want it to
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.400]   be.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.640]   One of my big disappointments with the pre is that it really tries to have it both ways.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.760]   It tries to be cute-- rather, it tries to be slick and elegant and very, very forward-looking
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.680]   without making those tough decisions saying, no, I'm afraid you can't do that because it
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.440]   would totally break your understanding of the larger phone.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:15.000]   I mean, the pre has a lot of the sophistication of an Apple operating system release and a
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.920]   lot of the stupidity of a Windows release saying, OK, there are four buttons on the base
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   of this.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.560]   Two of them are invisible with nothing indicating that there's something to press on that piece
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.560]   of plastic.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:27.040]   And the big white visible button is not the one you press in order to wake it up.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.960]   It's actually the one that's sort of hidden on the corner that's sort of snugged in with
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   the rest.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.600]   Don't worry, you'll figure it out if you don't throw it at the wall first.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.040]   Totally, and you know, it's funny.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.720]   I mean, I don't know if this is something I've said on the show before, but it's something
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.040]   that's become so crystal clear to me at this point.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.760]   You know, in all the partisanship and in all the religious wars over platforms, which
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.160]   I've always thought was a little bit silly.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.120]   I mean, even as much as I find myself getting caught up in it, a little bit of a rattle.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.980]   But I think there's, I think there really is such a fundamental difference between the
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:57.840]   three kind of major platforms that most people really miss, right?
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.360]   And I've said this a lot lately, but I mean, I think somebody, again, somebody like Gina,
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.440]   I don't know, Gina's exact feeling on this, but somebody like Gina, she's a developer
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.280]   and her whole career really relies on these small pieces loosely joined.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.080]   And this whole idea of having access down to the hardware, right?
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.960]   So when somebody says, okay, I want to own every bit of this down to the hardware, I
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.160]   want access to every part of this and I want to be able to hack everything, that's a fundamentally
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.880]   a different approach than a Mac user like me who wants a Catholic experience.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.400]   I don't, I don't, I don't want to have to like install things like make install, you
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.160]   know, from the kernel and all that kind of jazz.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   It's nice to know.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.160]   Do you know what I'm saying though?
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.840]   I think to just, I think to make it, I think to make it, it's myopic for people to say,
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.440]   oh, let's compare the iPhone to the G one because one's faster than the other.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.400]   Well, you know, if you're a vegan, it doesn't matter how good the sausage is, you're not
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   going to eat it.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.480]   You're looking at it a really, really different way.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.200]   My breakthrough when I was reviewing the G one, the first day I absolutely hated it.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.600]   And then I realized that I was being an idiot.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.760]   I was trying to use it like as if it were an iPhone when I suddenly decided, well, what
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.520]   if this is not an iPhone?
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.320]   What if it's significant that there is not an Apple logo on this?
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.840]   And as soon as I started thinking of it as a really great smartphone with a tactile interface
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.080]   that's designed to be held on its side with a little thumb wheel and with a keypad, I
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   started to really love it.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   It's bad.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.080]   And first of all, how frustrating is it at first that there's a million ways to do everything?
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   Right?
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.440]   The one thing that drives you crazy on an iPhone, there's like, it's very like, you know, there's
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.760]   one way you get communion this way from this priest.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.680]   And on the G one, it's like, oh, it's like a George Carlin bit.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.080]   It's like you can do it anyway.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.640]   There's a little nipple and then there's the button and then there's the screen and then
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.640]   there's the keyboard.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   But you know what?
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:35.480]   Once exact, Andy's nailed it, which is that once you accept this is how this device is
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.120]   put together, your mind operates completely differently.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.920]   And in the same way, Andy, that like your Kindle thing, that giant Kindle post you had
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.720]   is what kind of convinced me to get a Kindle.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.720]   But the very first thing I did when I took the Kindle out of the box was I started doing
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   this.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.720]   Yep.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.680]   But then once I did accept that the Kindle is this kind of a device, now I love it.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.840]   I use stanza.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.280]   I use, I use a caliber.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.520]   I'm using all these things now where I can move all of my books around in these different
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.520]   places.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:06.040]   It's not the question I have for you, Merlin, is that if Apple put out an iPad or a media
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:12.120]   pad or whatever that let you read books, would you use that or the Kindle?
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.120]   Two answers.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.440]   First answer, no, of course not.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.040]   Second answer, of course.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   Okay.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.520]   I mean, no, I said that about the iPhone, but I mean, I, to be honest, I use stanza and
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:26.160]   the Kindle on my iPhone a lot just because it's just so, it's just so easy.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.560]   Do you think that's going to happen?
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.560]   Do you think that's going to happen?
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   You think you're going to do that?
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.160]   I think by spring of next year, we'll have one.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.880]   Now, that's different from the crunch pad, right?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   That's a whole different thing, right?
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.840]   Yeah, completely different thing.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.800]   We are looking at two different things here too.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:46.440]   I've thought about the Kindle versus the hypothetical and only speculative Apple tablet before.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.240]   The no-shin-old tablet.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.240]   Exactly.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.440]   And when you think when the Kindle is great because it's not going to cost more than 300
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.920]   bucks if you don't want to pay more than 300.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.480]   Also it's really, really flat.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.480]   It's really, really light.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.800]   The battery lasts a whole week without you even having to think about recharging it.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:08.160]   I'm not sure how an Apple tablet would be different if I get stuck in that sort of familiar
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.160]   place where, "Hell, that's great.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.280]   I was going to go to the coffee shop, but I'm going to read, "Oh, no, I'm not because
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.760]   I forgot to recharge my tablet."
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.280]   Okay.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.600]   I guess I'll be reading on my iPhone screen again because it's the only thing that I actually
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.960]   can keep charged.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:25.400]   I mean, the Kindle DX is the bigger, I think it's a lot more significant than people are
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   letting on.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.160]   The simple fact that it does PDF natively without having to re-transmogrify it, without having
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.960]   to change it to anything else, the ease with which you can turn paper documents and even
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:42.160]   books into perfectly good, perfectly readable PDFs, it's not a trivial operation, but it's
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.920]   not a difficult operation.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.000]   And for your favorite books, those books that you find yourself rereading once every
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.600]   two months, I mean, everyone has those dozen, maybe even two dozen books that they're just
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.000]   always rereading.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.760]   It is maybe an afternoon's work to turn a 300-page book into a PDF.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.120]   See, my problem is that I only like picture books.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.920]   You could turn those into PDFs too.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.240]   Yeah, you can turn them into PDFs and look at them on my Kindle.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   They don't look the same.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.600]   I like to be able to use stuff like stanza and caliber, or are you guys familiar with
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.600]   that?
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   I mean, I'm on the desktop.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   But stanza, do you use stanza on the desktop as well?
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.280]   Yeah, that almost defeats the purpose.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.080]   If I have a Kindle, I don't tend to use it on the desktop because when I'm on the desktop,
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:25.400]   I'm not really-- when I'm using my iMac here, I'm really not in a relax and read a book
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.400]   sort of--
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.200]   I meant as a server.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.480]   To me, this is where it gets interesting.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.960]   I know Alex is such a fan of iTunes in the iTunes store.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   Same thing here.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.560]   The thing that caliber does-- caliber, by the way, hilarious.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.960]   It's such a-- it's a Python-- I've never seen a Python app look this much like a Java app.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.800]   It's mind-blowing giant icons in the Chrome.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:47.120]   But caliber is an app that basically it's almost-- the usability is not there, but it's
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.400]   a little bit like iTunes for your books.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:54.040]   So basically, if you've got-- if you've got Moby's, you've got PDB's, you've got PDF's,
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   you've got HTML.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.240]   You just throw all of this into caliber.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.360]   Caliber can run a server on your machine.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.400]   Like stanza, it can run a server that's accessible from your iPhone.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.360]   That's what I'm talking about when I say on the desktop.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.560]   So you throw all your stuff at caliber.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.560]   You throw all your stuff.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.120]   And then basically, you say, OK, I've got 9,000 books in here.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.640]   I want to go download these seven.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.600]   And you say, grab all of these books.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.840]   And it's pretty-- like I say, the usability is not there.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.280]   And what this reminds me of Leo, it takes me back to the Apple TV.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.760]   And right now, I'm totally-- I'm just on a Mac mini with Boxy and some other tools.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.160]   Yeah, that's the way to go on, unfortunately.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:32.000]   But it reminds me of how the Apple TV was such an imperfect implementation of an amazing
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.960]   idea that now is a completely different realm.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.000]   And I think what's interesting, the Kindle is opening a door that I think is going to
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.160]   be very surprising to Amazon in some ways.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.680]   Is Apple the one that's going to be able to take this ball and run, though?
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:53.080]   If you can have as MP3s, R to M for A's, if there's an equivalent format that's not
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   DRM protected.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.600]   See, they won't do that, though.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   Well, no, you can't have MP3s on your iTunes.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   Right.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   Right?
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   That's the exactly.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.840]   So there will be, obviously, a commercial protected form.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.840]   Which is for fun.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   Grab one of these-- the stance.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.240]   I know it stands-- everybody knows it stands.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.200]   To me, stands is the far superior.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.200]   And Amazon bottom.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.840]   And I think that this is the way it's going to go.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.000]   And head and shoulders in terms of usability.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.960]   It's head and shoulders above the Kindle app.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.280]   But just for fun, grab those and throw a bunch of PDFs at it that you've maybe found off
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.760]   falling off the back of a truck.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.120]   And it'll blow your mind.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.880]   You can have this different themes.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.480]   You can say, I wanted to look this way.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.160]   I want you to put these chapter markers in.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.160]   Oh, yeah, that's great.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   We talked a little bit.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.960]   It was in Andy's pick a few months ago.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:35.120]   But-- and I've been moving magazine articles into the Kindle that way.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   Very--
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   I use Instapaper.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.120]   I use Instapaper.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.120]   Instapaper is hot now because--
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.960]   Instapaper is kind of so far.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.280]   And that becomes my way of reading everything now so much with the folders.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   And there's separate book marklets for every folder.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.840]   So you can say, here's all my stuff about writing or what have.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.840]   I'm talking a lot, Leo.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.840]   I got him catching up.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.840]   I'm going to show you.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.840]   No, no, no.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   He said, come on the show.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.840]   He says, well, I don't know what I think about this stuff.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.840]   I have nothing to say.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   That's all we know.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   He says that.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.840]   That's how it all begins.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.440]   I have to say, iPhone satisfaction is very high.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.600]   You probably saw this study now.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.880]   It's only 200 people.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:12.800]   But an RBC IQ change wave survey, they didn't have enough words in the title so they had
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.360]   a few more.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.480]   Survey 200 people, 99% satisfaction rate with the iPhone.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.440]   82% of those very satisfied.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.040]   That's an improvement over the last time they pulled.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.880]   It was 73% then.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:34.000]   But what's more perhaps significant is that other phone satisfaction rates are so low.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.240]   Switches came from Motorola, Nokia, RIM, Sanio, and Palm in that order.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.960]   The iPhone clearly, despite what's happening with the didgerati, is making the end user
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.960]   very happy.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.760]   Well, I think that I went back and forth with a friend of mine.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.800]   We both had trios before the iPhone.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.920]   Our statement was generally that we hated our trio.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   We just hated every other phone.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.920]   It's just the best you could get.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.960]   We hated every other phone more.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.600]   And the iPhone, for me, is different.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.800]   I think that I actually enjoy using it.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.360]   I use it almost constantly for--
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.360]   Oh, God.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.840]   I wake up in the middle of the night and reach for my iPhone.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   It's pathetic.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.120]   I still think that the iPhone is the only phone that's ever achieved that status where it's
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.600]   the only device you really need to take with you in any situation.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.000]   Now that we're getting turned by turn navigation, now we're getting another device that I really
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.280]   don't need to take with me when I leave the house.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.840]   If we only had some sort of a mechanical keyboard solution-- I don't care if it's a
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:32.920]   pirate peg-leg solution that allowed me to actually type at more than 60 words permitted
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.200]   on it-- that would be a very, very signal change in my life.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.520]   A Bluetooth keyboard option for an either an iPad or an iPhone.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.280]   And I would only take my computer with me probably 50% of the time or less.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.440]   Google Reader, by the way, just integrated InstaPaper.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.440]   Oh, fantastic.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.440]   Isn't that great?
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.400]   You must be a Google Reader fanatic these days.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.440]   Well, now that Net Newswire, the only way you can sync Net Newswires through Google Reader
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.440]   and--
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.440]   That brought me back, too.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.440]   That brought me back, too.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.040]   Well, and there's also-- gosh, my memory's so bad.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.320]   You can Google this.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:10.120]   The key put together a Net Newswire script, an Apple script that can add things to-- I
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.560]   don't want to get this right-- can add things to InstaPaper from inside.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:18.360]   I've added one for Pinboard, the wonderful, delicious replacement site.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.040]   I love the way these pieces are all coming together.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.640]   Google Reader, the problem with Google Reader for me is it's one of those apps that's made
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.200]   for people to scan.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.360]   It's not really made for people to read.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.880]   In some ways, I have a slightly rattle.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.340]   There's slightly different reasons I use an app by-- oh my gosh, I'm going to be flaking
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:41.280]   Sean Inman called Fever, which is a mind-blowing RSS reader that you host yourself.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   Have you guys seen Fever?
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   No.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   Oh my god.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.680]   Go to feedafever.com.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:52.040]   And Sean, who does Mint, the stats app and who did one of my favorite designers, has
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   made this app-- is this too much rattle?
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.040]   Can I just--
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.600]   Now this is now-- so right now, most of us use something like Google Reader to cover
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.200]   a giant amount of information where we kind of want to read lots of stuff.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:09.120]   But don't you have those days where you're like, ah, I know there's-- it's like email.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.120]   Right?
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.120]   I know it's very much inboxer.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.360]   I know there's stuff in here that I need to see, but first I've got to get through all
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:19.200]   these people's seven tweets for today and stuff like that.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.760]   Oh, I saw Alex Payne's post about this.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.760]   Yes.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.760]   And then I realized I had to install it and it's--
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.760]   It's super easy.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.320]   You have a PHP server somewhere in MySQL.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   You're good.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.720]   It's a nice distinction.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.520]   It makes an distinction that is changing the way I think about what I read.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:40.600]   And the reason they call it fever is it creates basically heat based on what people that you
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.880]   are interested in linked to.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.440]   It's almost like a personal dig.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.960]   So there's an area that he calls kindling.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.920]   And that's all stuff that I really, really want to read.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.840]   You know, that's stuff by Gruber, that's stuff by, you know, Adam and Scott.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.480]   It's, you know, all the good stuff that I want to repeat with Alex Payne.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.480]   Not as in the Kindle reader, but as it's--
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   No, Kindle ink.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   --plighting your fire.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   That's all stuff I really want to read.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   And you have this area called sparks.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.240]   And in the same way that some people create a net newswire group called, you know, whatever
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.880]   weekly or when I get a chance or whatever, you throw anything into sparks.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.960]   You throw all those douchebag reblogging sites, all those popular tech whatever sites that
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.720]   cover everything way too much.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.720]   Throw it all in there.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.480]   You don't have to read it.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.240]   But it factors into what's called the fever.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.840]   So you go into a special area called hot.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:29.680]   And in fever, it shows you for the last n days, what did the most people in all of your feeds
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.120]   link to?
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.320]   And so you see the influence of all these doucheys sites that you--
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.200]   So it gives you the temperature based on how hot it is.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.200]   Exactly.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.560]   And so this-- why do I love this?
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.680]   Net Newswire or Google Reader is how I keep up with the stuff I really want to read.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:46.960]   But if I want to go away for five days and just find out what I missed, you know, high
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.200]   volume sites like Macworld.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   That's why I enjoy it.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.200]   I can't read every Macworld post because there's just too much stuff.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   But then I go in and once a week I say show me what the most people link to.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   That's why I gave up reading news in the first places because I wanted to use Twitter or
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.200]   friend feed to let my friends surface the good stuff instead of having to go through it all
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   myself.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   Well, this is what I was talking about with music.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   We were talking about this last week, I think.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.200]   Right.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   It was--
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.200]   So you think this-- you installed this?
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.200]   You paid for it and installed it?
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   Oh, hell yeah.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   Yeah, yeah, it's terrific.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.200]   I do use it differently.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:22.680]   But you know what's funny is in the same way I think a lot of us, we can sometimes be a
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.040]   little bit dishonest with ourselves about the person that we think we are.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:30.200]   And we say, oh gosh, I need to read all this stuff for work because it's important.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   And it's true.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   It is.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   If you walk away for a week and you come back and you see one of these sites that has like
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.320]   300 posts while you're gone, you go, what did I get out of that?
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.920]   And this makes it really easy to say, I want to understand the influence of all that and
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.800]   I want to have it there if I do want to read it.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.200]   I can do a screen grab to show what this looks like.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.520]   But I think it's terrific.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.960]   And anyway, back to the original point, I think the Google Reader integration is terrific.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.120]   And InstaPaper, wow, I can't say enough about InstaPaper.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.320]   What a great app.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.320]   OK.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.720]   You just-- I got whiplash from that.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:02.720]   But OK.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.720]   I think I followed you.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.520]   I got three hours of sleep last night.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.520]   I got three hours of sleep.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.520]   I got a little bit of pain, but I think I'm--
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.520]   I'm totally with you.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.560]   Believe it or not, Google-- when Google Reader integrated with InstaPaper, I realized
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.680]   what I did not like about every RSS news reader on the iPhone.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.160]   Because I just-- when I want-- I'm basically doing this because I know I will not have
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.160]   access to the internet.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.520]   I just want to load up my phone with stuff that I want to read on the plane or when I'm
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   without.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.040]   And usually, that's not a place where I have time to stand there for 15, 20 minutes waiting
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.520]   for it to synchronize and download because my flight's being called.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:37.360]   I love the fact that before I leave the house of the day, I obviously hit Google Reader
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.360]   just for my usual stuff.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   And instead of reading stuff, I suddenly say, great, send two.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.360]   Great.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.360]   Send two.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.400]   by the time I get to the airport, it's all done.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.540]   It's exactly what I want.
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.740]   As we go through life, I don't want new applications.
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.080]   I don't want new solutions.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.540]   I want one new button to be added to the solution
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.420]   and the application that I already know and love
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.920]   that ties everything together.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.920]   - Yeah, that instant paper delivery on my Kindle
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.200]   has been a key-imchanger for me.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.800]   - Is that automatic?
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   Can you make that automatic?
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.760]   - Yeah, as often as you want you could say every,
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.320]   as soon as there's N articles or every N days
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.100]   with this many articles, send it through the Kindle.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.220]   - Right now it's 10 cents for every,
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.680]   15, 15 cents.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.360]   So you're paying for this, in effect.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.000]   - Yeah, but it's amazing.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.080]   - But it aggregates enough, so that you do one or two a day,
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.340]   so it's only.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.440]   - I do it daily and I've actually recently changed it
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.140]   to once a week because it wasn't reading it every day.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.320]   So you get a plane. - You're basically,
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.280]   this is the dream, right?
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.760]   Build your own newspaper.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.220]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.620]   - And you know what that's interesting.
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:35.080]   - Do you see the fever do that so that you have
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.160]   only the hot stuff or using reader to do that?
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.200]   - No, what I do is my... - You share, share, share,
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.400]   or like, like, like, or whatever it is.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.440]   The way that I do this is I flip through net newswire,
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.380]   I pop stuff into Firefox, and if I like it,
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.600]   I add it, I say read later in Instapaper.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.980]   And what's great about that is it brings me back
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.220]   to reading longer pieces.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.900]   You know, I'm not just beholden to this like 175 ways
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.940]   to open Firefox, kind of, oh crap.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.420]   And so, but then I wanna do have the time
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.660]   and I do have the attention.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.900]   I know I can zoom with Instapaper on the iPhone,
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.580]   I can zoom straight into reading something,
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:07.340]   it's a little chewier and kind of more content rich.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.380]   Swear by that.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.540]   - Is that what you're doing too, Andy?
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.640]   - I'm using it in two modes.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.540]   There's a, I basically have two different folders.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.760]   One is for those really great, long,
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.480]   meaty articles on Vanity Fair and New Yorker.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.120]   And when someone says, oh, well, actually I spent 30 days
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.680]   hanging out with Monty Python and Tunisia,
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:28.280]   and I decided to just spend 12,000 words explaining it.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.000]   (laughs)
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.680]   Give me the version that puts it all in one page,
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.480]   send it to Instapaper, and I know that I'll have a book
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.640]   that I can read on my iPhone or on my Kindle.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.040]   The second one is for stuff from Google Reader,
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.240]   just little news items that I wanna either keep,
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.140]   keep track of or refer back to,
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.100]   and not want to really, really lose.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.700]   So there's the home version, there's the away version.
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.820]   The home version is, again, long stuff
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.500]   that I just wanna convert this as an ebook.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.700]   And not only that, but just keep it
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.340]   so that three months from now,
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.820]   if I wanna re-read Frank Sinatra has a cold
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.660]   for the 100 millionth time, it's there by--
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.740]   - I love that one, that's so good.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:02.260]   - God, Gaitelie, is that the second?
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.180]   - Yeah.
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:04.820]   - I almost don't wanna read anything.
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.260]   I've never read anything else he's written
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:10.140]   because if none of it is even one tenth as good as that,
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.080]   it'll just break my heart,
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.540]   'cause that's one of the most brilliant pieces
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.700]   of feature magazine right now.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.140]   - I had a giant collection, it was called
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.360]   Dancing Through the Apocalypse,
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.260]   and it was a collection of Esquire essays from the '60s.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.300]   And that's had all the great,
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.840]   had a bunch of great Tom Wolf stuff in it,
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.320]   and had that in it, and it's like,
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.540]   nobody got better, that's the best,
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.540]   that's the best magazine writing.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.920]   I mean, that and the stuff in the early New Yorker,
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.120]   that's gotta be some of the best stuff ever.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.900]   I've got a screen grab that I will share with you
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.020]   if you would like to see what a hot thing looks like.
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.340]   - Okay.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.620]   So how are we gonna share this?
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.300]   We're looking at it right now, big boy.
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.140]   - What should it be called?
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.420]   What name would you like for this?
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.780]   What's an easy short name for this?
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:45.140]   How about fever thing?
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.180]   (imitates buzzing)
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.380]   - So you install it, you need PHP,
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.340]   does it use MySQL?
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.620]   - You know, Sean's really smart about this.
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:52.860]   You actually have to run a test.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.340]   - I know, he won't let you download it,
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.180]   he won't let you pay for it
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.580]   unless you've proven it can work.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:01.580]   - I know, go to bitly, bite.ly, I'm telling you about Bitly.
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.580]   Bitly slash fever thing.
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.740]   - All right, here we go.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:08.740]   - And you can see there, Hal,
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.740]   so you'll see like there's the post,
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.500]   but Andres, the most linked to you thing
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.660]   in the last couple of weeks has been Andres thing.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.060]   And you see below there,
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:18.060]   the Gruber link to that, Alex link to that,
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.540]   people I follow, link to that.
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:20.860]   - Ah, cool.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.500]   So that gave it some heat.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.340]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.100]   Well, it's, it is just, each one is equally,
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.020]   contributes the same amount, but,
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:28.980]   but it is really interesting
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.620]   'cause you start seeing these larger patterns.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.620]   And again, this is a very kind of 43 folders, Esq idea,
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.660]   but I wanna figure out, it's an inbox or idea.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.500]   I wanna figure out the very high yield, low noise sources
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.100]   of information and we'll focus on those.
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.380]   So there's a tension, like a tension in NetNewswire.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.340]   If you ever look at the tension area in NetNews.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.900]   - And I use a couple of different services to do that
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.900]   in NetNewswire or it'll work with any reader.
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:56.100]   I also use it in reader called AIDRS,
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.460]   S-A-I-D-E-R-S-S, and then feed hub also.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.540]   And both of these will do the same thing though.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.060]   Look at what's in your subscription folders
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.260]   and then based on how many people are linking to it,
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.500]   how much activity there is,
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.860]   they'll make a new list for you,
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.940]   a new feed for you of the hot stuff from there.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:13.500]   - I'm real neophyte in this whole area.
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.540]   - Well, it's all about managing information, isn't it?
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.260]   But see, I was, this, Merlin,
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.940]   I mean, I really thought that this was what
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.700]   social media was gonna do for us.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.300]   - Well, it's a tension.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.420]   - It is, you're absolutely right, Leo,
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.100]   but it's about managing, oh God, I'm about to use a douche word.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:27.540]   I'm about to say it's about managing intelligence.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.900]   I mean, data, like they say,
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.580]   data by itself is not very useful.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:34.780]   Data in context with other data and people who tell you
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.540]   that it's valuable and why, right?
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:37.780]   That's where it gets valuable.
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.500]   And the trouble with social media in my experience,
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.060]   like I spent the last three days setting up
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:45.500]   this WordPress site and if I hear the word like thesis hook
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.860]   or WordPress hook one more time,
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:47.940]   I'm gonna lose my phone.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.420]   'Cause there's all these douchey sites
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.620]   that are just out there to be like affiliate funnels
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.140]   for selling this awesome theme.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.100]   And you start to realize how much of social media
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.340]   really is this recursive.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.380]   - It's crap, yeah.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.220]   - And it becomes hard.
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.380]   And then as people use that to build their own reputation
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:02.940]   and get more people to follow them, it gets hard.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:05.300]   - So to get better though at filtering, I don't--
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.980]   - You need a paring knife that takes you straight.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.420]   Somebody like Alex Payne, again, Alex's site,
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.820]   it's such a high value site.
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.740]   He posts very infrequently, but it's an event
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:15.580]   when he posts something, you know, like a part-time kind
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.180]   of thing. - Right, so I'm with you.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.020]   - Now what are you doing right now?
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.500]   Now what's working for you in that regard?
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.780]   The ARSS is helping.
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.900]   - ARSS, but I think Google Reader really,
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.140]   the improvements in Google Reader has made it very useful.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.820]   But I still share and I like,
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.740]   and I integrate it into my friend feed account.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.140]   I still think a lot of the conversations and engagement
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.700]   that happen on friend feed are very useful.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:37.100]   So I spend most of my time watching friend feed,
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.620]   waiting for my friends because there's that like feature
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.180]   in it, this surface good stuff.
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.180]   - Right.
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.460]   - And I have various groups that'll do that.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.620]   Friend feed still to me, you know, of course,
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.060]   it was just sold to Facebook, so I don't know
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.900]   how much longer we'll be able to use it for this.
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.060]   But it's still--
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.660]   - The comments, the comments on friend feed.
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:53.820]   - You don't like them.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:54.820]   Well you gotta block those people.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:56.300]   - Oh, they're awesome, that's a conversation.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.060]   - You gotta block those people then.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.340]   You could block people you don't wanna see
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:00.860]   and they won't see you.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:01.700]   - Yeah.
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.060]   - I agree that there's been some
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.500]   diminution of the value in friend feed,
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.580]   but I think it's still one of the best ways
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.420]   out there to do it.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.460]   It's not perfect.
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.300]   - I think you know what it is,
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.140]   I think it's a little bit like this,
[00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:14.420]   like we're talking about with a camera.
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.260]   I mean with a camera, you wanna have a camera
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.380]   that helps you focus, if you like,
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:20.580]   on the things that really make you a photographer
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.700]   and that bring what you have to the table
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.140]   without having to think about,
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.380]   if you don't wanna think about F-Stop, you don't have to.
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.260]   And I think that's what this stuff does in that same way.
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.820]   I think you derive a sense of where your high value stuff is
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.900]   and you iterate that and you're constantly kind of
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.500]   factoring and going, you know what,
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.460]   I think this guy has decided he's a pro blogger now
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.740]   and so he's kind of a dork and I don't want to follow this
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:40.580]   anymore.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.380]   And you know, we have to make the decisions every day.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.420]   I mean, how often do you unsubscribe to something in Tivo
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.900]   'cause you're just like, you know.
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:48.740]   - You have to be ruthless about that though, right?
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.540]   You have to be ruthless about unsubscribing
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.060]   and then you can be a little bit more aggressive
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:52.900]   about subscribing.
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.620]   - I think people obsess about the wrong metrics, Leo.
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.580]   I think something like you and I,
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.100]   where we're talking a second ago in Net Newswire,
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.820]   there's a wonderful feature called Attention.
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.980]   And again, applications like Slife for the Mac,
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.300]   there's these applications that will show you
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.220]   where you actually spend your life.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:07.700]   - You still use Slife?
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.940]   - I don't use it as much now, but it's a very interesting
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:11.180]   idea 'cause it actually does watch
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.980]   like what document is focal.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:15.460]   And so, you know, you say, oh, I'm not the kind of person
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.380]   that spends four hours a day on Twitter.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.980]   And you're like, "Slife says you are."
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:19.820]   - Yes, you are.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:20.660]   - Ditto here.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:21.740]   I think you're obsessed about these metrics,
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.500]   about how many pages you get instead of thinking about
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.300]   where do I derive the stuff that helps me
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.260]   make better decisions.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.460]   - Where does the attention think?
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:29.300]   'Cause that's new to me.
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.380]   I didn't know about that.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:35.020]   - Go into Net Newswire and go to Window
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:36.500]   and go to Most Attention.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.740]   - Ah, most attention to Lisa.
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:39.860]   - That will show you the things
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.260]   that you click through the most.
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.780]   So instead of going like, oh, I really like, you know,
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.340]   these stupid douchey lists, you go like, oh, wow,
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.700]   you know, it turns out for me, Gruber.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.260]   Like I click through far and away
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.860]   and Andy Beyos, waxy.org.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.580]   - So you'll link the stuff at the bottom.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.420]   - Well, two things.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.420]   It also has an area called Dinosaurs
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:56.580]   where you can say, show me feeds
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.460]   and have an update in the last 10 days.
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.300]   - Right.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.140]   - So to me, these are metrics.
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:00.980]   Why are these great metrics?
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:05.100]   They either information rich toward making good decisions,
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.300]   but B, they require absolutely no work from you,
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:08.860]   except being who you are.
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.580]   - Well, in theory, you should, I mean,
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.860]   the computer should be able to do all this.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:12.980]   It's watching what you're doing.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.300]   It should be able to figure this out.
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:15.700]   It's just imperfect.
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:16.940]   - Presenting it, and contextually.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.220]   - It's just imperfect still.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.020]   Damn, those computers.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:21.860]   - Stupid.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:23.340]   - Stupid computers.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.300]   This is why it frustrates me so much when you hear,
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.940]   that vocal minority who says,
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.620]   "Oh, well newspapers are dinosaurs.
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:31.580]   "I can't die quickly enough the way they control information."
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:33.540]   When more, as more and more of these services
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.660]   and technologies come available,
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:36.460]   it's being demonstrated that the one feature
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:38.260]   that people want the most is the feature
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.980]   that traditionally has been handed by publishers
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.380]   and editors to say, "I'm gonna stand between you
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.220]   "and the firehose.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.620]   "I'm going to select the stuff that we think is important.
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.300]   "I'm gonna throw away the things that are interesting stories,
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.300]   "but they're from big noise generators,
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.980]   "and so we're not gonna really trust that."
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.180]   And then you get to choose between who you're gonna choose,
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.740]   who you're gonna trust and who you're gonna not trust
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.500]   as a news provider.
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.500]   - Yeah, what's Corey?
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.340]   What's Corey called that?
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.780]   The reputation economy.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.700]   This idea that you increasingly have to rely
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.220]   on a relatively small number of people
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.780]   to let you know where your attention should go.
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.420]   And I totally believe that.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.700]   I think that's a giant thing.
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:12.900]   And I think, you know, it's funny actually to your point though.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:13.980]   I agree with you Andy.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:17.300]   I think as newspapers increasingly try to go down
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.780]   the sewer of this kind of like,
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:19.860]   "What do you think?
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:20.700]   " Comments."
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:21.540]   (groans)
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.380]   Kind of stuff.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:23.740]   They lose that.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.860]   NPR, wow.
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:27.220]   But you know what I agree with you.
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.660]   And what's funny is you look at somebody,
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:29.700]   what, like Jeff Jarvis?
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:32.340]   You look at somebody like my god Clay Shurkey,
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:33.180]   Dan Aboid.
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.740]   You look at these people who are really,
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.980]   they're saying there's this giant amount of stuff
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.660]   that seems really chaotic,
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:39.860]   but there's a pattern here.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.060]   And here's that.
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:42.980]   And here's why you need to care about this.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.460]   - And we're still, I think, in that.
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.940]   We're in the zone of chaos.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.700]   I mean, and this happens when I was in the print industry,
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:49.900]   you know, in the beginning of the not,
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.780]   in the early '90s, it was chaos.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.820]   It was a bunch of interns like me taking the work
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.700]   and producing a lot of bad work.
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.100]   And there was--
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.820]   - But you start to see something form out of the chaos.
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.020]   - And what we came out, you know,
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.580]   five years after that began,
[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.180]   we came out with a whole different design style,
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.540]   a lot of new ideas and new people.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:09.420]   But it did find its way back.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:10.580]   You know, and that happens everywhere.
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.020]   I mean, I think that when we look at this chaos,
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.100]   I mean, the railroads,
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.260]   there was like 6,000 different railroad companies,
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:16.500]   and then there were three.
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.340]   You know, and then they all kind of found themselves there.
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:20.380]   You know, and I think that that's,
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:21.820]   we're just in the middle of it at the moment.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:22.900]   - At some point, we have to all agree
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.220]   how wide the tracks should be.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.220]   - Right.
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:26.980]   We will one of these days.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:28.220]   Hey, I wanna take a little break,
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.540]   and we'll come back with some more news,
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.580]   and of course our picks of the week and so forth,
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.780]   but I wanna mention our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.420]   I hear you talking about setting up
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.660]   your WordPress blog, Merlin, and all the pain
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:39.820]   and suffering and thesis hooks.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.940]   Have you looked at Squarespace?
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:44.500]   - Squares, you know what, I tried Squarespace,
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:47.940]   and listen to me, I'm doing another plug.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:51.500]   It was not exactly right for precisely what I needed,
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.220]   but it was mind-blowingly cool.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.040]   - Isn't that amazing?
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.260]   - It's the app that I wanted in 2000.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.420]   It's why I went on LiveJournal.
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.980]   It's why I went on LiveJournal instead of Blogger at the time.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:01.100]   It's like, this is exactly what I want.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.380]   - They're really, I mean, you should,
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:03.860]   I'll tell you what, I'll hook you up with the guys
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.820]   and tell them what you want,
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.300]   because they're very open,
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:07.820]   they're very interested in making this
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.460]   the best possible platform, not just for blogging.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.180]   - It's not like drag and drop, like you make a site,
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.940]   it's like all kind of shakin' big pieces and parts.
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:14.780]   - You bet.
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:15.620]   - Sweet lookin' things.
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.020]   - Look a little deeper, 'cause there's, you know,
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:21.260]   the great themes, easy modification of the themes,
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:25.100]   photo galleries, they've got forums, incredible stats.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.060]   Now see, this one thing you don't really see
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:28.140]   if you just play around with it,
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:31.340]   get a site up, a sample site up and run it for a while,
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:32.780]   the stats will blow your mind.
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.460]   - And you can put as much custom in as you want.
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:35.300]   I mean, we--
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.300]   - You're customizing heavily, aren't you?
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:38.540]   - Well, my, actually, my personal little blog
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:41.700]   is no customization, and I think it's great.
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:43.060]   Some of our other stuff that we're working on,
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.060]   we've been doing heavy customization too,
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.620]   and it's great when it doesn't work.
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.460]   We send, you know, at first we were sending everything
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.220]   to the guys, 'cause we were working with them.
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.580]   We were sending requests, and they said,
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.900]   "You know, I wanna just use tech support,
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.820]   "and we use tech support."
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:55.300]   And boom, they send us back,
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.900]   this is the little snippet of code that you need.
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.740]   - Yeah.
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.580]   - You know, this is exactly what--
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.300]   - Any job of script, it wasn't because we were who we were,
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.980]   it was because this is just how tech support works there,
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.700]   and it was incredibly responsive.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.740]   - Very active of a group of community users too,
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.380]   who will help you get stuff done.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.660]   Social integration, you can move your data in and out
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.820]   very easily with their moveable type WordPress
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.140]   type header blogger tool, so you're never stuck in it,
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.380]   or, you know, it's certainly easy to set up a site
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.700]   very quickly to try it out.
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.180]   If you go to squarespace.com/macbreak,
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.820]   you could try it free for a couple of weeks
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:28.660]   without a credit card.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.340]   In fact, you'll be, you'll just say,
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.180]   "Here's what I'm gonna use is the account name
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.820]   "and password and you're done."
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.220]   And get a real good sense of it,
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.780]   and then if you decide to stick around,
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.980]   use the promo code Macbreak to save 10% off.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:44.260]   If you are in the, you know, looking at either creating
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:47.740]   a new site or designing, redesigning your existing site,
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:49.460]   just take, just do yourself a favor,
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.100]   take a look at squarespace.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.180]   It really is pretty amazing.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.780]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.580]   We do thank you so much for their support
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.300]   of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:04.260]   So, new TomTom app finally makes it to the App Store,
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.820]   $100, do you have to buy hardware to make that thing work?
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:10.220]   - No, I was gonna use that as my pick.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.260]   - Okay, so we won't say anything, but I have to say, I--
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.900]   - I'll say it now. - No, no.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.660]   It's fine. - Save it, save it.
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:21.180]   Was it you, Andy, who told me about Rodeo last week?
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.020]   - No. - Who told me about Rodeo?
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.620]   This is the, maybe it was, I know it was
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.140]   it was Randall Schwartz.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.980]   So, Rodee, I guess it's called.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.380]   So, I want you, if you do try TomTom,
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.260]   I want you to also look at the, I think, $2 or $3.
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.820]   R-O-A-D-E.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.780]   It's a turn-by-turn GPS,
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.140]   uses instead of using those expensive, you know,
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.780]   NavTech and Telenav maps.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.020]   That's why these things are expensive, by the way.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.900]   They use OpenStreetMap.org, and it's pretty amazing.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.700]   And when it has a computerized voice instead of a,
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.380]   instead of a nice lady voice.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.460]   But you-- - Recalculating.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.940]   - Yeah, recalculating, recalculating.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:03.060]   But I have to say, Rodee is something worth looking at
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.260]   before you spend the $100.
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.860]   And then you can spend $100 to get the mount,
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.500]   and additional hardware to get the mount and stuff like that.
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.140]   So, that's big news, we've been waiting for that.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.780]   - R-O-A-D-Y?
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:15.420]   - E-E.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.260]   - E-E.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.100]   - E-E.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:21.380]   I mean, for the price, worth looking at.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.700]   Okay, okay.
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.020]   So we're gonna have a face-off.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.500]   He's showing me his TomTom.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.100]   I'm gonna show you my Rodee.
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.380]   I'm gonna go home on my Rodee.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:31.620]   - And I have to admit that I think that my issue with,
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.500]   with the TomTom is I used it for so long on my trio,
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.380]   that it required the next-- - I love Tom.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.980]   I have a Tom. - And so it's like a warm--
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.220]   - It's like a little warm blanket.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.380]   - Head northwest on Kelleharmy.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.700]   It's doing the same thing that yours does.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.860]   It's using OpenStreetMap is the biggest difference.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.900]   It looks like that.
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.540]   You can get that to look like that.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.380]   - And it may be just as good.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.020]   It's just that I know TomTom is so loud.
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:53.860]   - I was direction.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:54.780]   - I have to admit that I was--
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.700]   - I'm a TomTom fan.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:56.780]   - Yeah, I mean, I just-- - For a hundred bucks,
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.580]   you can get a TomTom.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.020]   - Yeah, but I don't wanna carry--
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.500]   - It has nothing to do with money as much as it has to do
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.900]   with me not having to carry something else around in my bag.
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.100]   I have so much crap in my bag.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.660]   - Rodee will depend on also how well OpenStreetMap
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.580]   has done your area, although it's surprising
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.420]   when you're doing it.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.260]   - And I think if I traveled less,
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.140]   I'd be less sensitive to it, but I traveled a lot.
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.260]   It'd be really nice to--
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.860]   - We'll talk about, I don't wanna do your review yet.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:23.940]   - Okay, fine.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.780]   (laughing)
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.620]   - We'll go back to what I'm doing.
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.820]   - Save the review.
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.020]   It's okay.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.660]   But I like the idea of--
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.380]   - I love the idea, and I think I would definitely,
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.260]   if I wasn't sure how much I was gonna travel,
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.780]   I would definitely get the cheap version first.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.620]   - Try it first.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.660]   - Yeah, try it first.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:42.020]   - So the tablet, so anybody,
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.460]   I keep asking you this question,
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:47.940]   you keep saying all of you guys next year, not September.
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.340]   What is Apple gonna announce next month?
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.940]   It's pretty clear that Apple's gonna have a meeting.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:52.940]   - Well, typically that's a soft--
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.460]   - The iPod event?
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.220]   - Yeah, September is typically a software event,
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:59.420]   and it's typically a wrapped around music.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.420]   So we would expect this, the rumors are mostly wrapping
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.500]   around a social integration of iTunes.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.300]   - It'll tablet probably, it'll tablet.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.460]   - It'll tablet, yellow, the yellow, tab blurine.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.540]   - Well, there's that, of course.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:13.180]   And I also think that they will do new iPods
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.540]   and a cheaper iPod touch.
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:18.100]   What about the rumor that it was gonna have a camera?
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.460]   - The iPod touch, well, that would be--
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.620]   - Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:21.460]   Why not?
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.300]   - That would be big.
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:23.140]   - A touch is just--
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.420]   - Does the touch hook be yes?
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:25.260]   - No.
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.940]   - See, it just got Wi-Fi, sky hook Wi-Fi.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.300]   - A touch with GPS and a camera,
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.700]   and every lot of people that wouldn't need an iPhone.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:34.020]   - That would be, so would Apple do that?
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.100]   - I think they would.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.180]   - I think they would.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.700]   - Would it undermine AT&T?
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.540]   - I don't think they can--
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.380]   - Would they be glad to?
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:42.940]   - I think the biggest problem that AT&T has in the long run
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:45.580]   is that if Apple created another exclusive relationship
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:49.380]   with another phone device, it would destroy AT&T.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.460]   They would lose so many subscribers at one time
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.700]   if Apple moved to Verizon,
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.660]   'cause we're all just, we're all little,
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.940]   it's a Pied Piper situation where all the kids
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.460]   would just go wanderin' off with the Pied Piper.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.820]   They've done really well with this,
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.260]   but everyone hates AT&T.
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.260]   - All things digital--
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:09.140]   - All things digital says September 9th
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:10.660]   is the day for this Apple event.
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.860]   - I haven't gotten invite yet.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.180]   - I'll be in Brazil.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:14.020]   (chuckles)
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.500]   All right, I'm gonna miss it.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:16.420]   What day of the week is that?
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:17.500]   - It's Wednesday. - It's Wednesday?
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.860]   - Okay, I don't know.
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.940]   - That just popped into my head.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.460]   I'm sorry, I'm just, hold on, let's see.
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.140]   - Focus on music, mean no tablet,
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.700]   announcement of credit, all things D.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:30.900]   - Just, I mean, just pay it in fact Wednesday.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:31.740]   (laughs)
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:32.580]   - Very good.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.420]   - I'm getting the--
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:34.260]   - You're an idiot, Savant.
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:37.420]   - No, no, we have to schedule so many productions now.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.300]   I have this weird thing of calendars in my head now
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.380]   that have you, now there is, you know,
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.020]   they may talk about this Beatles,
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.780]   I mean, the Beatles are coming out in the Xbox
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:50.460]   and we, and PS3 with this rock band.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.660]   They may, this may be the Beatles announcement.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.660]   Wouldn't that be ironic, Merlin?
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.220]   (laughs)
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.060]   - It would be something.
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.940]   - I should have given up on it.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.500]   - After we gave up on it two years ago,
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.740]   they finally say, oh, and by the way, the Beatles.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:04.940]   - I was at Walgreens.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:08.140]   I was at Walgreens like I am so much at the time
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.180]   and I was looking at the ice cream section
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.660]   and thinking I'd bring some ice cream home to my family.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:16.620]   And I picked up a container of something called,
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.020]   I think was called World Peace.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.380]   - Uh-huh, yeah.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:22.540]   - And it had little John Lennon icon on it
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.580]   and apparently it's, you know,
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.860]   it's the typical kind of whatever Ben and Jerry's ice cream
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.020]   but it's got peace signs in it
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.940]   and it's, you know, something, something,
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.580]   John Lennon, charity, it's blah, blah, blah.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:32.980]   And then on the back, I flipped it over
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.340]   and I'll get the wording slightly wrong
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.980]   but if you see this, you should see this
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:36.820]   'cause you'll cry too.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.220]   And it's something like John Lennon is a trademark
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.220]   of Yoko Ono.
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:43.060]   (laughing)
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.900]   - Oh, oh, oh, that's gotta hurt.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.460]   - Now as somebody who owns service marks,
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.060]   I understand that it's the same reason
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.220]   that, you know, Ganyu has service marks on things
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.060]   so somebody can stay for me.
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.220]   But it's like, I'm not a protector, I have to do it.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.940]   Something out there was just like,
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.300]   - What really, what really, really hurts
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.140]   is that Yoko signed off on the ice cream
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.060]   but they did not, she could not sign off
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:05.780]   on iTunes store uploads for the Beatles catalog.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.660]   I think, I don't think we're gonna see Beatles tracks
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.980]   in September, chiefly because remember that
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.700]   that same month they're also releasing
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:15.380]   the entire Beatles catalog remastered on CD.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.540]   I think they wanna sell as many of those as possible
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.980]   before they allow people to get those same tracks
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.700]   in a far, far more convenient and less wasteful manner.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.420]   - They expand the standard or just remastered.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.500]   - They're super well on, now,
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.180]   here's the authority of my information.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.980]   I was watching QVC late at night
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.380]   when I saw like the demo of Rock Band
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.220]   and they actually went--
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.740]   - You're gonna buy a sword or something?
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.220]   (laughing)
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.980]   - It's not a sword, it's a reproduction katana
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.940]   made from the Han dynasty.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.540]   (laughing)
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:47.100]   A smark of only emperor's private guards
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.500]   used to be able to get a sword like this one, sir.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.060]   - Sir, a couple of convinceors.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.340]   - So yes, they tried to make the, so it has,
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.060]   (laughing)
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:58.660]   so totally remastered and now there's extra digital content.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.380]   There's like a five minute movie or documentary
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.340]   with each one.
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.540]   They also try to make a big deal
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.580]   about how you get a special little trading card
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.340]   of the cover in each one and how,
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.580]   somehow each one of these cards is with $15,
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.100]   which somehow I treat with a smart--
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.580]   - They should pay the purple chick people and the doctor.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.740]   What's the guy that's named Dr. Hubble's or whatever?
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:16.860]   Have you heard these yet?
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.860]   - What?
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.700]   - You guys know about these?
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:19.540]   - No.
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.860]   - Oh, do I, but apparently--
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:21.700]   (laughing)
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.460]   - Well, good, talk about them.
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:26.740]   - Apparently, if you were to look for these things
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:29.500]   somewhere, that people have gone out
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.020]   and personally, lovingly, carefully remastered
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.180]   all of the Beatles stuff themselves.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.740]   From all the best sources, this is happening
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.260]   for the Beach Boys, somebody basically,
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.460]   people have reconstructed smile from all different pieces.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.660]   And one of the best people I understand,
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.940]   I hear secondhand, there's a group or person
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.620]   called Purple Chick who collects the best
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.180]   of these remasters and--
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.940]   - But how would they have access to the studio tapes?
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:52.660]   - No, well, yeah, I mean, in some cases,
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.140]   they're going to original Virgin Vinyl
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.460]   that's never been opened, which is terrific.
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.980]   Anyway, if you, I hear, if you can hear these things,
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.100]   they are mind blowing.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:00.940]   - Wow.
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.980]   - And it's so funny though, because you think about stuff
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.100]   like the Neil Young, have you seen the Neil Young collection
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.300]   is a new thing?
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.020]   It's like 10 Blu-ray DVDs or something,
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.660]   and it's like, oh, stuff.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.060]   But it's funny 'cause the fans have been doing this stuff
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.380]   for years and it's done really, really well already.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.940]   They just don't have a way to put it out.
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:21.060]   - It almost feels like the grip of Yoko Ono Incorporated
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:21.900]   is slipping.
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.860]   If the fans are doing all of this stuff,
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:26.020]   how long before this stuff just kind of becomes
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:30.180]   like Kleenex, a public domain by default?
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.460]   - It's the eternal question.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:36.980]   We're back to Sony and Disney in the mid '70s.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.380]   Somehow Disney found a way to not get destroyed by the VCR.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:44.220]   Anyway, I think that rattle.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.220]   - Okay, so.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.300]   - So, what are you guys doing?
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.140]   How's your Mac?
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:48.980]   - What's up?
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.540]   - CDs, CDs, so cute.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.260]   So old.
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.660]   Did you see that there's an iPhone app,
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.500]   a bank, a USA A bank.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.100]   They're my insurance company, I like them.
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.220]   - I just got the new USA app.
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.060]   - Yeah, oh my God.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:04.900]   - It's the check.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:05.740]   - You can take a picture of a check
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.740]   and then it's in your account, like right then.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:10.460]   - Right, front and back and then you throw away the check.
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.300]   - Yeah.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.260]   - Do you have a USA bank account?
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.420]   - I just opened one because I had that.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.260]   - Just for that.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.100]   - Yeah.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:16.940]   (laughing)
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.140]   - I was like, I was like, I was like,
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:22.860]   well, you know, I grew up with USA A,
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.340]   you know, 'cause my dad was in the military.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:26.660]   - So if you have a family member who's an officer.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.500]   - Yeah, and I'm.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.340]   - To be a member.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.220]   My father-in-law was an officer in the Navy,
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.620]   so we have USA insurance.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.220]   - And my brother has been scanning checks for a long time.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.540]   Like so I was like, oh, that's pretty cool,
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.300]   but I don't really have a scanner available very often.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.220]   And I saw the picture of it.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.180]   - I can take a picture of a check.
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:43.820]   - But they don't have any branch offices,
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.340]   so this makes sense, right?
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:46.180]   - It totally.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.020]   - How are you gonna make it?
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:47.860]   - But what do you do with cash?
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:50.140]   Take a picture of the cash and promise to tear it up.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:50.980]   - I don't, I don't,
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.980]   - Who puts cash in their account?
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.660]   - Yeah, it puts cash in their account.
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.500]   - Get it, get it, get it.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.980]   - You can't get it, catch out of the account.
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.140]   - This is just some sort of a scam.
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:00.340]   Like we told them to tear up their checks and their covers.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.740]   (laughing)
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.120]   - So the check is the funny show will be the first
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.380]   to come from the entire world.
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:06.860]   (laughing)
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.500]   - So I think this is a really cool idea.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.420]   - No, I was, I was, I was done when I saw that.
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.260]   - Yeah.
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.380]   - I'm getting, I'm moving all my personal stuff to USA.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.220]   Screw this.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.780]   - I'm thinking, I was actually thinking about that.
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:18.460]   - And you can use any ATM for free,
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.140]   so you really don't, you're,
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.180]   I mean, how many, how often do you go in the bank anymore?
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.940]   - I, I, I, as little as,
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.820]   the idea that it doesn't have any branches,
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.940]   so that it's built its entire structure around that,
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.140]   to me is a huge feature because every time I go
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.660]   into Bank of America, I just wanna bang my head on the wall.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.820]   - I feel like I'm buying a Conestoga wagon or something.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:37.300]   I go in there and I go in there and all of my skills
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.740]   about how to deal with a bank have completely afterfeed.
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.380]   I go in there and I'm like,
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:47.540]   where do I, I wanna make this go into, but.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:48.700]   (laughing)
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:49.540]   - Money for you.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.380]   - Did I do that right?
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.900]   Is my number on there?
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.300]   - Money for you.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.380]   - And of course they're set up,
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.820]   of course they're set up to just go,
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:56.820]   that would, you know, that's,
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.340]   that's probably something that's pretty close
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:59.740]   to what you can do with the ATM,
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.020]   which you want me to go show you how to use the ATM.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:02.860]   (laughing)
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.220]   - They did, when they upgraded the ATM's,
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.820]   they had very nice girls out there.
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:06.660]   - They walk you off.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.500]   - They have like a host stand, they have like a host stand.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.460]   - Yeah, it was a hostess.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.660]   We could help you with that.
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.660]   - And I just say that the Bank of America branch
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:16.900]   closest to my house almost always has a small tray
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.700]   of chocolates and snacks for the customers.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:19.540]   - There you go.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.460]   - So yes, that, that tends to make me wonder,
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.180]   you know what, I'm just gonna like save all these checks
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.300]   over the course of the week and then go in and get a brownie.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.140]   - Boy, they better tell the front office about that.
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.980]   - I know, I know, some managers are gonna listen
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.100]   to this and go, yeah, so that's not exactly what we want.
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.300]   - It's kind of the reverse.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:35.540]   - Let's put the, let's put the donuts by the ATM.
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.380]   - Yeah.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.060]   - Or let's just mail them to them every time they do a deposit.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.700]   - I, my problem is I have a friend in the bank loopy
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.380]   and whenever I bounce a check or whatever,
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.620]   actually whenever Jennifer bounces a check,
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:48.020]   she goes to loopy and said, "Can you hold, hold on,
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:50.220]   hold on, you know, I bounced a check."
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.580]   - And it's nice to have a friend,
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:54.180]   but I guess that's kind of, that's very old-fashioned.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:57.020]   - Well, I just, the only, the reason main reason
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:58.220]   I didn't go in and all 'cause we,
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:00.140]   'cause we have our business accounts with a B of A
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.460]   and so Carlita could bypass all the lines by simply
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.500]   when she just takes my checks in, when she's taking
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.340]   and she does all the business.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.180]   - Right, she's still in power.
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.340]   - By the way, can we just throw these in there too?
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:10.300]   - And, and that was, I've been in the bank,
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.380]   I've been in a bank like twice in five years.
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:14.060]   - I have to say I was tempting.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.220]   - You know what's, you know, it's hilarious though.
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:16.540]   I was just thinking about this the other day,
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:18.340]   I almost put the two about this,
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.820]   but it's so funny to me that like,
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.340]   you ever order anything by Apple from Apple
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.780]   that has to come to your house?
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:28.060]   Like if you order a, I ordered a monitor cable,
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.100]   one of those like split monitor cables.
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.300]   And anything you buy from Apple in my experience
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.460]   that gets delivered to your home, it's FedEx.
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.300]   And you have to do a signature.
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.460]   - You have to do a signature.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.300]   - No matter what, it could be a USB cable.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.140]   And you've got to do it.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.380]   And then a few weeks ago I came home
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:47.460]   and on my front doorstep was a giant box of checks
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.300]   and my bank had just gone.
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.820]   - Just leave it there.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.340]   - It's like, you know, you go in there.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:52.940]   You've got to pick a password
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.460]   and it's got to be at least six characters,
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:56.660]   but it has to all be lowercase and it should be
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:57.500]   - No numbers.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.340]   - Yeah.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.500]   - And you buy a fake.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.460]   - I had a box of checks on my front porch
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.940]   in Petaluma for a week 'cause I was gone.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:05.780]   It's ridiculous.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.580]   - And I finally realized I should have some checks around.
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:10.180]   Like I don't, like I haven't actually written a check
[01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:11.820]   for four or five years.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:15.500]   And so I mean, I just order them, have B of A, you know,
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:16.340]   - I do payments.
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.660]   - I do pay, you do auto pay stuff online.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:21.300]   - I, well, Carly does the truth.
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.140]   - Carly does the truth.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:22.980]   - Carly the right stuff.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:23.820]   - That's the truth of it.
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:24.660]   - But when I have to pay someone a check,
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.540]   no, but I have automatic stuff.
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:30.980]   So the automatic, my cards and my stuff all get paid auto paying.
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.740]   - That's like saying you're a vegetarian
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.300]   because you've never killed a cow.
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.340]   (laughing)
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.380]   - I have someone who does that for me.
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.380]   - I don't read checks.
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.140]   - No, no, but I still have to,
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.140]   I have to still have to move money,
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:44.620]   but a lot of them are either direct transfers
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.500]   to other people on B of A or they are,
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.100]   or I have B of A, you know, I write the check on B of A
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:51.100]   and then it mails it out.
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:51.940]   You know, it does all that stuff.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:52.940]   And it's easier for me to manage.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:53.780]   Like if I have to write it down,
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.580]   then I'd have to pay attention to the,
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.380]   I have to, you know, I have to fill out the little,
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.740]   like pay attention to how much is my account.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.620]   - Can I, can I be Alex Lindsey for a minute?
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.260]   You know what would suck all of the air
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.860]   out of this vertical, service mark, Alex Lindsey,
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:09.140]   would be for mitt, mitt.com for a minute.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.980]   - Oh, you're taking my pick.
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:13.380]   (laughing)
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.620]   - Go ahead.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:18.140]   - Give me, I think given top notch better than anything
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.260]   I've ever used money application,
[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:22.900]   or to add bill payments, it would be over.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.940]   I mean, quicken, quicken on a Mac.
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.740]   I mean, I don't know, it's like doing dental surgery
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:27.900]   on yourself, it's a corp.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.860]   - You get free bill paying with the USAA if you,
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:31.940]   if you get a candle.
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.180]   - You know what, we're a family of draft dodgers.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:35.420]   I don't think we're eligible.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.300]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:37.340]   - No, that's not true.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.700]   - No, anybody can, anybody, yeah, your dad was an officer.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.220]   - My dad was a veteran, so I could see.
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:43.460]   - Oh yeah, and you don't have to, the bank thing,
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.060]   you don't have to be a, yeah.
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.700]   - I can scan that big pile of checks.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:47.700]   - I think anybody can turn the bank.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.940]   - No, no, I think it's, because they ask you.
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.380]   The only reason that I went through real quickly
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.460]   is 'cause I had already had USAA for insurance
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.020]   for a long time, so they're, I was already,
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:58.220]   they had like every address I had lived in in the last,
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.060]   you know.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.140]   - Oh yeah, USAA knows me.
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.940]   - The two places that know where everywhere I've lived
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.460]   in the last 10 years is USAA and Amazon.com.
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:06.580]   - Yeah.
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:09.300]   - That's what I use, Amazon.com is what I refer to
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.020]   when you have to fill out that.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.940]   If you're renting or you're filling something out,
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.660]   it says where are the last, I just wanna ask you.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:15.500]   - Check Amazon.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.820]   - I have to go to Amazon, I was like,
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.980]   where did I live for four years ago?
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.380]   And they have all of them.
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.020]   - So Quake Live is supposed to come to the Mac finally today.
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:26.220]   I think this is a big story.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.580]   Quake Live is a browser-based version of Quake
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:31.460]   that Windows users have been able to use free for some time
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.540]   and not for the Mac, and apparently,
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.140]   I'm on there right now trying to see if I can sign up.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:39.100]   'Cause I just went, I just went to go work on my iPhone.
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.300]   It works in your browser, it's browser-based
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.300]   to work on my iPhone.
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.540]   Support for Mac and Linux not yet today,
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:45.860]   but supposedly today.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.340]   There is Doom Revolution for the iPhone.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.340]   - It's kind of on rails.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.260]   So it's good.
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:52.100]   It's fun.
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:52.940]   - You play it?
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:53.780]   - Yeah, I have it on my iPhone.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:56.300]   - And it's really fun, you get to kill them so much,
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.980]   but you're kind of getting pushed around on rails.
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.580]   You're not really like wandering around like you would do.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:01.420]   - Oh, oh, it's not free.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.260]   - Yeah, yeah, it's not free.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:03.420]   - Is your framework?
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:04.460]   - It's again?
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.300]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.140]   - Yeah.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:07.540]   - It's called Doom on Rails.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.420]   It's the hottest thing right now, Web 3.0.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.700]   - I don't like to be, what does that mean for else?
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:11.540]   What does it mean?
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.860]   What does that mean?
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.540]   - Well, you can really build out a lot of stuff
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.580]   on Doom on Rails.
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:19.500]   And it's mostly dealing with an adversarial relationship
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.500]   with your users.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.700]   So instead of getting back to the use of--
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:23.540]   - You frag them.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.380]   - Yeah.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:25.940]   - Every time they screw up, you're like,
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.940]   (laughing)
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:28.780]   this is huge.
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.180]   This is a breakthrough.
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:31.020]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.180]   - I don't even want to call it Web 3.0.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.340]   It's Web 4.0.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:36.500]   Now Rails means it's not free movement, right?
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:37.340]   - You can't.
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.180]   - You can't.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:39.020]   - You have to go where they--
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.100]   - Like Dragon's Lair.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:40.940]   - Yeah.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:42.260]   - Yeah, it is a lot like Dragon's Lair
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.780]   in 3D on your phone.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.220]   But it shows you, I mean, I would love,
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:47.340]   like if Quake came out where I could play on my iPhone
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.580]   and 'cause actually the controls are pretty good,
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:50.580]   if I could play on my iPhone
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.140]   and then you could network with other people
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:56.260]   and kill them remotely, that would be good.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:57.740]   - I would like that.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.860]   - Let me, let me.
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:03.100]   - Are you okay, Leo?
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:03.940]   Do you need anything?
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:04.780]   - Are you all right?
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:05.940]   - Yes, I'm thinking.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.180]   - He went off the rails right there.
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.940]   - Let me take a break.
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.260]   We'll do our Audible pick
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:12.780]   and then since we have already telegraphed two
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.740]   out of the four picks of the week,
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:17.620]   we might as well get to those in a little bit.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:22.340]   Merlin, since you're back from the dead, so to speak,
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.940]   I thought it'd be nice to give you a chance
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:24.900]   to pick an Audible book,
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:28.180]   but let me first say Audible.com, our sponsor,
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:30.540]   is the great place where you can get
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:34.980]   Jews from 60,000 audio, you know, it's not just books,
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:38.740]   it's radio shows, podcasts, comedy performances,
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:41.300]   language lessons, any kind of audio content,
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.900]   mostly books though, and great books,
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:47.300]   they're doing a literature thing now, which is fantastic.
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:51.260]   I'm really digging, bringing back some classics in audio.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.260]   Audible built some recordings,
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:55.420]   but nine recording studios when they moved
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.460]   to their new headquarters and they have started
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.700]   instead of waiting for companies,
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.740]   and a lot of times with these older books publishing companies
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.780]   they said, "Well, I'm not gonna make an audio version of this."
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.260]   So Audible does it, and they do it so well.
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:11.460]   So now they have this Audible Modern Vanguard edition,
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:16.420]   which I just love, they're bringing back classics
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:19.540]   from Saul Bello and John Cheever and Bred Easton Ellis,
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:23.060]   Betty Friedan, John Irving, Kurt Vonnegut,
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:25.540]   some of the stuff that was just never recorded before
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.220]   is this is just, I'm really thrilled.
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:30.020]   But once again, Audible just shows their leadership
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.340]   in this audio book space.
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.740]   You can get your first Audible book absolutely free
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:37.300]   if you're not a subscriber, go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.620]   when you sign up for the gold account.
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:40.060]   That's one book a month.
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.220]   Your first one's free, even if you decide not to stick around
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:43.420]   you get to keep it.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:44.820]   Merlin, you've been reading Audible?
[01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.580]   I'm shocked.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.780]   - Reading Audible?
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.780]   Can you do that? - Listen, you've been listening.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:53.500]   - Oh, well, I bought this on the iTunes Store.
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:54.340]   I think it's an Audible.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:56.260]   You buy Audible stuff on iTunes.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.580]   - The books on iTunes are Audible, yeah.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.060]   - Okay, well in that case I totally bought this on,
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.980]   it's an Audible book.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:04.340]   - What's it called? - So it's appropriate.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:05.180]   Well.
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:06.260]   - Well.
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.260]   - Oh, I also have the hard copy.
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:09.900]   It's called "Writing Down the Bones"
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.660]   and it's by Natalie Goldberg.
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:14.700]   And it's the subtitle,
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.540]   don't let the douchey hippie subtitle throw you off.
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:17.900]   It's called "Fring the Writer Within."
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:19.500]   - Yeah, baby. - Yeah, baby.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:23.460]   - It actually comes with scented patchoulian candles.
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.020]   (laughing)
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.780]   - They have a bridged and unabridged editions on.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.580]   - Yeah, well, the one I got,
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.220]   gosh, I think it's an Audible one.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.060]   First of all, the book.
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.580]   This is a book that I think first came out in,
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:36.900]   I wanna say 1987.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.100]   And you guys familiar with this?
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:38.940]   Andy, you read this?
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:39.860]   - No, I've heard the name though.
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:40.700]   I hear it's very good.
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:41.860]   - It's a classic book.
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:42.860]   It's like if you're,
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.940]   it's one of those things where when you first realize
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.820]   that you wanna become a little bit better as a writer,
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:48.500]   that's one of the first books you either recommended
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.540]   or the first one you just gravitate to.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.540]   - It absolutely is.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:56.540]   I'm a giant acolyte and fan boy of Annie Lamont,
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:00.660]   whose book Bird by Bird has incredibly inspiring to me.
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.660]   And now when I read "Writing Down the Bones,"
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:03.820]   I reread this.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:07.020]   It's a book I read I think when I was in college.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:08.980]   It's really, it all comes back to me.
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.780]   Gosh, why you wanna write?
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:14.220]   But also at the same time, why it can be so difficult?
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:16.260]   And just the terrible disconnect
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:18.580]   between the kind of editor in your brain
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:21.180]   that won't even kind of let you get something on paper.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.620]   And so writing down the bones,
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.620]   I mean, let me cut right to the hippie chase of it
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.380]   because the crux of the book is
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:29.140]   that she's a serious practitioner of Zen meditation.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:32.460]   - No, not Zen as in keeping your house simple
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.300]   with containers and seven.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.820]   - What's wrong with that kind of Zen?
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.900]   I like that Zen.
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:41.460]   - I did, you should picture the stack of rocks.
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.620]   Yeah, you know.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.220]   - Wait, if I were Zen, if I were the word Zen,
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:48.140]   I would just be beating the crap out of me.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:49.180]   Shut up.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:51.740]   You know, simple doesn't mean Zen, like God.
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.620]   - Or paradox, oh, it's a paradox, it must be Zen.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.460]   She's a practitioner of Zen.
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:57.300]   You know what Zen is?
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.700]   Zen is a hard thing where you sit down
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.020]   and you shut up and you listen to your breath.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.140]   - Nothing any of us are any good at.
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.620]   - Do you with organizing your kitchen?
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.780]   - Yeah.
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:07.740]   - Anyway, she's a practitioner of Zen
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:10.500]   and she studied under this guy named,
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.140]   I think his name is Categiri Roshi,
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:13.540]   that you'll hear that name a lot.
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.660]   And the crux of the book is she says that,
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:19.540]   she says that writing is a practice, like meditation.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.620]   It's something that you sit down
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:22.820]   and you do with a certain kind of write intention
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.300]   if you like or write.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:25.140]   It's seen very much like the people tend.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.900]   - That makes sense, that makes sense.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.220]   - Oh, it's, and you know what, here's the thing.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.340]   And this is where it's a very muscular idea
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:31.820]   and not the kind of wavy, gravy thing
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:34.460]   that all this kind of BS, pseudo-budism stuff,
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.940]   you know, tends to point to.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.220]   She's saying that really, this is about,
[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:39.580]   this is about saying that I'm gonna sit down
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.780]   and work on this on a regular basis
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:46.780]   without an overarching feeling of how I think
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:48.020]   or know it's going to turn out.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.460]   So I don't know if this is gonna go well,
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.780]   I don't know what I'm gonna write about
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:53.100]   and I'm gonna kind of give myself permission
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.460]   to sit down and make this thing.
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:57.380]   Couple things.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.220]   First of all, this idea of what she calls
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.300]   the rules of writing practice.
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.500]   If you've ever struggled to get started writing something,
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:06.300]   this is along the lines of what Annie Lamont has called,
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.140]   I don't know if I can curse on here,
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:07.980]   I probably can't.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.340]   The S-E.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.180]   - S-E.
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.180]   - S-E.
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:12.020]   - S-E, the.
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.340]   (beeping)
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:14.180]   - Okay.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.740]   And so very, very similar idea here,
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:16.980]   I was saying I'm gonna sit down,
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.300]   my hand has to stay in motion for 10 minutes.
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:22.260]   I am not allowed to cross anything out.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:23.300]   I have to keep moving forward,
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:24.820]   I'm not allowed to go back and edit.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.380]   I had to be very specific,
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:27.460]   I'd be very concrete,
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:28.860]   I have to go for the jugular,
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.220]   and I have to go past what she calls
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:32.700]   discursive thoughts down to first thoughts.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.700]   The thing you really wanted to say
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.460]   that you didn't know you wanted to say.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.780]   And anybody who sits down and goes,
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:39.220]   "This is a story about blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.660]   And you hate even seeing that on a page.
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:42.820]   This is the book that you need.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.740]   Because she shows you how if you sit down every day
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:45.860]   and work on this stuff,
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:46.660]   it makes a difference.
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.380]   As I like to say, it's a small muscle
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.300]   that you learn how to exercise.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:53.820]   And the funny thing is, I call this the lizard brain,
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:54.860]   but there's this voice in your head
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:57.340]   that's always giving you this terrible advice
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:58.900]   about how to avoid short-term pain
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.780]   instead of long-term gains.
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:06.420]   And it's just a terrific book for treating your writing
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:09.140]   with just the right amount of seriousness and focus
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.620]   and enabling yourself to get something down
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.820]   that's a very authentic idea
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:14.980]   before the editor in your head
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.060]   tells you what a piece of junk it is.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:17.900]   Writing down the bones
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.580]   and the addition that I have is terrific.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:22.380]   The audiobook I've got, she reads the book
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.460]   and then afterward after each chapter,
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:27.260]   she has a wonderful little kind of update
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:28.220]   where she talks a little bit about,
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:30.980]   "Gosh, here's where I was at when I was writing that
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:34.020]   "and now I really think this or no, I really say that."
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.340]   And I just think it's a terrific,
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:36.500]   there's so many books about writing
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.500]   that are just full of like magical thinking.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.060]   This is like all the books about creativity that I enjoy.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:42.620]   This is one that says that creativity
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:45.540]   is really about putting your button of chair and doing it.
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:46.900]   And so I love it.
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.980]   Natalie Goldberg writing down the bones, wonderful book.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:51.780]   - Our Audible Pick of the Week, you get it free.
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.940]   Go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:58.780]   and I'm adding it to my cart right now.
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:00.140]   I never read this book
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:01.460]   and I have no desire to be a writer
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:04.580]   because I know how hard it is to move that small muscle.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.180]   - It's a big muscle.
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:08.260]   - I've been trying to move that muscle for a while.
[01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:09.100]   - I don't know how Andy does it.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.220]   Andy, Andy, how do you do it?
[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:12.660]   How do you keep making so many words?
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:13.980]   I have no idea how you do it so much.
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:15.380]   - It's hard work, isn't it?
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:17.180]   I mean, one of the reasons why that's such a great book
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:19.300]   is because it's the simplest and most common
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.620]   and the most useful piece of advice you need.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:24.220]   You just gotta keep moving that cursor to the right.
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.540]   That's really all there is to it.
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.660]   You have to disavow yourself of the idea
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:30.380]   that the first version of anything you write
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:32.020]   is gonna be any good whatsoever.
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:33.660]   You realize that that's the hard part.
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:35.220]   Getting from start to finish
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.140]   is the hardest part of writing anything
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:38.740]   and then the fun part begins.
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.100]   You get to fix what you wrote
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.580]   and that's maybe 10% of it.
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:44.780]   But for me, it's like, I'm in the middle
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:48.380]   of updating my iPhone book, third edition,
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:51.380]   hopefully it'll be coming out in a couple of months or two.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:55.260]   And it's something that I really do have to remind myself
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:57.380]   that it's tough, it's hard, it's not easy,
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:26:00.220]   but if it were easy, then anybody would be able to do it.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:03.060]   Again, it's all, I was actually, I'll use a line from it.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:07.500]   I just wrote a, just a red, on Roku,
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:10.580]   I just watched a documentary on Philip Glass
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:12.780]   and one of the smartest things he says
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:14.700]   in the entire documentary, he's being asked,
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.660]   "Well, what's your secret thing?
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:16.740]   What's the secret?"
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.060]   The secret is wake up early and work hard.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:19.900]   (laughing)
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:21.500]   - Okay, no, damn.
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.380]   - You've held it with one part of this, I think.
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:26.060]   And I'm obviously, to me, you're like a model
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:27.580]   of somebody who just continually does this
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.300]   and I think it's really inspiring.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:30.980]   The other part of this though is,
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:35.020]   I think this notion that you tend to reject
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:37.540]   a lot of things that aren't a completed draft, like you say.
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.380]   You tend to go, "Oh, this is a junky first draft,"
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.020]   or "This is dumb outlining,"
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.580]   or "This is whatever, whatever, whatever."
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:44.740]   And the thing that I think,
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.340]   and I've been talking about this a lot
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:48.380]   on places like 43 folders, but this idea that I think
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.380]   once people, you start to understand
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:51.940]   that that is part of the process.
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:54.220]   That thing that feels like it's not part of the process,
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.700]   once you accept that that feeling of how much you suck
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:59.140]   is one of the most integral parts of being an artist
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:01.700]   or anybody who makes things, pretentious word.
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:02.660]   Don't you think where you go,
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:03.900]   "You know, you know what, I've done this before
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:05.420]   "and I can finish this even though I feel
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.100]   "like it's impossible right now?"
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:10.140]   - Absolutely, when I write oddly enough,
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:12.100]   I mean, when I write things that actually pay me money,
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:14.140]   I use the keyboard and I type,
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:16.060]   but the breakthrough I had writing fiction
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:17.860]   a number of years ago was to not use
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:20.540]   the word processor because I found that every time
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.780]   I would write something, I'd be like,
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:22.980]   "Oh God, I can make that better.
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.300]   "Oh Jesus, that's no way to end."
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.300]   - You tend to take around with it more.
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.060]   - Yeah, and I only made it in progress.
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:28.340]   And I only made it in progress when I said,
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.180]   "You know what, from now on,
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:30.220]   "any time I'm writing fiction,
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.020]   "I have to write it out long hand in notebooks
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:33.260]   "'cause there is no reverse gear.
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:34.620]   "It's so much trouble to cross something out
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.980]   "and rewrite it, they may as well go."
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:37.060]   - That's a good idea.
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:37.900]   - Hell, I'll fix it later.
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:39.620]   - I bought an alpha smart Andy,
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.020]   I finally went out and bought an alpha smart,
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.700]   I bought one of the alpha smart Neos.
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:46.380]   And it's called, so you guys know what this is, right?
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:48.340]   It was originally supposed to be a cheap,
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:51.260]   kind of fake laptop for kids to write on.
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:52.100]   And it's terrific.
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.620]   - Is this what you write on?
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:56.300]   - No, I generally write in a text mate or a scrivener,
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.980]   but scrivener boy, scrivener is like a pinball machine boy.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.620]   There's so many things. - Let's do what's going on.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.140]   - Text mate, oh, there's macros.
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:03.460]   The guy at Lean Crew has a new,
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:04.860]   has a new old car. - I can write a macro
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:06.580]   to write the rest of this book.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:08.980]   - I write entire manuals in text edit.
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:10.540]   - Text, I don't want to do anything.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:11.700]   I just need to put something,
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:12.660]   I just need to put text down.
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:15.140]   - Well, apparently we need one of these Neos.
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:16.860]   This is pretty, this is a stir.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.580]   - Well, here it has a mode, it has a mode.
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.660]   It's so embarrassing.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:20.500]   It has a mode, it's called,
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.060]   like it's called typing training mode.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:23.460]   And the idea is you learn how to type.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.940]   And you know, you ever take a typing test,
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:27.180]   you're not allowed to backspace, right?
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:28.020]   Same here.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.780]   So you sit down and you go into this mode.
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:31.260]   - This is a good idea.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.260]   - Ah, it's terrific.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.020]   I mean, a lot of people obsess over things like,
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:35.020]   oh, full screen mode.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.420]   Well, this has four lines.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:38.100]   (laughing)
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:38.940]   - But it doesn't have-- - But it doesn't have--
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.900]   - There's no solitaire, there's no Tetris.
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:41.740]   And so you just type,
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:42.940]   that's like you're not allowed to backspace.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.500]   And eventually your finger learns
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.980]   that you're not allowed to backspace.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:49.220]   And you on hook from the idea of editing it.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.060]   - Yeah.
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.100]   - It's kind of costly.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:53.260]   You can buy one on eBay.
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:54.780]   They're on eBay for like crazy cheap.
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:57.060]   They can get an old one for like 20 bucks on eBay.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:58.660]   - They're great, but I'm too big of an ego test.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.540]   The other big advantage of writing a notebooks
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.100]   is that when I'm finished with a story
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.740]   and I have this like three quarter of an inch
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.460]   thick stack of spiral bound paper
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:08.260]   that's all like stained and messy and dog.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:11.540]   And I wrote every damn page of this.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:12.620]   - Listen, you know what's funny?
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:15.860]   - I like to know that if I drop dead of a heart attack,
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:17.980]   people will know that I actually used to do things.
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:20.660]   I wasn't just like screwing around in the web.
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:21.660]   - Natalie Goldberg says,
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:22.780]   and again, to bring it back around,
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:25.860]   she says her job is to fill a spiral bound notebook
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.700]   every month.
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:27.540]   That's it.
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.540]   That's her job.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:29.620]   Everything else doesn't matter if it's good,
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.460]   doesn't matter if it's bad.
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:32.100]   It's simply a question of volume.
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.100]   And if you do enough volume,
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:34.100]   you'll eventually have good stuff.
[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:34.940]   - Yeah, I just want--
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:36.460]   - It's nice to have a notebook.
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.020]   - I just want to, I'm not, I want to write
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:38.940]   the great American novel.
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.140]   I don't even want to write a short story or an article.
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:43.140]   I just want to post on my vlog.
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:45.220]   Would this be any good for that?
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.540]   - Absolutely, it absolutely would
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:48.900]   because the core of the problem is exactly the same.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.940]   As I said, then that talk recently,
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:52.700]   I put a link to you on my site.
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:54.700]   It doesn't matter if you want to make an Excel spreadsheet.
[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:56.820]   The main problem is that most of us create
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:59.420]   unintentionally create barriers to getting started with stuff.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:02.260]   And what you need is the sound so dumb
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:04.820]   and it's the lizard brain that's telling you this is dumb.
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:06.780]   But you have got to accept the fact
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.220]   that the smart part of your brain
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.300]   needs to go just leave the room for a while.
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:12.340]   Because the quote unquote dumb part of your brain
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.900]   that does the actual typing is the one
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.540]   that's actually going to do a lot of the heavy lifting
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:16.900]   during the draft process.
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:18.220]   And if you let that smart part
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:20.340]   quit shouting down the dumb part,
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:21.580]   amazing things are going to come out
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.380]   that you didn't know, you even wanted to say.
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.860]   So on your blog, absolutely.
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.300]   But she has an exercise, sorry, I'm so,
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:28.660]   I'm such a fan boy for her now.
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.740]   But she says at any point where you find yourself going,
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:33.100]   oh, I don't know how to hate this, what am I writing?
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:35.300]   She says, stop, start a new line
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:37.740]   and say what I really want to say is
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:38.940]   and then go to a deeper level.
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.780]   Sounds dumb, but if you do it,
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.900]   your writing comes alive
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.820]   because you're getting past those kind of discursive
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.660]   soft thoughts.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.220]   It's good for blogs, it's good for everything, Leo.
[01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:49.060]   It's good for the Twitter, it's good for the Twitter.
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.340]   Can I use it for the Twitter?
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:51.180]   It's for the Twitter.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.900]   That's where the Twitter has succeeded
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:55.740]   is because there's no block to writing 140 characters.
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:56.940]   And the bar is low.
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:58.500]   - I got you, I got you.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.580]   - The bar is low, I love, I love Twitter.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:03.780]   - I think that's the secret success of Twitter.
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:05.980]   - If it was longer, I would start writing longer things
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:06.820]   and then I would get nervous
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:07.660]   and then I wouldn't do it anymore.
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:10.500]   - Twitter is the, what is it,
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:13.260]   the alpha smart of blogging?
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.980]   - It's haiku, haiku of blogging.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:19.260]   - It's like the birds I frozen TV dinner of writing.
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:20.100]   - Okay.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.820]   - Look on it, I put this in the oven
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.420]   and took it out again, I cooked for you.
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.060]   - I cooked it.
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.060]   - It isn't very tasty and it burned my mouth.
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.700]   - Well, I asked Jennifer,
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.340]   oh, did you make this at dinner?
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:34.540]   Which is of course the most rude thing you can ask.
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:36.300]   I show up at 6 p.m. and say,
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.220]   what's for dinner, honey?
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:38.260]   Did you make this?
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:41.380]   And she always, I have such a loser.
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:42.220]   But what she always says--
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:43.700]   - My wife, no keeper.
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:44.780]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:47.060]   She could fry up the bacon, put it up in the,
[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:50.500]   and she always says, well, I made it happen.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.540]   And that's, I think the right answer isn't it?
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:56.180]   - It's the job build every single iPhone, no, he does not.
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:59.460]   But he's the catalyst that makes it the genius catalyst.
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:00.300]   Let's get to it.
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:01.140]   - It's like itself.
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.180]   - Big it?
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:04.820]   - The BASF, we don't make the dinner, we make it better.
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.300]   - Better.
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:09.060]   Better living through chemistry.
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:11.700]   Let us get our picks of the week,
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:13.540]   and I think we know what Alex Lindsey's going to be,
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:15.940]   so I'm just gonna let him go ahead and launch right into it.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:19.220]   - I'm so excited that Tom Tom is on the iPhone.
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:20.060]   That's all I gotta say.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.100]   Here's the thing is I wasn't--
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:21.940]   - Have you been using it?
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.020]   Have you driven with it?
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.340]   - I have driven a little, I've driven around Petaluma in it.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:26.300]   It works great in Petaluma.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.620]   - But you know, it's a good test of a GPS application
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.180]   to drive around somewhere you know well.
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:31.020]   - Yeah.
[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.020]   - So whether it's giving you the right directions.
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:32.860]   - It gave me the right directions.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.580]   The thing that I was frustrated with is that it didn't come out
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:36.180]   last week because I drove down the one,
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:38.580]   and the one is a perfect example of why you need Tom Tom,
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:40.100]   or why you need a map program.
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:41.820]   'Cause people are gonna go, well you know,
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:45.260]   I have Google Maps on my iPhone.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:47.540]   On top of the fact that you don't get turned by turn,
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:49.500]   a big problem was is there were half of the time
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:53.780]   that you're on the one between San Simeon and Big Sur.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:55.860]   The phone will tell you exactly where you are,
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:56.980]   you just don't know where that is.
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:57.820]   - Right.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.540]   - You know because you know, you just get a little dot
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.620]   in the middle of a grid.
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:01.460]   - Yeah.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.620]   - There's the ocean here.
[01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:03.460]   - There's the mountains.
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.740]   - The GPS is working all the time,
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.780]   and what you need is a map program that can convert
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:09.740]   where that GPS location is into a actual location.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:10.900]   - That's the key, so there's two things.
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:12.860]   There's the maps, but there's also the intelligence.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:14.380]   - One television, gigabytes of maps.
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:15.460]   - Really, it's that big of an application?
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:16.740]   - Yeah, it's 1.2 gigabytes.
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:19.700]   It took me about 20 minutes to download at home.
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:23.900]   So now does the iPhone stay on?
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.980]   Well, you'd wanna plug it in.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.820]   Yeah, if you want to try--
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:28.580]   - It doesn't go to sleep.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:31.340]   - It won't, I haven't had it go up,
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.260]   but mine's set to stay on pretty long.
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:34.100]   - Okay.
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:34.940]   - So I haven't had it.
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.260]   - So I don't want to have to reach over every five minutes
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:38.180]   and tap the iPhone to say wake up.
[01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:39.020]   - No, I think that--
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:39.860]   - Where am I?
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.860]   - I said, I don't think that that's the case,
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:44.180]   but I haven't done any long trips in it yet.
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.500]   I mean, I just downloaded it.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:46.340]   - I just downloaded it.
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.500]   - 1.2 gigs?
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.020]   - Yes, you just heard that, huh?
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.620]   - No, I got a 32 gig I-pot.
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:51.460]   It's never happened.
[01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:52.900]   - No, I just said sorry, I was half listening.
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:53.900]   I have to go to the bathroom really bad.
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:55.340]   - Go, go, go, go, go.
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:58.300]   - You go while Alex talks. - I get my 1.2 gigs,
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.140]   holy crap, what the--
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:01.100]   - I got a 32 gig I-pot and I still haven't converted
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.100]   really in my head having more than 16 gig.
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:04.980]   - No, I can't fill up my 32 gig.
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:05.820]   - Let's put video on.
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:07.100]   - Well, it's kind of in this in between
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.140]   because I could either fill 160 gig I-pot
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:13.780]   or I can have very little,
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:15.740]   I'm just not very good at it in between.
[01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:17.540]   Then it requires me to think about what goes on it.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:20.100]   So normally my iPhone has got like eight gigs of stuff in it.
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:22.940]   So 1.2 gigs didn't seem like that big of a deal.
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:24.260]   I have Wikipedia on it too.
[01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.100]   - It looks good.
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:26.540]   - It looks like the actual TomTom.
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:28.260]   - It looks like, and the thing is I use TomTom
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:29.780]   for so long on my trio,
[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:31.140]   it is like the safe little blanket
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.900]   that it's always been so useful.
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.740]   - I'm so reluctant to spend 100 bucks though
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:35.940]   on an application for the iPhone.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.220]   - I've been waiting for this for so long.
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:38.700]   The moment I saw it available,
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:40.940]   the $99 left my account in my head.
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.780]   The moment I saw it.
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:44.940]   And this is the second one I bought.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.780]   There was someone who had one earlier on
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:49.740]   that was like 50 bucks that I paid for and I hated it.
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:54.740]   And so this one, it's just a great thing to have there.
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.220]   It does have the voice stuff.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.020]   I haven't tested the voice stuff
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.620]   'cause I don't like my GPS yelling at me.
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:04.420]   I always just wanna, I don't want to go recalculating.
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:05.260]   - Yeah.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:06.460]   - It's too much to make sense.
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:07.460]   - It doesn't do that though.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:08.300]   - It will.
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:09.260]   I mean, well, it'll talk to you.
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:10.580]   It has a talking feature.
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:11.420]   I just, they stopped.
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.700]   They realized people hated that.
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:13.540]   - Oh, I hate it.
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.380]   - Okay.
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.700]   That was the Alex Trebek Si.
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:16.540]   - Yeah.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:17.380]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:18.220]   - Yeah.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:19.540]   - I would, I would, if I could convert it,
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:21.700]   like if I could download one that's like the surfer one
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:26.700]   or the nanny from English and anyone or whatever.
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.460]   - Well, the real Tom Tom lets you do that.
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.420]   I have Dennis Hopper.
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:31.260]   - Oh, see that would be.
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:34.260]   - And he says, "You could turn left here."
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:38.460]   And then when you arrive, he says, "You're at your destination.
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:40.380]   Why would anyone want to go here, man?"
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.980]   - See that I could get into for a little while,
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:42.820]   as long as I can get to a choice.
[01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:44.220]   - You need your choice.
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:45.060]   You need your choice.
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:47.700]   They also have GLADOS from the,
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.860]   oh yeah, Andy knows what I'm talking about.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.700]   From that, what is the name of that game?
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:52.660]   I can't remember.
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:53.700]   What is it?
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:54.540]   - Portal.
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.380]   - Portal.
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.420]   You know, she's the lying computer
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:58.180]   that's trying to kill you in Portal.
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:00.500]   So she lies on the GPS when she's supposed to turn right,
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.460]   she goes, "Turn left here."
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:03.860]   (laughing)
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:06.780]   It's kind of, it makes it more of a game.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:08.500]   - Can you actually get to your love?
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.980]   - Yeah, it makes it more of a game.
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:11.620]   And then you arrive, she says,
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:13.620]   "There will be cake in the lobby."
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:14.860]   And then it's really funny.
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:17.260]   - No, I know, I love, I love these.
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:18.380]   Tom, that's one of the things Tom,
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.380]   there's a couple of things I love about Tom Tom.
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:22.380]   One is these custom voices.
[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:24.460]   It lets you upload map corrections
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.460]   to the Tom Tom server,
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:28.380]   which then are downloaded to everybody else.
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:30.620]   So you could share corrections, which is great.
[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:32.180]   But I wonder how many of these features
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:33.020]   you're gonna make for you.
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.060]   - Yeah, and I haven't tested it that heavily yet.
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:37.900]   The one thing that I will say that is important
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.180]   if you're gonna use this in the car
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:41.020]   is that you have to make sure that you get a,
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:43.380]   and this is more of a complaint towards Apple
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:44.860]   than the Tom Tom thing,
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:48.260]   is that the cars now have little USB connections.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:50.780]   So it gets exciting 'cause I could plug my phone
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:53.500]   into the USB to power it, right?
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.340]   No. - No?
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:55.180]   - Because it's not.
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:56.940]   I had a rental car this weekend
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:01.940]   that is not a approved, whatever, so now it won't charge.
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:03.940]   - So you have to bring one of these griffin
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:05.700]   or something that's designed for the iPhone
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:07.260]   that will plug into your cigarette lighter
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.100]   and keep thing going. - Yeah, what do you
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:08.940]   thought that up?
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.260]   Anyway, so-- - And Tom Tom is gonna be
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:11.700]   selling a hardware kit that has--
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:12.900]   - There's a hardware kit, and I'm gonna get one
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:13.740]   and just pop it in my car.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:14.780]   Well, the thing is that here's the worst part
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:16.580]   is I have GPS in my CRV.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.580]   This is only one I'm traveling
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:18.420]   that I really need it.
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:22.580]   I have a, the CRV has GPS, it's just that it sucks.
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:26.980]   Isn't that sad that the built-in GPS is bad?
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:27.980]   That's kind of typical.
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:31.540]   - I feel so, I feel so, I always take my new view with me
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:33.900]   whenever I go anywhere 'cause I have no sense of direction.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:35.180]   My wife isn't there, I'm lost.
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:36.780]   I'm like, she's like one of those, what?
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:38.860]   Like, one of those hawks, you know, that has the metal
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:40.420]   in her nose, like she knows magnetic--
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:42.420]   - No, no, I don't understand those people.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:45.020]   - I get lost like in our hallway.
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:46.660]   - Yeah. - You know, I've got to get a sherpa.
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:49.580]   And I mean, but the thing is that when both cases,
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:51.420]   if you don't have some kind of a mounting thing,
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:54.700]   I'm always relying on, I have one of those Griffin things.
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:59.340]   And I'm always relying on my new V or my iPhone.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.020]   So I stick it in like one of the infinite number of cup holders
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:03.980]   that's in every rental car in America.
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:05.500]   It's totally hazardous.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.740]   It's the worst I've ever--
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:09.420]   - Well, I don't see, now I don't text message while driving,
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:11.540]   but I have been known to GPS while I'm driving.
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:13.340]   - Oh, that's much better.
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:14.260]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:15.140]   (laughing)
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.100]   - And we're all trying to find some tracing.
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:18.220]   I'm driving, I'm trying to figure out
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:20.540]   where I'm gonna turn off or whatever, and I'm driving.
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:21.380]   - Yeah.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:22.380]   - And one of the guys that was with me
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.580]   for one of the shoots said,
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:25.220]   yeah, you're never gonna do that again.
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:26.060]   - Like, yeah, good.
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:27.180]   - 'Cause it was just like, it was like,
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.460]   you were driving, he's like, and this would take
[01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:31.460]   that temptation away.
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:32.460]   You know, it's just that it,
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.020]   something that's actually built to be driving
[01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:36.820]   and where you're not having to keep on recalculating.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.380]   'Cause the problem with the iPhone, you know,
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:39.660]   with the Google Maps, of course,
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.740]   is that you have to keep on recalculating from current position
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.860]   if you make a wrong turn or you pass something,
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:45.460]   you get to reset this whole system.
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:46.860]   There's no way for it to just auto-
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:48.460]   - One of the advantages of this,
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:50.420]   and this advantage at the same time,
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:52.340]   is because it's storing the maps on your iPhone,
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:54.060]   you don't have to be online for it to use it,
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:56.260]   and that's one problem with Rode, X, GPS,
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:59.380]   there are a lot of other projects out there,
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:04.380]   but I think all of them use online maps,
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:05.740]   including Google Maps.
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:07.580]   - Right, and so if you can't get online,
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:08.420]   you're--
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:09.260]   - It's gonna be much faster, too.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:10.980]   I'm not sitting there waiting for it to download.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:15.620]   If I'm in the E range, or worst of all,
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.460]   the little dot route,
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:18.020]   - Ooh, even dot range.
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:20.700]   - You know, that, I still have my map as I need it.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.140]   I mean, that was another problem I had in Big Sur,
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:24.020]   is I was trying to figure out where to get off,
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:25.980]   and I was getting some reception,
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:27.980]   but it was coming in so slow I had to pull over
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.620]   and make sure I didn't miss my turn, you know,
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:30.460]   and that's--
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:31.540]   - Do you guys think it was the off maps,
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:32.740]   have you seen that?
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:33.860]   - Off maps?
[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:36.740]   - Yeah, no, I think my friend Nelson wrote about this.
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:39.580]   It uses open maps, and basically,
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:41.420]   it's, you go in and say,
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.020]   here's the areas where I'm gonna go
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.460]   in the south of France or wherever,
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.980]   or, you know, in San Francisco,
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.500]   we don't really have coverage by AT&T,
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:50.380]   I don't know if you know that.
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:51.220]   Man, it's bad.
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:53.180]   And so you can basically, it's off maps,
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.460]   it's on the iPhone store, or iTunes store.
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:57.740]   And yeah, you go in and you can add your own little POIs
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.460]   and stuff like that.
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.300]   It's pretty cool.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:01.660]   Is there a way, like on my newbie,
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:03.180]   it's kind of a pain in the butt to do,
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.580]   you gotta use this explorer,
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:07.460]   this Garmin Explorer communicator thing.
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:08.860]   Is there a way to put your own POIs
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:10.060]   on the top tom right now?
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:14.180]   - Ah, I don't know, I haven't tried--
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.740]   - You know what I'd love to do when I'm gonna go on a trip,
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.740]   I go into another free tip.
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:20.060]   I go into Google Maps, and I'll go make an entire,
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.380]   I'll go put it all on Google Maps.
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:22.420]   Every place I'm going,
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:24.220]   I always want another closest place to get a stake
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:26.100]   after 8 p.m. where the ATMs are,
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:28.180]   where the drug store and where the liquor store is.
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:29.540]   And ideally, where the emergency room is.
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:32.100]   - You've got your priorities, dude.
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:34.260]   - But what you can do is you can just,
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:36.300]   there's a K, I guess that's a KML file, I'm not sure,
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.660]   but you basically just upload that under your newbie.
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:42.020]   And then when you arrive there, everything's right there.
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:42.860]   - That's great.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:45.460]   Yeah, I mean, I'm a graduate of the newbie too.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:48.060]   And that's why I'm a little bit disappointed with Tom Tom
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:51.420]   and the 20, 30 miles I've driven with it so far.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:53.580]   One of the things I loved about the newbie is that
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.780]   the purpose of a GPS is not to be a computer
[01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:57.380]   that you pay close attention to.
[01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:00.100]   The purpose is to be a third or a fourth rearview mirror.
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:02.100]   Something where, okay, rearview, good and clear,
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:03.180]   rearview, good and clear.
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.140]   Do I need to make a turn left?
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.340]   Glance, yep, that's coming up soon.
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:08.460]   I would, I miss there things like on the newbie,
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:10.620]   there'd always be, here's a big bar that says,
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.940]   here's the next thing you're gonna have to be prepared to do.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:14.260]   I don't care if it's 20 miles ahead, but just--
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.260]   - Yeah, I want that.
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:16.100]   - Yeah, right.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:19.100]   - Well, also, because often do you need to repeat it?
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:20.660]   Like in my case, it's in the rental car,
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:21.940]   it's in the van or whatever.
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.900]   And unfortunately I've put it so the screen is up,
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:25.100]   but the speaker's down.
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.500]   And I heard there was something in 500 feet,
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.340]   but I'm not sure what, do I go left, do I go right?
[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:30.620]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:31.460]   Well, it does.
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.300]   - Go ahead.
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.620]   - Tom Tom works well, it actually not only does it,
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:37.460]   does it, if you have the iPod application running,
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:40.380]   it doesn't simply mute it, it actually pauses the playback.
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:41.460]   So it'll give you the direction,
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:42.820]   and then it picks up in the audio book
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.420]   exactly where you were.
[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:46.460]   But I just wish there were more little bits of information
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:47.580]   in the corners of the screen.
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:50.220]   One thing I loved about the newbie was that,
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:51.820]   there are hot corners, so you could easily just,
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:53.340]   without really looking, without taking your eyes
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:54.700]   off the road, just reach up and just,
[01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:56.820]   I would always know that if I grab the near corner
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:59.860]   of the screen, whatever it is, the next three steps
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.380]   are gonna be in big letters on the screen,
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:03.220]   and it's gonna stay there for about 20 seconds.
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:05.380]   - Yeah, it's cool with the menu bar.
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:06.420]   Like with the fattest finger,
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:07.780]   you just aim for the top of the screen,
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:08.620]   and it's like, you know what would be great?
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:10.540]   You know what the feature that they should add though?
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:12.780]   You should be able to, something that Omni Focus does
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:14.260]   that I like a lot is it'll say,
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:17.740]   like I can enter things like business types of businesses,
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:20.060]   I could say, next time I'm near a target,
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:21.700]   remind me to do this thing.
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:22.780]   I would be so great if that,
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:24.140]   at the Tom Tom had a way of saying,
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:26.420]   like I like in an outburger.
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:28.020]   Like I'm not around in an outburger a lot,
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:29.940]   but I'd love to know when I'm near one.
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.500]   I'd like to know, you know what I'm saying?
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:34.340]   I like there's certain kinds of things that you'd like to know.
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:37.500]   My killer app for this kind of stuff
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.500]   that I would love to see someone like Tom Tom do
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.020]   is GPS tours where you could take,
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:43.220]   like you could say, I want to download
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:46.460]   the tour of the Civil War battlefields,
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:47.300]   and it literally just has--
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:49.220]   - You can buy those for the newbie.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.140]   - And so they're activated by your GPS location.
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:56.180]   - You can also upload, you can upload stop-like cameras,
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:59.900]   you can basically upload a stop-like camera in America,
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:01.700]   but you can buy these tours where it'll trigger
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:02.980]   based on where you are and say,
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:05.140]   okay, you're near the world's largest ball of twine
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:05.980]   or whatever.
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:06.820]   - Right.
[01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:09.860]   - I've got sex, dear ways, dear ways.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.020]   - Because that's something I haven't seen done very,
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.100]   or very much.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.620]   - So I'm really--
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:17.780]   - What's sort of what you said, Andy,
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.940]   like we rely on these things to pay attention for us
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:21.780]   and it'd be kind of neat.
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:23.780]   I love anything that will do that for me
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:24.700]   in a contextual way.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:26.100]   Again, think about the SIVO.
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:28.740]   In my case, I'll say, you know, I like Ricu Gervais.
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:30.820]   Just go ahead and record everything that says Ricu Gervais
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:32.700]   or C.N. Miller, she's cute.
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:34.700]   Like, get everything that's got C.N. Miller in it.
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:35.900]   And I don't think about it.
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:36.780]   I don't just sit there and go,
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:38.580]   oh, flip through the TV guide.
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:40.540]   In the same instance, the whole point of this thing
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.060]   is it does the thinking for me.
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:44.020]   It'd be nice to have more of that kind of contextual stuff
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:44.860]   along the way.
[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:46.580]   - So none of this, I should make clear,
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.180]   is in the iPhone app.
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:49.180]   - No.
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:50.540]   - No, it's pretty basic.
[01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:51.380]   - It's a beginning.
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:53.180]   - I have faith that it's the beginning.
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:54.020]   - Yeah.
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:55.380]   - Well, it's not just, well, it's not the beginning.
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:56.180]   It is the next step.
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:58.260]   There are other turn-by-turn direction nav apps.
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:01.940]   I'm really, really interested in taking a look at the GMAP
[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:04.580]   because it's the typical problem
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:06.060]   of reviewing things in the app store.
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:08.100]   Well, you'll look at 1.0 and you hate it,
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:10.780]   and then you sort of put it out of your mind for forever.
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:12.420]   And so it took me a while to realize it,
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:14.420]   oh, well, actually, there have been like four different versions
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:15.660]   of GMAP updated.
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:17.220]   And the specs look very, very good.
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:19.020]   The video also looks very, very good.
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:21.660]   It looks like it has the sort of display that I like.
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:24.220]   Again, that little, that pewge icon in the corner
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:25.980]   that simply says the next thing you're gonna be doing
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:27.140]   is you're gonna be turning right.
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.020]   So this would not be a bad,
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:30.660]   this would not be a good time to be in the left lane
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:31.860]   of an eight lane road.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:35.020]   It seems to have better management of POIs.
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.180]   It seems to have better route management.
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:39.620]   Again, seems to, seems to, seems to.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:41.260]   So it's 24-- - It's 24, which is nice,
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:42.980]   but it's smaller regions.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:45.580]   - Well, GMAP is 34, I think, isn't it?
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:47.940]   - I'm looking at the California GMAP, and that's 27.
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:49.820]   - Sorry, the EC, yeah.
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.500]   They don't sell you the entire map set, which is good,
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:54.940]   'cause the East Coast version,
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:57.700]   which covers the entire Eastern Seaboard, is $34.99.
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:59.500]   So you can just buy what you want.
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:03.740]   It is at the point where I might, you know, 34.99.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:06.460]   If I'm writing my review of TomTom, I'll say,
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:11.380]   "Okay, I'll spend 34.99 of my own money just to test this out.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:13.540]   "If I don't hear it from the developers to give me a code,
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:15.300]   "but I'm really not gonna be happy about it."
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:16.780]   With TomTom, it was like,
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:18.740]   "Can you please give me a code for this?
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:21.140]   "If I have to buy it, I will, but that means I'll have to wait
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:23.980]   "until my cable bill is paid and make sure grandma has her
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:27.380]   "insulinna, then after that, I'll be buying your application."
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:30.260]   But yeah, it does look like it's gonna be the,
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:32.740]   it's between TomTom and G. Map at this point.
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:34.140]   - I just wanna share this quickly.
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:37.900]   So I plunged into off-maps, 'cause Nelson liked it.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:41.260]   But it's funny, I'd only grabbed the very local San Francisco maps,
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:42.780]   and right now I'm in airplane mode,
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:44.500]   'cause I'm a responsible podcaster.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:45.420]   But I love this.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:47.580]   Do you remember how in old maps,
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:48.900]   a long time ago, in old maps,
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:51.540]   when you got to the edge of, you know the Sandy, I'm sure,
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:55.020]   when you got to the end of where known map territory was,
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:56.540]   what did it say in big script letters?
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:57.980]   - Here be monsters.
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:45:58.980]   - Here be dragons.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:01.220]   - And like right here, when you run out of map.
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:02.580]   - Here be dragons.
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:04.820]   - Yeah, you just get these giant caution things.
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.460]   Like don't go there, there might be giant
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:07.980]   exclamation points somewhere in general.
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:09.820]   - I hate that, I hate that one.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:12.820]   - Deeperon's full of exclamation marks, get out.
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:14.180]   - Well now I don't know what to buy.
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:15.820]   Now I'm talking--
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:17.020]   - Oh, buy it all, EO.
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.780]   Buy it all your fifth time.
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:20.780]   - No upgrade it, so you buy it and then you're pushing me up.
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:22.140]   - I'm tempted to buy G map.
[01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:25.020]   Actually, I like, it looks like it has 3D,
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:26.620]   like you said video views.
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:28.500]   - It does see, the thing that I really wanna check out
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:30.100]   is that they seem to have a view in which it will try
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:32.460]   to reconstruct the intersection as it actually exists.
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:35.940]   So instead of seeing a flat map, a 2D map that's been layered
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:39.020]   flat with sort of an idea of what's ahead of you,
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:40.380]   you will actually see overpasses,
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:42.060]   you will actually see buildings,
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:44.460]   it actually has a certain amount of realistic shading.
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:47.940]   I'd like to know how much of that is based on like Google data
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:50.660]   and how much of that actual recoverable data
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:52.140]   and how much of that as well.
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:55.020]   It says that this is a thickly populated area,
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:57.660]   so we won't put quite so many cows in the intersection
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:59.140]   as there was in the last screen.
[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:00.900]   - But that's a good thing about the new view also, Andy,
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.100]   don't you think is the level of granularity?
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:04.500]   But you know what would be awesome is to take that
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.260]   to the next level and say like for me,
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:07.980]   like last time I was in LA, don't ask,
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:09.860]   I wanted to get, I wear these stupid overpriced
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:12.460]   American apparel t-shirts and I really wanted to get some more.
[01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:14.260]   And so I went and I searched and there was like
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:16.260]   seven different places where it was like on Google
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:17.900]   where it was like a dress unverified.
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:20.020]   Like maybe it's there, I walked like 30 blocks
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:22.460]   and I'm totally in this like terrible neighborhood.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:23.860]   I wish there were a way on all of these
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:25.020]   where you could say at a certain level,
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.700]   I want certain kinds of things to happen.
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:29.780]   If I'm on an uneventful highway for N miles,
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:31.860]   if nothing's gonna happen, don't bug me.
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:33.860]   But I want you to tell me every 15 minutes
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.780]   how far it is until I need to do something.
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:38.100]   And then B, when I do get to a certain level
[01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:39.780]   of where I need to be, like how often do you get
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:40.940]   to an off ramp?
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.620]   And suddenly there's seven things you have to do
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:43.860]   like in the next few minutes.
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:46.300]   It would be great if A, it got much more granular
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:48.260]   and clear at the point when you needed that guidance.
[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:52.540]   And B, you should be able to say when I get within N feet
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:54.340]   or whatever miles of where I'm going,
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:57.540]   show me street view data where I can actually see
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:59.140]   what corner should I park on?
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:00.780]   That would be incredibly useful.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:02.620]   - It's interesting how far though we've come.
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:04.940]   I mean these things have gotten so much more useful.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:06.660]   And the fact that we're asking for these kinds of
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:08.940]   additional, you know, fillips.
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:11.500]   - Sir, I also wanted to tell me if the hot tricks
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:12.500]   are still there.
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:13.340]   (laughing)
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:15.580]   - Yeah, shows that, I mean, these things are pretty amazing.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:17.420]   And the fact that they're on the phone is even--
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:20.380]   - And I have to admit, I think the GMAP was actually the one.
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:21.300]   Now I looked at it.
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:22.540]   GMAP was actually the one that I bought
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:23.380]   when it first came out.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.180]   And this is the one that made me absolutely insane
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:25.940]   'cause it didn't work.
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:26.780]   - Right.
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:27.620]   - It looks like it's gotten better.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:29.300]   - It sounds like it's gotten a lot of updates
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:30.420]   that have made it a lot better.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:32.100]   Because when I was driving through Arizona
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:33.820]   and just totally screwed, I mean,
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:35.260]   you just, you went back to G.
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:36.940]   - Well, that's one thing it's very hard to measure
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:38.700]   is how accurate this thing is gonna be.
[01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:40.340]   - Well, and that's why I bought the Tom Tom
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.180]   was because I was just like--
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:42.700]   - We know Tom Tom has good maps, yeah.
[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:44.100]   - You know, I know, it may not have all the bells
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:46.180]   and whistles that I want, but when I'm in the middle,
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:49.380]   and when I'm halfway between Taos and Santa Fe,
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:51.180]   I'm actually gonna know where I'm at.
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:52.620]   You know, and that's the part that--
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:55.420]   - Kinda like the way you fail over from, you know,
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:59.460]   wifi to 3G to E to DOT.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:00.780]   It'd be kind of nice if there was some kind of,
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:01.620]   I wanna set the word.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.460]   You know what I'm saying though?
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:03.300]   It'd be kind of nice if there are a way
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:04.860]   to have a little bit of redundancy.
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:05.700]   That's the nice thing.
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:06.900]   - Graceful degradation.
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:08.060]   - That's very nicely, I like that.
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:09.180]   Like if you don't have the JavaScript,
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:12.180]   you get this thing that says you don't have JavaScript.
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:13.820]   - It's like the story of my life.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:17.340]   - Let's get to your pick Andy Enochko.
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:19.420]   What do you got for us today?
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:22.500]   - Well, my pick is TomTom GPS Navigator for I-comch.
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:24.580]   (laughing)
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:26.540]   No, no, no, just a little--
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:28.060]   - A little jest, eh?
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.420]   - Oh no, by picking Alex first,
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:30.740]   you saved me the pleasure of saying,
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:33.540]   well, I guess I better make my pick this week
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:34.860]   so I can't do it next week.
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.660]   Well, mine is actually quite a quick and simpler.
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:41.380]   It's just a little utility from St. Clair software,
[01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:44.620]   excuse me, called, I just lost it.
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:46.460]   - It's so little, you lost it.
[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:49.980]   - Yes, it's a little utility called default folder X.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:51.500]   - Oh, I love this full program.
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:52.820]   - Which I like a lot.
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:55.660]   It is a huge like open save dialogue enhancer
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:58.180]   that with this activated near preface pane,
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:00.700]   when any time that the OS needs to throw up
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:02.780]   a open or save dialogue,
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:04.340]   it'll open up the standard dialogue,
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:08.180]   but it will be framed in a nice little translucent frame
[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:09.540]   with extra icons and extra features on it.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:10.900]   - I haven't used this in several versions,
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:13.220]   but I didn't stop working with Tiger or Panther or something
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:15.220]   and then for a while it didn't work.
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:16.820]   And is this so it's back?
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:18.660]   - It's back and it's back and it works fine.
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:19.740]   As a matter of fact, the latest version
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:21.580]   just came out about a week ago,
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:23.940]   but it doesn't do hugely magical things.
[01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:26.620]   It just simply lets you set up this folder,
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:29.220]   set up this behavior to do exactly what you want it to do.
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:31.460]   So for instance, you can set automatic defaults
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:33.700]   for each individual application that you use.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.460]   You can have your own sets of favorites
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:39.180]   that are located inside these little sidebar icons.
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:40.700]   One feature I really like is that
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:43.140]   you have access to full finder previews
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:45.700]   within that actual open save dialogue.
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:49.460]   So if I'm opening a file by don't know
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:54.460]   whether it's Forbidden City, Panorama 841
[01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:58.020]   or Panorama 842 or 847 from iPhone,
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:00.900]   I can get access to really good big previews
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:03.060]   without having to change my finder view.
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:05.220]   I also like the fact that you can actually add,
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:06.780]   when you're saving a new file, for instance,
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:08.780]   you can add spot like comments to the box
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:11.540]   to make that file easier to find.
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:12.980]   I don't know why Apple doesn't let you do that
[01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:16.020]   because one of the biggest power tips you can have
[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:17.860]   if you're always creating files
[01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:19.420]   and never be able to find them later on
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:21.100]   is to put labels and keywords
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:23.180]   inside the spot like comments box.
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:24.140]   - It's also persistent.
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:26.380]   So if you're doing that to a whole bunch of stuff at once,
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:28.620]   it remembers what you tagged last time for that.
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:29.540]   - Right, exactly.
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:31.940]   - So command you, how much do you love command you?
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:33.380]   Do you use that a lot?
[01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:34.940]   - Yeah, it's what's command you do.
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:38.060]   - Go to the default folder for this application.
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:39.460]   - Oh, that's good for that application.
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:40.380]   It's always in command D
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:41.540]   and putting everything on the desktop.
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:42.900]   So this is the equivalent right away.
[01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:44.420]   - And you can also add command keys
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:46.380]   to most other popular areas
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:47.780]   or popular folders that are inside.
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:50.940]   So it's one of those utilities that I find
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:52.220]   a little bit dangerous.
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:55.500]   I don't use Quicksilver specifically because I hate to,
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:58.380]   I would hate to get so dependent on something this useful.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:59.820]   And then when I'm at someone else's Mac,
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:01.580]   I'm suddenly absolutely Elmer Fudd.
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:03.580]   - It's like typing without fingers.
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:04.740]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:06.620]   But I've been using it for the past week and a half now
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:08.340]   and like, oh boy, you can get used to this.
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:10.260]   Especially when you're managing a big project
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:11.900]   where there's a project folder
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:13.220]   and then there's the media folder
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.500]   and then there's the upload folder
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.100]   and then there's the good happens.
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:16.940]   Why does that give you some?
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:17.860]   - The dragging from the finder
[01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:19.660]   the dragging from the finder is amazing too.
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:24.420]   You can, so if you focus over to the desktop or to finder,
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:27.900]   you can drag stuff from the finder into that window
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:29.100]   and jump straight.
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:30.900]   Can you do it in the finder right now normally?
[01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:32.460]   - That's a standard finder feature.
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:34.500]   - Oh, okay, you can also do this thing where you print.
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:36.700]   (laughing)
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:38.180]   Does it have search?
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:39.100]   - This is like firefox.
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:39.980]   This is just like firefox.
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:41.980]   With firefox, you get so used to your entire world,
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:43.660]   you're constantly thinking things are broken
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:45.020]   because you're seeing this version of the world
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:45.860]   that's completely unique.
[01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:47.340]   - Right, right, right.
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:50.140]   Sounds good and it is not free, it is what,
[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:52.500]   34 bucks, 35 bucks.
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:53.900]   - What if I bucks you can try it for free?
[01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:57.260]   It's for people who are in certain work flow situations,
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.540]   it'll be a quick 35 bucks.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:00.500]   - Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
[01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:03.100]   - A Merlin man, you have a pick for us, my friend?
[01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:06.780]   - Yeah, I do, as you know, a lot of my work is
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:10.700]   in the space around productivity and creative work
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:13.780]   and I guess just trying to be a little bit more organized
[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:15.060]   than on top of stuff.
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:17.940]   And so my pick for this week is an application
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:19.380]   called Pocket God.
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:20.220]   (laughing)
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:22.740]   - I love Pocket God.
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:25.540]   - You kick pygmies into a volcano.
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:27.420]   - Well, there's a new chapter every few weeks
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:29.220]   so you can do different things, yeah.
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:30.740]   - It's difficult to do, but.
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:32.620]   - You're doing it upside down.
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:34.820]   - He's like the ginger rogers of Pocket God.
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:36.540]   He's doing it backwards in a hot deal.
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:38.540]   - You kick him into a volcano and then see it erupts
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:39.380]   and it erupts on.
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:40.220]   - Oh, you did it.
[01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:42.020]   Wow, you spent some time doing this.
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:44.380]   - You make a bird poop on him too.
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:45.220]   And it's called Pocket God.
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:46.660]   - You can feed him to the shark?
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:48.540]   - It's the first iPhone game I ever bought
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:49.620]   and I can't stop playing.
[01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:51.300]   (laughing)
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:52.500]   And it let me, it let me down a road
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:53.500]   because then I bought, so then,
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:56.140]   and Jonathan Colton told me about this B-bot application
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:58.300]   which is like a little synthesizer, I bought that.
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:01.500]   I bought that stupid air traffic control game
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:04.660]   that I can't stop playing and somebody take this away from me.
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:09.420]   Pocket God's inexpensive, but like you say, Leo,
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:12.140]   they add a new feature every week to three weeks.
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:13.260]   - It's really awesome.
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:15.700]   - This week, you can bounce coconuts off people's heads
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:16.900]   where you can spare people.
[01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:17.740]   - Right.
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:19.700]   See, it's fun until you find yourself
[01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:21.260]   shouting the names of friends, family,
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:22.900]   and coworkers as you're killing people.
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:24.540]   (laughing)
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:25.380]   - I daughter my daughter.
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:26.740]   - Take my stapler, will you, Josh?
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:28.660]   Well, who's giving you the stapler now?
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:30.740]   (laughing)
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:32.820]   Do you ever have a shark bounce on your head, Josh?
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:35.500]   (laughing)
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:36.900]   - It's very fun, I have to admit,
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:39.700]   and it is addictive if you wanna be a God.
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:41.020]   - I'm not gonna cut back on my games
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:41.860]   'cause it's not the same thing.
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:42.940]   - Are you still doing a field runner's thing
[01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:43.780]   or you've moved on?
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:47.420]   - No, I got up to about 100 level 156,
[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:50.420]   and I'm kinda stuck there and I decided I have to stop.
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:51.260]   - Yeah.
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:52.100]   - New game?
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:53.780]   I know I'm not, I'm trying not to--
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:55.180]   - Don't do I dig this.
[01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:56.620]   - I have it here and I played it once
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:59.100]   and I haven't, it hasn't, the cocaine hasn't sunk in.
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:54:59.940]   - Oh yeah.
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:02.260]   - Before I develop an addiction, I decided to--
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:03.900]   - That's the one I wake up at three in the morning.
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:06.980]   - And so I've been, I really tried to keep my stuff,
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:08.180]   what was great about field runners
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:09.940]   is I could turn it on and off all the time.
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:11.820]   So I play a couple levels while I'm standing in line
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:12.900]   and then I'd move on and I could play
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:13.900]   another couple levels here and there.
[01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:18.900]   I never felt like the need to play any more than that.
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:22.540]   So I'm trying to stay productive for at least a little while.
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:24.460]   I did, you know, anyway.
[01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:26.020]   - They're suggesting the chat remerlin
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:28.780]   because of your appearance that I bring back Pizziz.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:30.780]   There's an iPhone Pizziz app,
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:33.060]   but I'm not gonna do that to you.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:33.900]   - You know what the problem,
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:35.380]   the problem with these things, like, okay,
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.700]   and so it gets disclosure, I have a bunch of these,
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:40.660]   I have some of those brainwave apps, I have a few of those.
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:42.300]   There's an amazing one, if you're into this stuff,
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:45.220]   there's one called Ambience, that's amazing.
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:47.300]   If you're only gonna buy one of these dumb noise apps
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:49.300]   by Ambience, how's that for a pull quote?
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:53.940]   - Berlin man says our app stupid, you should buy it.
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:55.620]   - Ambience, you go in and you basically have
[01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:58.460]   all these free downloadable sounds that you can get
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.300]   and you can do mixes.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:02.100]   So basically, you can do,
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:04.220]   while you're listening to your pavement record,
[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:07.860]   you can also go in and say, for example,
[01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:10.700]   I wanna hear the sound of lunes and pink noise.
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:14.040]   (screaming)
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:17.220]   - And the people in Hepburn,
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:20.980]   nomen, yo, poop, it's the lones nomen.
[01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:23.140]   - Hey, let's talk to your mother like that, Tom.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:26.220]   But no, but you can listen to your music while you're doing it.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:27.340]   So if you're like me and you wanna listen
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:29.580]   to Thunder Road on repeat while you're trying to write,
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:34.260]   I know that's on your Skype status for the last three weeks.
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:35.900]   Listening to Thunder Road.
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:36.740]   (laughing)
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:38.500]   - Like good record, yeah.
[01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:40.180]   Going out tonight to case the promised land.
[01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:41.860]   - Did you see, actually that's what Bob Dylan
[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:43.340]   was apparently doing, you see the-
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:44.460]   - Documentary, seeing that documentary
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:46.420]   about the making of the board to run?
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:48.620]   - No, I haven't, but apparently Dylan was picked up
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:49.460]   by a cop.
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:51.620]   - They thought he was a hobo.
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:53.940]   - Thought he was a hobo, two blocks from the house
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:55.980]   where a spring scene wrote Born to Run.
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:57.700]   And they found out he was a musician,
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:59.500]   which was even worse.
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:02.060]   - This 22 year old girl cop,
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:03.500]   doesn't know, Roseam in the back of the car
[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.340]   said you look like a vagrant to me.
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:07.020]   - And then there were two people,
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:08.780]   then there's a second one, like,
[01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:09.620]   they were like what's your name,
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:10.940]   and he goes, Bob Dylan, okay, how do you spell that?
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:12.700]   And then they take a rent.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.900]   You know, arguably the most important cultural figure
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:17.020]   of the second half of the turning century.
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:19.980]   But then there was like another person, I guess,
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:21.500]   and at no point somebody would go,
[01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:22.980]   oh, you're that-
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:24.620]   - You're that folk guy.
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:25.460]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:26.300]   - Hey, hey, hey.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.300]   - How cool is that?
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:28.740]   How cool is that that he didn't go like,
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:29.660]   "I'm that demon!"
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:32.820]   - Yeah, no, he was cool, he was calm, he was quiet.
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:34.740]   Apparently he's been making a pilgrimage
[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:36.740]   'cause he was at Neil Young's birthplace.
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:39.020]   A couple other places.
[01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:41.380]   - If you haven't listened to Born to Run lately,
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:45.020]   I will repost a video this moment on Kung Fu Grip
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.300]   for about the 15th time.
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:50.260]   There's a live version of Thunder Road from 1975.
[01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:52.780]   Bruce Springsteen arrives in London.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:53.740]   He's losing it.
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:56.700]   He's been told, everybody says he's the next Dylan.
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:58.780]   Expectations are high, there's posters everywhere
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:57:59.780]   saying he's the next Dylan.
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:00.620]   - I'm not sure the pressure.
[01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:01.460]   - Which is kind of out of pressure.
[01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:02.620]   And he goes out there, and to this day,
[01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:03.980]   he thinks it's a terrible show.
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:06.740]   It's one of the most mind-blowing Springsteen shows ever.
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:08.100]   And he opens with an acoustic,
[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:09.940]   kind of quiet version of Thunder Road
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:10.980]   that'll just curl your hair.
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:12.380]   It's the most inspiring,
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.580]   one of the most inspiring live performances I've ever seen.
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:15.540]   And I will post it for you.
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:17.540]   - Please do, 'cause I want to see that.
[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:19.660]   - I've got the 30th anniversary set,
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:23.180]   and it's got a documentary called Wings for Wheels.
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:24.740]   And it's a documentary of it.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:27.060]   Boy, wow, hour three, sorry.
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:29.180]   (laughing)
[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:31.020]   - The show was gonna be a really short show
[01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:32.020]   'cause there was no news.
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:33.740]   - Spies should only once a month.
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:35.460]   - We're now going for a record.
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:36.820]   - No, we love it, I don't care.
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:37.660]   - Fantastic care, I'm enjoying that.
[01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:39.420]   - That's a comeback, the whole rest of the month.
[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:41.860]   - Yeah, we've done it, we've done a new iPod next month.
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:43.420]   - Yeah, we'll talk to you, we'll see you in September.
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:44.260]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:45.780]   - In the ground, but keep reaching for the stuff.
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:48.580]   - So briefly, I'll do this very briefly,
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:52.380]   our friend, Gina Trapani, who does this week in Google's show,
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:55.020]   blogged a couple of weeks ago,
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:57.660]   that she'd finally tried Mint.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:59.140]   Now, this isn't the Mint you were talking about,
[01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:01.340]   Merlin, which is the stats package.
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:05.500]   This is confusingly a financial stats package called Mint
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:08.220]   at MintMINT.com.
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:09.820]   And I had tried it when they first came out,
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:12.180]   and I'm typing in my credit card number,
[01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:14.180]   and I'm thinking, wait a minute.
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.260]   (laughing)
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:17.300]   What am I doing?
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:19.540]   So I stopped and I canceled my account and everything.
[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:21.780]   But then Gina said, a couple of weeks ago,
[01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:24.100]   she had the same reaction, she went back to Mint,
[01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:26.540]   she investigated, they used the same service
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:29.620]   that banks used to protect all this stuff.
[01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:32.500]   I, so, you know, based on Gina's recommendation,
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:34.340]   I tried it again, and I have to say,
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:35.220]   it's gotten much better.
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:36.780]   You, it took me about five minutes
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:38.420]   to set it up with my bank accounts,
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:42.140]   and I am getting amazing reports back from Mint.
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:44.980]   But here's the thing, there's an iPhone app
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:47.180]   that you can get just the dashboard
[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:50.900]   of your financial status at any given time.
[01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:52.940]   It says, you know, here's how much is in your account,
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:54.900]   here's how much you owe, here's your budget,
[01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:55.940]   how you stand in your budget,
[01:59:55.940 --> 01:59:57.460]   your cash flow for the month,
[01:59:57.460 --> 01:59:58.580]   how your investments are doing.
[01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:02.260]   By the way, I'm down $10,000, thank you very much.
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:04.980]   Well, this is since August 13th, saying this in.
[02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:06.380]   - Is that your sky impersonation?
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.420]   - Yeah, really.
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:08.860]   Well, no, the stock market's been tanking
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:10.220]   since we've been talking, I don't know if it's--
[02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:13.540]   - I'm down, I'm down, I'm down.
[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:15.260]   - We followed the three out of pocket.
[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:16.100]   - I'm already here.
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:17.380]   - I'm not the old standard when we started.
[02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:18.740]   - But it's good, 'cause you could see
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:20.820]   what money's been spent, you know,
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:22.140]   I noticed it'll ding you,
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:23.740]   that there was a big transaction,
[02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:25.940]   did you know about this check and so forth?
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:27.900]   It's really-- - I had the same reaction,
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:29.180]   I downloaded it quickly and then got,
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:31.580]   ooh, I'm scared and then backed off.
[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:32.980]   - It's safe. - Okay.
[02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:36.260]   - They use the same exchange service that banks use,
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:38.140]   so your information is not stored in Mint,
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:39.860]   it's stored with the people who already frankly
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:42.980]   know everything about you, anyway.
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:46.020]   But what's nice is the banks have really worked with them,
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:47.900]   all your accounts going very quickly,
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:49.540]   your credit cards, your checking accounts,
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:51.460]   your savings accounts, your investment accounts,
[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:54.540]   even your mortgage, and you get an instant net worth,
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:56.940]   it sounds like you were using it, Merlin.
[02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:57.780]   - Oh, it's tremendous.
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:00.420]   And you know how the first time you open up Mail.app
[02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:02.580]   on the Mac and you're like, oh,
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:05.020]   there's all of my email accounts in one window,
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:07.780]   that's really amazing why I'd ever have that before.
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:09.340]   So go, here's my bank account, here's my savings,
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:11.460]   here's my PayPal, have that all in one place
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:13.220]   and all tagged with the same tax,
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:15.100]   it's not a, why does that matter?
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:16.340]   'Cause you set a budget.
[02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:18.700]   And you say, I buy gas with any of these media,
[02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.780]   doesn't matter what, I want that under caps.
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:22.900]   And you can create your own custom categories.
[02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:25.740]   And the notifications are great,
[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:26.900]   'cause you can say if my bank account
[02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:29.220]   gets below $5, let me know, or something like that.
[02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:30.180]   - I've never bounced a check again,
[02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:31.540]   that's why Gina did it, she said,
[02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:33.820]   I bounced a check and I thought, what am I doing here?
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:35.420]   - It's ugly, I go straight to bringing around,
[02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:36.580]   I go straight to your point earlier though,
[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:38.700]   it's intelligence and insight into something
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:42.340]   that is very hard to capture based on anecdotal evidence.
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:44.540]   It's just straight numbers, it's like here's what you spent
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:48.500]   on everything, and it's up there with Gmail
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:50.780]   and Flickr as easily one of the best web applications
[02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:51.900]   I've ever used. - It blows me away.
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:54.620]   Now it's absolutely free, the way they support it is,
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:56.740]   because they know a lot about, for instance,
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:59.940]   what your home loan is, they support it with kind of,
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:03.620]   I think fairly unintrusive comments like,
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:05.260]   you could be saving a little money if you borrowed
[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:07.620]   from these guys, or you could get a better credit card
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:10.180]   from these guys, or here's a zero percent credit card.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:12.900]   It clearly is well monetized because there's a lot
[02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:14.540]   of money to be made, but it does not annoying,
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:16.460]   it's not insulting.
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:17.820]   - I downloaded it.
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:19.820]   - It really replaces Quickin', I don't think you need
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:21.020]   Quickin' anymore, right?
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:22.900]   - Quickin'. - Quickin', what's that?
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:23.820]   You don't know what that is?
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:24.660]   - Yeah.
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:25.620]   - Don't remember that.
[02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:28.220]   Microsoft money, they went out of business too.
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:32.580]   Anyway, I love it, Mint, and I do feel now safe with it,
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:34.820]   and the iPhone app is just a little icing on the cake,
[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:39.020]   so it is a web app, but there's a little Mac connection
[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:40.460]   'cause of the iPhone app.
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:44.020]   Mint, m-i-n-t-i-com, wow, we've gone way over time,
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:45.140]   but this has been so much fun.
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:48.340]   Merlin, we really are thrilled to have you on the show again.
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:49.420]   - Let's be back, I missed you guys.
[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:51.300]   - Oh, we missed you, I mean, it's not the same show
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:53.380]   without you, so any time.
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:55.380]   - That's probably been beneficial.
[02:02:55.380 --> 02:02:56.540]   - Yeah, you know what I'm saying, it's great,
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:57.620]   I just said it's not the same show.
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.020]   - I did notice you were clear.
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:00.540]   (laughing)
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:02.260]   - Now, we really love having you.
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:04.420]   Look forward to the book, your Inbox Zero book,
[02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:06.420]   you say it's gonna be next year.
[02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:09.500]   - Yeah, Harper Studio, putting out next year.
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:11.300]   And so, InboxZero.com, we'll have some stuff up
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:15.940]   probably later today, and b-i-t-t-l-y/thunderroad.
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:17.540]   One word, we'll take you to that video.
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:19.140]   - I'm loving it.
[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:21.220]   - Thanks for having me back on YouTube.

[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:27.300]   - Go back and listen to the Vichina episode,
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:28.620]   it's easily our most offensive
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:30.660]   and it's probably our best.
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:32.620]   It's an hour long and it sounds,
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:34.660]   just like it sounds, Vichina, it's bad.
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:36.780]   - They're all great, they're all great.
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:38.100]   I can't go into-- - They stand up,
[02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.820]   they stand up to repeat listening.
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:41.260]   I can't go into Starbucks anymore
[02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:42.380]   without giving them a weird name.
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:43.820]   I mean, just on and on and on.
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:48.740]   It's become a cultural phenomenon.
[02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:49.580]   You look nice today.
[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:51.980]   - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:52.820]   - All right.
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:56.260]   - And EnochoC-W-O-B.com in the Chicago Sun Times.

[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:13.420]   - And we've got lots of great new Mac break studio and devs.
[02:04:13.420 --> 02:04:15.660]   The devs are going crazy geeky.
[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:17.940]   - Fantastic. - So lots of Xcode
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:19.540]   conversations in AppleScript.
