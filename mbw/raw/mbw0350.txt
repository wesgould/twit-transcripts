[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Mike Elgin joins Renee Ritchie and Andy Inako.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.080]   We're gonna have some great discussions including the idea of the iPhone being a
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.840]   fingerprint reader, identity and more. Whether Apple can actually read your
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.760]   encrypted data on your portable device or even file vault and we'll talk about
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.080]   what to expect at WWDC. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.680]   panel for you as always from the Chicago Sun Times. A lovely and talented
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.360]   Andy and not co in Center Square to Block. Hello Andy.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.360]   Lovely and talented are both subjective terms but I'm glad you decided to
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.880]   apply both. It was very time to be Leo. Of course it's objective and I have good
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.560]   taste just like Bill Gates had Steve Jobs had. We shall get to that and is that
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.880]   okay don't tell me it's a it's a rodent of some sort. It looks like it could be a
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.280]   squirrel but it's the tail is wrong. You're close it is a member of the squirrel
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.800]   family. This is a groundhog. Wow. So yes so this is testing out some long lenses
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.360]   the other day. Puncetani Phil. Yes. Act act actabugger. I was truly 33 years
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.360]   old before I discovered that wood chucks and ground hogs are actually the
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.400]   same thing. Really? I did I'm learning that now and I'm 56 so. Exactly. I only
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.840]   found out there were squirrels like two members of the squirrel family two
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.920]   two weeks ago. Nature. There's always something to surprise you. They're always
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.000]   making up new stuff for you to have to learn. I mean you go you leave you leave
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.880]   high school you think you're done. Stupid scientists. Don't forget to visit the
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.400]   library kids. They don't do that anymore. No kid goes to the library anymore right
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.800]   they got the internet now. Maybe if they need the internet. Well they need they
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.560]   need the internet for for for in-game purchases and while they're there maybe
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.120]   they'll learn something about certain species in their backyard. Also joining
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.040]   us from oh boy Blackberry World. It can't. Blackberry live live live. It's Renee
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.280]   Richie. And I'll explain this. Renee has not got a pastate on us. He is not
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   suddenly switching to the other team but I'm more is a family of sites including
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.840]   crackberry.com. Yeah I have two jobs. I run I'm more but I'm also the producer
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.800]   for Mobile Nations video stuff and we're doing a lot of video while we're at
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.480]   Blackberry live. Ah because you're such a good videographer. No because no one
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.800]   else wanted to do it. Well I want to get the news from Blackberry. I'm very very
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.600]   excited to hear that Blackberry Messenger is finally on iOS. Yeah absolutely it's
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.160]   been an interesting show so far Leo. That was that was irony but that's okay.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.680]   Oh I'm sorry. Maybe sarcasm. I'm not sure about the two but I'll ask Andy
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.040]   because he probably knows the difference. Also joining us from his apartment
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.560]   somewhere in the world Mr. Mike Elgin. Hello Michael. Hello I'm actually in
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.040]   Silicon Valley. Oh so I was going somewhere in the world. I was gonna get
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.760]   you to give me a hint like tell me what time it is. It's 1137 in the morning.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.880]   Wow he must be in Australia. You're in Silicon. What are you doing in a home?
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.400]   Google I/O. Oh you're here for Google I/O. Yeah yeah and and also you know
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.480]   spent a couple of months see family and stuff and we're gonna take off again in
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.920]   August. You are living the life and I'm very jealous for those who don't know
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.280]   Mike decided that because he had was an empty nester and the grant no grandkids
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.240]   yet that now is the time for Mike and his wife to see the world and they lived
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:20.480]   for a while in Africa in in Spain in Greece on Sparta. Where are you gonna go
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.840]   next? You know we're gonna initially go back to Europe because we just didn't
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.920]   get enough and probably France and Portugal and just sort of hit some of
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.640]   those. We originally were gonna avoid Europe because it's very expensive. Not
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.600]   Portugal. We just can't draw ourselves away. We had such a great time in Spain.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.160]   It's not even funny and we just had a fantastic time. It's probably gonna do
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.160]   Europe again. And the euro is a little weaker than it used to be. It's probably
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.680]   not a bad time. Yeah yeah it's great time to be in Europe. Well hello everybody
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.400]   and welcome. We are on the eve. Tomorrow is Google I/O and then in about three
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:03.040]   weeks we've got WWDC. It's that time of year. Apparently developers work in the
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.320]   summer. I guess. But it's that time of year for the developers conference. I guess we
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.880]   could start a little bit with Google I well wait a minute since we've got
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.880]   somebody at Blackberry Live we should really we should get the news from
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.560]   Blackberry Live. I was being facetious about BBM on iOS and Android. It's a
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.120]   little late. I mean do people still using BBM? Yeah I mean they put out a lot of
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.360]   statistics and I think you know they have a huge engagement level. People
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.240]   check their messages very quickly. They send billions of messages every day and a
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.520]   lot of people especially in merging markets they get phones that only have
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.280]   BBM plans. The same they might get a phone like Facebook plan and it is late.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.960]   I mean there's companies like WhatsApp and other companies that have gone into
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.360]   that space and become very popular. But BBM is still for a large group of people
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.040]   the way they communicate every day. So it's nice to see doing it for Android and
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.240]   iOS. No mention a Windows phone. It's nice to see they're actually going across
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.120]   platform for once. It's all surprising. It's as if I mean they could have done
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.600]   this years ago. I guess they did wanted to preserve their monopoly. Yeah well
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.800]   actually Torcen high is the CEO addressed that on the stage and he said that
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.240]   previously they were kind of risk adverse because they didn't have new
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.720]   hardware or a new operating system on the market. So they had to maintain
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.280]   whatever lock-in they could. But now with their new system he said that they're
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.560]   very confident about extending their services to other platforms. By the way
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.520]   I have to apologize because Renee is on Wi-Fi. We're gonna get occasional
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.720]   breakup like that. But I think the sound quality is pretty good so we'll
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.920]   we'll stick with it. What else announced at Blackberry World anything? I mean
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.960]   Blackberry Live we you know we already know about the Z 10 and the Q 10. A new
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.680]   phone? A new phone. Yes the Q5 which is a lower end emerging markets phone. It
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.440]   comes in a bunch of colors like red and pink and black and white and yellow I
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.720]   think and it's very light. It reminds Christina Warren from Mashable said it's
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.680]   like a centro for Blackberry and that's a very apt description. So it looks like a
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.720]   Q 10 but decidedly lower end. That's interesting everybody's making phones for
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.440]   the emerging marketing fact we're just waiting to hear what Apple's gonna do.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.760]   And they also did BBM channels which is their version of Twitter so you can now
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.960]   have someone subscribe to you in BBM and they're creating it for brands and for
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.400]   celebrities and you can follow different people and exchange with them the way
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.640]   you would on any other social network. Yeah because Twitter is such a flop I
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.280]   think it's time really for somebody to move in and do it right. And who better?
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.920]   I think they're really the Blackberry. Their infrastructure is like one of the
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:31.320]   last big things they have collapsed and I think it behooves them to exploit it as
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.800]   much as they can before it's way past two lights. Yeah it's not a good sign when
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.880]   a company starts saying do you know we have a lot of high-end office furniture
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.200]   we have ping pong tables we still have a lot of equity here in the company.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.280]   We shouldn't I'm not gonna make fun well I'm gonna stop making fun anyway of
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.360]   a Blackberry and I wish him well because you know I mean I think this is probably
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.920]   true of many of us that the last smartphone I used before the iPhone came
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.040]   out in 2007 was a Blackberry Blackberry curve that was the smartphone
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.880]   platform that Nokia's the Symbian platform until Apple came along it was
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.440]   really in some ways what Apple was doing was in response to the difficulty
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   using Windows Phone 6.5 Blackberry and Symbian. I really don't know what Eric
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.160]   Schmidt from Google would do without his Blackberry. He still uses a Blackberry.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:36.800]   He does. Yep it's got a really frost lickable. The Android teams nuggets. Yeah
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.560]   I still see them all you still see them all over the place I mean they're
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.280]   still again the fleet vehicle phones that lots lots corporations issued
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.600]   a few. Government still likes Blackberry although you see Samsung making a big
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.760]   deal about its secure platform and safely. Well that didn't release I think
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.080]   Knox got delayed again. Yeah it's been delayed and delayed and delayed. I think
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.360]   though you know the Pentagon just approved Samsung phones and about to
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.720]   provide phones for use in the Pentagon I think that that notion that only
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:12.800]   Blackberry secure is now. Yeah even that it's too late. Well they kind of talk
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.040]   about three levels like they have active sync for the very basic very easy stuff
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.240]   and they have something similar with iOS and Android does for the middle level
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.360]   stuff and they have the super high level you can disable things and basically
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:30.400]   make the phone no fun at all to use no camera and no happening and secure levels.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   That's a great selling point. Make your phone no fun at all. They even have they
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.800]   even have on Blackberry 10 they have a dual mode where you have almost separate
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.520]   logins for personal and work. Backway balance. Yeah have this phone and you can
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:51.000]   actually partition it for both occasions. Isn't that crazy but it makes sense. Yeah
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.160]   for a lot of people it makes sense have two separate phones and that's what
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   Samsung in those ads those famous ads with the unicorn apocalypse were talking
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.760]   about how in the accounting and sales department there was one person who had
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:08.800]   two phones and she said well I have one for home. That's my iPhone and one for
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.040]   work that's my Blackberry. I believe the unicorn apocalypse commercial is a
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.280]   Samsung commercial. What did I say? I think you said Blackberry. Oh I meant
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:23.400]   Samsung for sure. Yeah yeah. So Blackberry will remain a part of the
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.120]   Department of Defense's mobile strategy for the time being but they've
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.680]   starting February next year they're going to open a platform agnostic mobile
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.480]   policy which will allow Android and Apple devices including iPads I presume
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.440]   in the door of that five-sided building. And that was the other last big
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.000]   announcement here is that all the Blackberry management stuff and security
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   stuff is going to work across platform too so they're opening it up to
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.160]   businesses having all those devices and they just want to be your tool to manage
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.680]   them all. That's probably smart that's acknowledging the way it is right. Yeah
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:05.600]   yeah Apple I'm very pleased to say is starting to roll out its two-step
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:12.040]   authentication platform worldwide now. I got to get mine turned on. There's
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.280]   something keeping me from doing it. I have to make a call. I just got mine.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:22.440]   Yeah. How does it work? I think currently it's only still limited to SMS. I just
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.480]   get an SMS message and I have to put that in which is good because if you
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.000]   don't happen to have an iPhone but you have an iPad you can give it any SMS
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.320]   number you want. But I think after a while it's going to work over Apple ID as
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:38.960]   well like find my iPhone. So it only kicks in whenever you want to make
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.640]   purchases or whenever you try to make purchases from a brand new phone or
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.960]   brand new device. So it's not as though I don't believe I haven't turned
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.640]   on myself yet but it's not as though you'll have to key in a pin every time
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.880]   that you want to make a purchase or buy an album. It's like every time it sees a
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.760]   change in your activity that might be correct for somebody who's trying to
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:01.080]   rip you off it'll ask for a pin number first. That's good. So what I'm surprised
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:10.240]   though you guys haven't turned them on yet. I have a turn on because I tried and
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.920]   then there was some there's something blocking me from doing it and I can't
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.200]   lines on. Yeah you turned it on. Okay. Yeah. I turned off Gmail and Dropbox
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.440]   authentication because they were asking me every time and I kept getting in
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.000]   valid tokens and it was so secure. I couldn't get in but so far with the Apple
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.320]   one it's working. Okay. I use it wherever I can including Facebook I do
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.560]   still use Google and you're right. It's a little bit more of a pain but not
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.320]   insurmountable and it's certainly a lot more secure. Where else do I have to
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.800]   step? I have to step on a lot of things. LastPass, Outlook.com, Microsoft's
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:46.320]   added to step verification. I wish Apple would support as those do by the way the
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.200]   Google Authenticator. There is this I didn't know this but there's a standard
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.120]   for two-step identification. It's an open standard and it eliminates its need
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.840]   for a text message you could have an application running that would give you
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.400]   the Authenticator code as well. I don't know if Apple's not using that
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.600]   technology but it is a standard and I love it. Microsoft's using it LastPass
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.960]   uses it. Google uses it. It means we don't have to have multiple different
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.400]   ways. Text message is fine but if you're out of out of the area or something I
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.600]   guess you wouldn't be buying stuff. It's fine as long as your text messaging is
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.400]   reliable. If you started getting them out of order and you send multiple ones and
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.600]   they validate the previous one, would you get the first one? Yeah, I'm gonna have to
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.240]   I think I have to make a call to get mine working so I guess I will. The
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.760]   question is if Apple users are the kind that will really put up with any sort
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.320]   of a two-step verification system that puts any friction between themselves and
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.000]   the goal that they want to get to. I think this is why Apple waited so long
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.280]   to do this sort of thing and why the way they did it was not the Google way
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.960]   which is to keep asking for free to revalidate over and over again but to
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.440]   try to be really careful about when it tries to enforce that. You remember we
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.800]   talked about that article that somewhat misleading article that the feds couldn't
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:12.440]   tap wiretap eye messages. Apparently Apple is deluged by police demands to
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:19.280]   decrypt iPhones according to a document color writing on CNET because the ATF
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.040]   said nobody could unlock a defendant's iPhone. Apple is being asked to do and
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:30.440]   apparently Apple can and they now have a police waiting list. So just a point
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:36.120]   if you think that that passcode locking your iPhone is secure it's not
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:42.840]   because Apple can unlock it which means I mean if Apple can unlock it go
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.600]   ahead. Well no only the we still don't know exactly what means Apple can use to
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.160]   unlock this. It could be that they the article is actually very clear about
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.960]   this that you don't know you don't know whether there's a some sort of a
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.240]   backdoor that Apple knows about but the consumers don't. I don't think that's
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.240]   because I would be incredibly problematic. I don't know whether they we
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.280]   don't know whether they're just simply better at figuring out how to look at
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.040]   forensic clues inside the phone to figure out what that correct passcode is
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.280]   or the encryption how do we how to decrypt it. I don't know. Here's the affidavit
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.120]   from the alcohol from the alcohol tobacco firearms in a Kentucky case quote
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.000]   Apple has the capabilities to bypass the security software and download the
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.920]   contents of the phone to an external memory device. But is it who wrote that
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.120]   was that someone with the technical no-hault? Well the no the difference between
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.520]   bypass and simply no it's the law enforcement I don't know how sophisticated
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.280]   Apple types 0 0 0 0 into your pin code it will unlock your phone. I don't think
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.360]   that's what's it what's it's a client a south segoyan's brother who is a
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   security guy a principal technologist at the ACLU's speech privacy technology
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.480]   product says mobile users should take this as a warning Google and Apple can
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.240]   provide access to data stored on an encrypted device at least in some
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.600]   circumstances. The presumption being it says this
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:07.320]   encryption protected by a passkey but apparently it's not secure. Now Simpson
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:13.880]   Garfinkel another a very smart guy at MIT actually he's an associate professor
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.720]   at the Naval Post graduate school said it's impossible for law enforcement to
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:26.760]   perform forensic examinations of devices seized from criminals. However you can do
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.880]   a brute force attack on it so maybe that's what Apple's doing I don't know
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:36.680]   Elcom soft offers a brute force attack on four digit and and pass codes that they
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.720]   can crack in 20 to 40 minutes if you've got physical access to the phone you
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:45.880]   could do that. Four digits isn't that secure. Yeah and there's really great
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.680]   software for if you have file based protection on all kinds of systems
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.320]   graphics cards have so many so many processors on them that there's there's
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.680]   there's their brute force algorithms that just five years ago people thought
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.080]   that well for two brute force this this six digit password would take about eight
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.960]   kajillion years and now because of the software and the best and consumer
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.640]   hardware you can get that down to weeks if not days which is still too much to
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.880]   try to brute force 10,000 passwords but if you have one guy that you're trying to
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.840]   compromise that's certainly that's certainly reasonable. 10,000 is probably
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.920]   a closer number for the feds in terms of the art of phones are trying to crack I
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.280]   wonder about this because why would the why would the law enforcement various
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.800]   law enforcement agencies wait for Apple why wouldn't I mean if it's brute for
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:39.080]   you know two questions one is is it is it really true that it's almost
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.840]   impossible to for for the feds to get in these things and is it really true that
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:49.640]   Apple has a method for getting in I'm I'm gonna go ahead and go with a working
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.560]   assumption that it's all true because why would law enforcement wait for Apple
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.280]   wait seven weeks or something like that when they're really champing it the bit
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:04.040]   to prosecute someone and and why would they go to Apple I mean Apple's not
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.520]   gonna download some brute force software from somewhere they they I think it's
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.720]   a reasonable possibility that they do have an actual method a backdoor of some
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.880]   kind that allows them in I don't I don't think that's an unreasonable scenario.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:26.440]   Well a security expert this this is way above my my my college education but
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:33.400]   a different expert explained to me this way that there he it's like there's I
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:39.040]   for I forgot my I lost my car keys level encryption I lost the password to my
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.440]   bank account encryption and then there's there is a deranged madman with a
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.000]   nuclear with a backpack nuclear device somewhere in this somewhere in this
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.200]   country in the intense identity within 30 days problem so there's nothing that
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.240]   can't be solved with a big enough with big enough stakes even even even sort of
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.600]   laughed at when I cited a different report from about a year and a half ago
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.840]   about a certain encryption method that was just theoretically uncractably said
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.480]   no if you put enough manpower enough enough for priority on it it could be
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.400]   fixed the problem is that when you have something as if you were to have
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.720]   something as simple as a backdoor or something as simple as if you if you
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.400]   open up this device and get access to the storage directly I mean the actual
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.480]   physical hardware you don't want a situation in which law enforcement could
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:29.240]   get access to this stuff on a hunch or on a or as a shortcut you really have to
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.080]   make it so that the reason why they're sending this phone to apple or saying
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.480]   this phone to google or trying to get access to to private privately held
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.880]   keys is because yes they feel as though it really is that important they have
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.040]   the entire case they now just need this another piece of evidence to collect
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.120]   this thing you can't put them in a position where they think that this is
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.240]   a this is like a this is like one of those red kiosks at the supermarket we
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.240]   insert phone wait two seconds to get data out or else they're gonna be going on
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.920]   fishing expeditions everywhere but yeah it can be done the question is how
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.320]   how involved is the holding corporation gonna be so what you're saying is the
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.160]   local sheriff doesn't have access to NSA to crack down on some drug dealers
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.960]   something like that yeah so you go up exactly but a lot of them there at the
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.760]   at there's a lot of law enforcement tech conferences in which they do there
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.520]   are companies that do sell kits that can and a very quick training program so
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.760]   we'll basically allow almost any medium-sized police force to create to
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.880]   deputize somebody as their official information officer and so there's
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.880]   hardware tools and software tools that can largely automate the process of
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.120]   getting this data off and this mostly this does this does count on the person
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.800]   with the phone not being so careful about keeping their data secure but there
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.040]   are also keys that I haven't seen but have described to me where if somebody
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.320]   if a law enforcement person were to simply casually ask hey can I you
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.520]   guys see look at your phone for a second they can take it back to the
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.480]   take back to their prowler there's a device in their car they could
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.560]   essentially get whatever data they can possibly find off of it and then
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.240]   return to you thinking that really they how much damage could they have done
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.120]   with only five or six minutes which is why the ACLU and other organizations are
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.640]   saying that you know treat your phone as though it is essentially every document
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.800]   every piece of personal information you have they can ask for it but you don't
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.600]   necessarily have to hand it over if they really do need it then they can make
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.400]   it make an official legal demand for it until then you keep that thing in your
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.600]   pocket so it makes me wonder what will change when Apple and if Apple but I
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.920]   think it's more of a when builds fingerprint readers into their phone and
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.360]   hopefully they won't do it in the idiotic way that a lot of Windows laptops
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.880]   have fingerprint reading which is as a convenience mostly people use as an
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.320]   alternative to the password giving hackers two ways to get in instead of one
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:52.680]   hopefully it'll be seriously locked and provide serious positive ID but I
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:58.520]   would imagine that would change things pretty dramatically if if they're you
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.480]   know if all iPhones had biometric authentication hey I do want to talk
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.360]   about that because you wrote a good article that the eye and iPhone is going
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.560]   to be identity so let me boil it and then we'll do that in a second let me
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.320]   boil it down though there's really a simple question which is is Apple
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.520]   brute forcing this and maybe they have better means to do so because they can
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.920]   dump the data off and they have ways to do that because frankly if it's
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.600]   brute forcing I can't believe that the NSA or even a local sheriff's department
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.600]   does not have that technology or does Apple provide a backdoor and if they do
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.680]   then is there a backdoor and file vault as well and if there is that serious
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.960]   cause for concern and there's and I would point out that this is exactly why I
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.840]   always encourage people to use open source encryption technology and not
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.000]   closed source because you can never know with closed source encryption if the
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.840]   data is has if there's a backdoor if the data is accessible to law enforcement
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:24:00.680]   well when this when this story got above the water line recently I tried to sort
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.400]   of update the information that I had the last time I did a deep deep dive into
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:10.480]   into security in the law and again I'm not a cryptologist no nor am I a lawyer
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.040]   but I couldn't find any information to update that that the understanding that
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:20.760]   if Apple were to or Google were to have an official backdoor key that would
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.680]   cause so many problems for them trying to sell this as a secure device for
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.240]   businesses and for the government that would be almost impossible for them to
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.520]   implement it a good reason for them to keep this quiet no if they had that
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.360]   technology they kept it quiet that is serious that's that's that's such bad
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.640]   who do that they I don't think that they would touch it my my my
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.440]   I think Andy that it might be bad who do for business but you know the the
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:50.400]   government wants Skype and other forms of trans of conversation that are not
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.560]   wiretapable to offer back doors and the presumption is a Microsoft as soon as
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.160]   they acquired Skype in fact they'd put a law enforcement backdoor into Skype and
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.000]   they they're not gonna announce that they're not gonna tell the world that in
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.120]   fact they may not even be able to thanks to the pay predict I mean why would they
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.400]   even go to Apple in the first place if Apple isn't doing anything special if
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.240]   they don't have exactly that gives it that's based on their manufacturer of
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.600]   the phone they have a back door what's their involvement at all
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:17.280]   well it does look I will say that most of my trying to figure this thing out is
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.240]   what they what they're legally required to do versus what can they do on their
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.760]   own and time and time again we're finding out that agencies don't need to
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.400]   have the law on their side all they have to do is have a polite and productive
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.320]   relationship with private companies that are already have control of your data
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.640]   however that said if they have a back if they have a back door and then from
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.760]   from what a different consultant was telling me about a contract that manages
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.600]   tens of thousands of devices across very very high secure high transaction
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.520]   individuals if they had a backdoor into whatever security that they're that
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.840]   they're using that would be almost a jail time sort of problem if that were
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.160]   actually discovered no I think you're a no exactly the opposite if they're
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.720]   requiring it we have heard many times that government wants the backdoor in
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.120]   their insisting private companies put the backdoor in they're not but they don't
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.200]   have that legal requirement yet not yet but there's no reason you can't be
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.120]   extra nice to law enforcement and do it ahead of time that's the difference
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.240]   that's not against the law that's the difference between they're required to
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.720]   have a backdoor and they have chosen to put it a backdoor there's there's
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:31.560]   do you think that Skype doesn't have a backdoor I would not doubt that Skype
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:37.600]   has a backdoor so why isn't Microsoft more liable than Apple I'm saying that
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.720]   the scenario that you're out that you're saying that if they're making public
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.760]   statements about the security of their devices and using that to get contracts
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.800]   about how secure their technology is and how secure the data that people
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.360]   entrust in companies and trust for that data is if unbeknownst to the person
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.040]   who makes that purchase or signs that purchase order with that company that
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.320]   there is actually a way for for a third party unbeknownst to them to get access
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.880]   to any data on that device that essentially I don't I'm trying I'm trying
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.440]   not to speculate because again this is way outside me leave these legal areas
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.960]   away outside my expertise and conversations I've had with people about
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:17.080]   this are were broad in nature and not specific but for them to have that
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.560]   backdoor not disclose that they have the ability to request a law
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.320]   enforcement to to access that device openly not simply to try to circumvent
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.040]   stuff but they have a walk through the back door there's a screen there is
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.800]   there's there's an unprotected thermal exhaust port protected by a trench on
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.640]   the on the far side of the battle station that's something they would
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:42.880]   be required to disclose there's also I mean that's a US specific thing but
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.400]   Apple operates in many countries and not all of them have the same legal systems
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.400]   as the US and it's that sort of system existed before stories about other
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.760]   platforms in in other countries like Barry absolutely and they spoke about
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.920]   that today and they said that you know they have to be fault they have to follow
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.120]   the laws of very other varied countries and jurisdictions and the legal
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.240]   processes and if they're served a warrant and it's a valid warrant from a
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.960]   valid court system they have to comply just like any company has to comply so
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.880]   if you have that kind of backdoor I mean what's to stop a country that has
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.880]   very different laws and very different concerns for citizens rights from using
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.960]   it in ways it's not used in the US but we've also heard stories about people
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.400]   getting physical access to your iPhone and jailbreaking it or security flaws
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.080]   that require physical access and it's not hard to believe that you know when a
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.800]   company that makes a phone has physical access to that phone that there's all
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.560]   sorts of things they can pull off even without like a formal backdoor or
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.640]   entry system into it I guess the point would be and Garfinkle points this out
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.440]   if you have a four-character passcode that can be brute forced very quickly if
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:48.000]   you make it longer as you should you can make it difficult to brute force we
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.280]   don't know if it's brute force or if there is in fact a backdoor method but
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.880]   it would be prudent a not to put anything really private on your iPhone and b
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.120]   have at least a 10-digit pin which Garfinkle says with current technology
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.000]   take about 25 years to brute force now to pay in the but to enter a 10-digit pin
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   every time you unlock your phone so my suggestion is don't put anything on the
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.920]   phone you don't want somebody to see because it's not I don't think it's
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:18.600]   private on the phone or on the internet well the internet I just I just I just
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.440]   want to clarify that like I said sometimes it's hard to talk about things
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.080]   where you're getting information second-hand my understanding at least in the
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:32.960]   United States that if if Apple or another or Google or another company that they
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.440]   are not required to unlock a phone for a third for even for law and force that's
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.000]   not like a legal requirement they have to follow it that's more of a voluntary
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.840]   thing but yeah I mean there's their phone numbers and there's data that I will
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.560]   not entrust any digital device and the lot of that reason why personally is
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.280]   because I like to have the answer to the question do you is there any chance that
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.480]   this got that someone hacked your phone and got this I can say no because that
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.600]   has never been on my phone in any way shape or form it's it's all about how
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.480]   what's the worst case scenario of a certain piece of information falling
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.000]   into the wrong hands and in many cases for everybody even if you're not you
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.840]   know cooking meth in your basement there is going to be that data that you
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.880]   don't want to put anywhere I will also point out because everybody the number
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.000]   of people in the chair I'm saying oh no you don't have to worry because there's
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.120]   a remote a race and if you could say it as if somebody tries to unlock it 10
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   times it'll erase I think you could presume that Apple is disabled both the
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.640]   remote a race and the 10-time penalty pretty pretty right away as soon as it
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.400]   gets the phone from law enforcement I would like to I would like to say for the
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.360]   benefit of the Apple engineer and vice president that is using this as an
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.960]   infinite microphone because I've gotten that it's let's let's let's let's have a
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:47.040]   let's have a little self-control here that there's what the problem is that
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.680]   when you have a situation of the unknown yes it's possibly it's true that
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.760]   anything can possibly happen but then you sort of have to click that into that
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.880]   little Lego slot of what piece will fit into what if we're talking about the
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.440]   idea that Apple and Microsoft have free and Google have free and unlimited access
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.840]   to all the data on your phone for any reason that's not true I don't think
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   anybody should doubt that there are gonna be circumstances under which the data
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.760]   on your phone could be compromised triply so if you ever let this out of
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.080]   your possession if for for more than 30 seconds or if it's taken from you by law
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.840]   enforcement or if it's taken from from law enforcement that's why like that's
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   why there are people who do have those who do have that a drill in a circular
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.240]   saw ready to go that before you know they let something out of their hands
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.040]   they you always have the ability to destroy this phone you're not required
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.960]   unless the things have gotten pretty far into the investigation to preserve
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.560]   documentation and preserve events fortunately I'm actually I just don't want
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.040]   people I just don't want the the pull quote from this episode to be Apple has
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.480]   unlimited access to all your data and everything they're telling you about
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.360]   the security of the iPhone is all right it's not not from this episode is from
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.280]   Declan McCullough writing at CNET ATF says no law enforcement could unlock a
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.720]   defendant's phone but Apple can bypass the security software if it chooses this
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.360]   is an affidavit from an ATF agent that says Apple has the capabilities to bypass
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.760]   the security software download the contents of a phone to an external memory
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.160]   device is not made up we're not speculating and then this all comes from
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.160]   an affidavit by a federal law enforcement official to a court exactly what we we
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.360]   need better information but so far that you're not going to get it from Apple or
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.560]   law enforcement in fact ATF said we can't comment but we're also going to get it
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.440]   from people who are as well informed as that ATF agent and probably as almost
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.960]   as well informed as anybody inside of Apple I've been looking around I'm not
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.480]   saying I doubt that I doubt this statement I'm saying that I'm saying I'm saying
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.760]   that I would feel better about the statement if we saw some outside
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.240]   consultants say yes this tracks very nicely with what I know and what I've
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.920]   been told from other people I work in this industry and I haven't been able to
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.480]   find it yet so I'm not saying it's not true I'm just saying that this is now on
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.240]   the level of this is a piece of information that is out there as opposed
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.280]   to a part of the accepted and understood reality of life on planet
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:58.360]   her right yeah I agree with that and I'm sure we'll hear more about it I don't
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.200]   think well I hope we hear more about it the federal government in the US at least
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.520]   seems to have unlimited abilities quash any investigation this hopefully
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.360]   there'll be a Freedom of Information Act yeah you know that's not worth it
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   Foya is redacted you should definitely file that because the United States
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.600]   Postal Service can use the postage that you're gonna be making to mail in that
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:24.200]   request civic duty by stance way to keep that Saturday delivery coming in I
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.520]   think there's a backdoor and I think that's distressing but I think you should
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.920]   assume it in every case unless you're using open source encryption I have
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.480]   heard that they don't have a lot of access to your stuff even people who
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.960]   work in those areas have no access to your stuff so I have nothing definitive but
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.880]   I've heard that you know they just can't go get your data yeah except but we have
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:48.160]   this affidavit from a guy who you know an active case who says they do why do
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.920]   you think you think he's wrong I don't know the process whereby some guy can
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.720]   just walk up to the phone press a button and get one in this different well I
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.440]   don't know exactly what it means no he says only Apple can do it and Apple
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:02.520]   can but but but but but that's a different issue of whether anybody in
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.640]   the departments of various departments of Apple that that we can talk to can get
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:12.080]   access of course they can't but whether Apple has a small group somewhere that
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:18.200]   or some some some method where they specifically respond to requests from
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.080]   law enforcement is it is an unknown question at this point but it even if
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.560]   that were the case it wouldn't be the case that just any random person in Apple
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.280]   would be able to access stuff that's entirely different issue I'm sure they
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.160]   would be much more responsible yeah than that yeah but I mean I think the point
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.080]   would be if anybody at Apple could do that that you should presume that your
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:45.160]   data is not protected that's all that's that's true in general I just
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.920]   true in general I don't even I've got some data that's that's very very
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.720]   solid encrypted but even though even there I don't pretend as though this
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.280]   would never ever come out I mean it's it's not information about where I've
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.840]   buried bodies you know I do for the record I don't bury body
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.960]   the computers come and you're in a lot of trouble well and I got to say if
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.840]   you're putting something really super private on a device that you carry
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:12.280]   around in your in your back pocket you're trying to the interesting person as
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.840]   it is yeah I personally have no valuable information of any kind that I can
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.760]   think of and anything that is private is kind of I don't store it in a file on
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.840]   my phone I have it in the cloud and and I try to protect that but I did who what
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.880]   what data are people carrying around on the phone I think it's mostly about
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.640]   messaging communication and ultimately financial issues and you know we have
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.040]   to worry about you know identity theft and all that kind of stuff as well yeah
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.720]   and really what law enforcement wants from a phone is not a super encrypted
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.680]   file that listing all my crimes but and merely the phone numbers I call where
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.240]   I've been location data location data all of which they can get very simply
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:53.720]   with a pen register they don't even need the phone so I mean it's it's probably
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.320]   the case that this isn't that important it's just something to be aware of you
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.600]   know and it is and it is interesting that this is the same discussion that
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   we've been having ever since encryption started never since law enforcement
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.280]   very reasonably I had their reaction to personal data encryption which is that
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:14.320]   our will there will there ever be a federal law passed that in so in so many
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.640]   words says that you do not have the right to store information in such a way that
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.040]   the government cannot read it if they want to fortunately so far the
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.280]   discussion I don't think it's ever really gonna end fortunately the courts
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.480]   have so far upheld our right to have that stuff private absolutely there
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.440]   there there have been there have been times when law enforcement have tried to
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:37.040]   put in provisions into various internet technology internet related
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.760]   legislation information related legislation that says that law enforcement
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.960]   shall have has shall have freedom of access to a certain data stream or a
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:50.000]   certain product and that's never gone in right that's never gotten as soon as
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.920]   that that gets exposed the light of day it becomes such a politically dangerous
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.680]   thing to support that if this thing dies what I'm more concerned about
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.520]   companies like Apple and ISPs voluntarily offering that as a feature
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.040]   just because they want to be nice to law enforcement and that that seems to be
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.200]   the case that I mean certainly ISPs remember carnivore the FBI box it was
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:15.720]   preserved 18 months of your internet access never did manage to make it into
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:21.120]   law but ISPs quite happily installed it but I you know I that's uncomfortable
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.320]   also but because it turns Apple and Google into the Supreme Court deciding
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.600]   what's constitutional what is unconstitutional on you know it's it's a
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.920]   really difficult problem for that reason exactly if if the companies have the
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:40.280]   access and are deciding whether or not to grant access to specific requests
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:45.600]   which in fact is the case right now then these companies have enormous power
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:51.720]   over how information and privacy and law enforcement works that we don't
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.120]   necessarily want them to have I want to talk to you Mike in a second about your
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.920]   Google+ article I guess it was in computer world on the iPhone and why the
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.920]   eye and the next iPhone might mean identity I think I've talked we've
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.280]   mentioned it on a number of shows yes yes now we get to talk to you and find
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.160]   out why you think this might even be I chimed in at the time and you couldn't
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:17.000]   hear me talk back why are you talking about our show today brought to you by
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.480]   those great folks at smile software we just love them they're great supporters
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.720]   of the Macintosh community community they make great software and there is a
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:33.200]   new version of PDF pen out PDF pen six for the Macintosh you can now export PDFs
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.360]   to Microsoft Word format it's got a new editing bar a great new design I just
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:43.240]   love PDF pen I've used it for years anytime I have a PDF and you know my
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   sons of freshman in college now are going to be a freshman see you in the
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.600]   fall and of course that means what a lot of forms to fill out I gave him I said
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:57.440]   Henry here's PDF pen here's the PDFs start filling them out it's great by the
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.800]   way it looks great on a retina display they've optimized it for retina you can
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.240]   drag you can create a library of signatures initials and that's what we
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.560]   have is you know Henry's signature we scanned it in his initials we scanned
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.920]   that in it of course you can fill out text feels it even will automatically do
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.480]   a form fill in for you which is fabulous I think you're gonna like it it is the
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.560]   PDF editing and annotating application and very affordable PDF pen you can get
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.520]   it in the app store I would suggest going to smile software and getting a
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.120]   demo version of it first it's always nice when they offer demos one thing the
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:36.240]   app store will not do but you can do it smile software calm slash Mac break
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:43.240]   smile software dot com slash Mac break they also have it for the iPad it's a
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:49.440]   wonderful useful tool I use I mean so often it seems like this and I'm actually
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.320]   thrilled faxes are kind of dying out finally and people are sending PDFs
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.040]   often they say print because most people don't know what to do with it print
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:03.920]   this out fill it in scan it and email it I skip all that printed out fill it in
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.880]   scan it stuff I just use PDF pen I can do it all very quickly very easily on the
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.520]   computer looks great and satisfies everybody I can even export to word which
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:18.440]   is really nice try it today PDF pen is available to new sick version 6 for
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:26.160]   free trial at smile software dot com slash Mac break back we come to Mac
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.640]   break weekly with Mike Elgin who's back at Silicon Valley for Google IO then
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:34.840]   back out into the wild wild world around us from Blackberry World it's I'm
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:40.120]   more as Renee Richie where is Blackberry World today it is in Orlando beautiful
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:44.880]   Florida and is yes is it what is this what is the kind of the the spirit of
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.400]   people there are they a little bit like or are they excited I think they're
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.840]   mostly defiant almost like with web west was on the ropes and other there's
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:58.160]   people who are just hardcore fans and they see this as their second maybe last
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:05.120]   chance good also with this from the Chicago Sun times Mr. Andy in not co and
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.120]   that's great to have all three of you at one of the things I love is that we
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:16.280]   can have these really good informed discussions with you guys and and maybe
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.000]   not get to the bottom of this we won't get to the bottom of it until Apple or
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.240]   somebody steps forward but at least we can really talk about the ramifications
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:29.680]   and what it means and I just love that so thank you I phone now the reason you
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.320]   said this Mike is because of the rumors that the next iPhone will have a
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:39.760]   fingerprint reader well Apple acquired the world's leading maker of fingerprint
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:45.720]   readers and they have been kind of holding back on their digital wallet
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:51.920]   solution it's it's sort of a hobby at this point I would I would say and
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:57.960]   simultaneously the problem of identity is the single biggest problem now this
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.800]   isn't a problem that users think a lot about or care a lot about but this is the
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.920]   big problem in Silicon Valley Eric Schmidt said that Google+ was created not as a
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.360]   social network but as an identity platform Omala said that Facebook's
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:17.400]   whole purpose is to provide an identity and this is why the social networks have
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.000]   required real names they tried to require it it doesn't really work at some point
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.480]   Facebook was even telling people they need to take pictures or scan their
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:30.480]   passports and driver's license and they're desperate everybody's desperate to
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.000]   have their service be identity in other words an electronic entity that is
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.440]   essentially you with a photo ID in a signature that kind of authentication and
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.680]   once you have that identity service if this is a trillion dollar opportunity for
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.280]   whoever can nail it and nobody can nail it because nobody can get people to give
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:54.960]   up their fingerprints or can get people to really do what's necessary to have
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:00.360]   real identification so I think Apple is the one company can do this this is
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:05.440]   Apple was the company their core competency is the ability to change user
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.560]   behavior they got us all using touch screens and online on-screen keyboards
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.840]   nobody else could do that they did it once they did it everybody did it and so
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.080]   this is what Apple's really really good at they take this huge opportunity where
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.680]   the experience is awful for the user and where it's a big problem and where if
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.640]   that problem was solved a whole bunch of other things would be awesome so here's
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.560]   what they I think they're gonna do they're gonna I think they're gonna combine
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:37.360]   fingerprint authentication on the phone with wireless technologies like Bluetooth
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:44.360]   4.0 and and especially NFC and they're gonna use that as a an easy pass to
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.040]   almost every side on the Internet so you could so imagine a phone with those
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:52.640]   components in it and a really well encrypted system where you scan your
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.840]   thumb right at that moment and within the next few minutes you set it down
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:01.040]   next to your keyboard there's a there's another NFC chip in the keyboard and
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.200]   that's you that's you on the Internet that's you logging into the computer you
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:10.040]   go to it's like logging in your Apple ID you go to Amazon or whatever and you
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.160]   just buy stuff you never end a credit card it knows your address all that
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:19.440]   stuff because it's it's positive ID that that is you and ultimately I think it
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.640]   could be used as you know for security badges and all this other stuff and Apple
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.440]   is the company that can do it because if Apple builds if Apple replaces the
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:35.200]   passcode on iPhones with a biometric ID they're gonna have dozens of millions or
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.840]   hundreds of millions of users using their biometric security within a pretty
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:47.880]   short period of time I mean you know it's clear that in terms of not merely you
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.760]   know social networks but money that identities everything everything I've
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.880]   mentioned this before that that really credit card transactions check transactions
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.920]   any financial transaction the fundamental problem that needs to be solved and I
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.480]   didn't make this up I was told this by a guy who's become a guru and this is
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:10.960]   identify you identify me and once we can reasonably seriously effectively
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.800]   identify each other than any kind of transaction is you know friction free
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.880]   it's the identification that's tough but Renee is there any evidence at all I
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.920]   mean you're the iPhone rumor guy any evidence at all that this is going to
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.920]   happen and it's certainly not in the next iPhone no the next iPhone the last I
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:32.400]   heard it's still gonna be an iPhone 5S type device where it's the same body and
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.880]   the same general design and that restricts kind of new technology that
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:41.080]   go into it but Mike's absolutely right they bought authentic and not cheap either
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.480]   320 some million dollars I mean and Apple's very careful say that they don't
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.080]   always make obvious use of the stuff they buy they often pivot them in new
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.400]   directions or you use the the people there to do new things but it is a problem
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.960]   that needs to be solved Apple has this stuff so if it's an iPhone 6 thing or an
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.760]   iPhone 7 thing you know hopefully not that long it does stand to reason I just
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:05.320]   haven't heard anything but anything convincing of it yet I also wonder
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:10.400]   because iPhones are no or not even half of the smartphone universe nowadays if
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.680]   Apple has the market cloud to do this I know what you're saying Mike that Apple's
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.240]   the person to do this but I wonder I mean maybe yes they were but I don't know
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.720]   if they still are aren't they losing market share isn't it in the US I mean
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:28.320]   isn't it this every time they do a big thing and the big things in the past 13
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:34.520]   years have been the iPod the iPhone the iPad and you know you might even say
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.960]   the MacBook Air or something like that but whenever they do a gigantic thing
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.480]   like that what they do and what they're really good at is creating markets right
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:45.880]   not not inventing the technology but creating the market other there were
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.840]   there were touch phones there were touchscreen phones multi touch phones
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:53.440]   before the iPhone came out and nobody cared nobody paid any attention Apple
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   did it and from that point forward every phone except blackberries had
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.640]   touch screens eventually a lot of blackberries do too so so that's what they
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.960]   do so as soon as Apple does this and standardizes it then then that will
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:12.840]   become a widespread behavior in Android phones and all these other phones Apple's
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.800]   the company that's in a position to really start these kind of things one
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.440]   thing that also to Mike's point is that even with small things like IPS displays
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.600]   most companies don't buy a lot of displays but Apple was able to get them
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.840]   cheaply because they put them in every single iMac and while there's not a huge
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.200]   market share for Mac putting it across every single iMac is a huge order for
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.720]   the components it's a huge standard and it lets a lot of companies start making
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.320]   these things cheaper eventually and if Apple were to put it in every iPhone
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.920]   even though iPhones aren't a majority would be such a large segment of phones
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.640]   that suddenly all had them that it does have the ability to shift markets and to
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.040]   create trends I do think there's maybe issues with NFC security and maybe
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.360]   with getting authentication to work in a way that's easy enough we know our
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:58.280]   parents are our siblings are our kids to use it but the idea itself I think is
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:05.320]   something that Apple could really push forward I think it's more I'll be
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.960]   honest a little bit of a pipe dream Mike well I would love to see it realize
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.040]   when muted oh yeah Andy's been talking this whole time I haven't heard it
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.160]   I'm sorry no no no I'm sorry just I needed to adjust I need to make an
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.040]   adjustment here that's like I'm muted during the commercial and he's
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:25.640]   uncharacteristically so than this is everyone ignoring me no no no I was
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.960]   more like me say I don't know and then you keep talking okay that's fine it's
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:34.120]   good it's good what do you think I think that Apple might have lost some of its
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.760]   chops and how to support how to build something that every other piece of
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.960]   hardware can use because they've gotten really good at building an operating
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.840]   system that works on the hardware that they build that runs the software that
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.400]   they build that connects to the service that they build they're not quite so
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:52.280]   they might have lost touch with what's required to build a technology that can
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.720]   be deployed onto multiple platforms and among multiple legacy devices yeah
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:01.280]   I'm not saying they're gonna do that I'm saying that they're gonna start a
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.840]   they're gonna get the behavior they're gonna get the users they're gonna turn
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.400]   it into a thing and then other people will do their own version of that I
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.720]   am not saying Apple's gonna go across platform with this well I'm it's what
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:18.000]   when they bought authentic real what I was thinking of was yes payments like
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.800]   that but also something as simple as iPad put a little dot on the back of it and
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.640]   when I hand this to my son the son picks it up the he touches the dot on it and
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:33.440]   becomes his iPad just as easily as just as easy as easily as a flogging out and
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.920]   logging in again same thing for multi-user computers it's a really good way for
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:41.920]   one device to be shared among multiple people that's something that Apple could
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.640]   really control immediately the problem the only the only the only view go ahead
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:51.160]   I'm sorry I'm just gonna say that the iPads are never gonna have the numbers of
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.880]   iPhones and they're not gonna have the mobility everybody always has their phone
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.480]   on them at all times and and there are hundreds of millions of iPhones I think
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:04.520]   it makes incredible sense to put fingerprint reading on a phone and almost
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:12.480]   no sense to put it on a tablet except well for square maybe I'd like the POS like
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:16.880]   point of sale not piece of you put the reader on on the on the iPad to make it
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.320]   a better did you see that nice by the way you're gonna see square everywhere all
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.000]   of a sudden it's the iPad stand that square made an ounce today with a card
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.880]   reader in front of it is beautiful and I could just see I just see cash register
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:33.280]   if I were in the national cash register company I'd be worried well what do you
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.360]   need a cash register for anymore and it was but the point the reason I bring
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.400]   this up is that's fully electronic you need a cash register for cash but but
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.880]   we're moving rapidly to a cashless ecosystem are we and this and for that
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:52.520]   we need identification it's it's I mean if we're looking two years out maybe
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.120]   three years out I definitely can see that happening it's just that there's
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:01.280]   so much more we get it's it's it's it's verifying your identity and that's
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.760]   incredibly useful within the sphere of this one device when you start to get
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.200]   trying to get other companies and other websites and other entities to trust
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.960]   that Apple's gonna have to be a lot more open about how they deploy it they're
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.640]   gonna have to make sure that it's absolutely damn foolproof they're gonna
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.680]   have to make sure that it also doesn't really compromise the design of the
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:23.640]   device I'm sure they could figure that out so I'm more foolproof than
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:28.880]   passwords how hard is that it's yeah the current situation is totally
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.160]   unacceptable it's pretty bad it doesn't have to be perfect it just has to be
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:38.760]   acceptable well except well yeah but I think I'm gonna have trouble
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:43.240]   articulating this in the next 38 minutes but it's the great thing about
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:48.360]   passwords is that every website if there's there's no technology that locks
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.840]   that up there's no requirement that someone has to license this to make that
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:58.280]   work on their own service or anything else and if fingerprint tech if fingerprint
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:02.400]   identity becomes something that I can use on my iPhone to make it easier for me
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.720]   to access the stuff that's inside my own passbook that'll work great if it
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   makes it easier for instead of having to to type in an 8-digit pin every time
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.720]   that I want to use the phone I simply pick it up that's a good win that's it
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.200]   that's a good use that technology but if it becomes sort of when I'm doing
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.400]   something that requires some sort of a password some sort of a login now instead
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:29.200]   of having login using Google Twitter Facebook open open ID and others and
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.320]   there's a ninth logo saying your Apple fingerprint authentication that's not
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.120]   necessarily an easier way to do that considering that a lot of these services
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:40.800]   I don't even want to be kind of I don't want my this this tumblr blog that I'm
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.560]   posting a comment on to be connected to my Facebook I don't want Facebook to be
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.280]   exposed that information I don't want that be anywhere in the hands of this
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.080]   other company so I'm saying it's I think it's a more complicated problem that
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.160]   anybody who isn't developing this inside of Apple right now really
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:59.600]   understands yeah so I think I think I think I make a really good point and
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.840]   and the bigger point is that there's a larger world it involves interaction
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.800]   with the larger world not just it's not just happening on your phone but I
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.800]   think that the first step into making into making that process happen and
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.320]   making the world accept this is for everybody to be carrying around this
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.320]   phone so Apple could totally do this and I would love them to we knew we need I
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.400]   would love to see is a meeting of the virtual five families that says that this
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.840]   is a big point of friction that we need a way to solve this and that we can
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.920]   simply all agree that here is going to be the the the the the i's and how our
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:35.440]   interstate highway system for identity identity verification and any way you
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:39.480]   want to you can put a car onto this highway system that's fine so long as
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.280]   it is no wider than this so long as the bridges can handle this sort of traffic
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:47.880]   and so that if Apple if Apple wants to use a fingerprint system that works 100%
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.760]   of the time and Samsung wants to use an eye tracking mechanism that works 58% of
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.840]   the time it works during the during the on stage demo that's fine for them I
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.800]   think it's it's kind of it's going to be difficult when you have a system where
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.800]   you Apple creates this wonderful standard and now everybody else has to
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.280]   figure out whether they want to support it or whether that's the right works
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.080]   or not I think we talked about this we're talking about past book one of the
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.880]   brilliant things about the the past book as it exists right now is that it's so
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:18.400]   easy for any point of sale terminal to to support scanning a code all you need
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.680]   is if you got a web camera of a sufficient resolution you got it it's
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.920]   done it's locked and then there's easy way QR codes are easy enough to read it's
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.880]   not something that's you need to it's not something that belongs to any one
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:34.000]   company or any one platform it's a it's a very easy easy pill to swallow so it's
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.960]   I certainly can't imagine when I say I can't imagine how that will play out in the
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:44.240]   next two years that only means that I have to be humble in the in the
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.640]   humble in the in at the foot of a great mountain that I still have yet to climb
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:53.040]   yeah we're to take a break when we come back I want to talk about big changes coming to Apple
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:59.520]   Care this fall and is this a good thing or a bad thing but first a word from our friends at
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:04.960]   Citrix who do that great program we love so very much go to meeting I can't pretend I love meetings
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:11.600]   it's kind of one of the the bains of my existence at tech TV but I have to acknowledge
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:17.760]   there's something about getting all the parties together in one spot and saying let's solve this
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:23.520]   now let's let's break through the clutter let's get the job done and go to meeting makes these
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.840]   meetings as I know they're necessary makes them as painless as possible makes them as
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.560]   effective as possible and it's especially important if you work in an environment and I think many of
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:37.920]   us do where your clients or your colleagues are in other parts of the country or the world
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:44.240]   you've got multiple offices go to meeting solves so many problems because basically makes meetings
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:50.240]   more effective you share the screen so you are literally on the same page but you also have this
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:55.760]   HD faces technology which makes this is if you spent thousands of dollars actually in many cases
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:01.200]   hundreds of thousands of dollars on a video conferencing suite I you have my deepest sympathies
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:07.920]   because this is so great works so much better and it's one low flat monthly rate and you can
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:14.160]   meet on anything on a desktop on a laptop it works on mobile devices you can even present a
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:18.960]   meeting from your iPad you could attend a meeting on your iPhone you turn on that webcam on your
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:24.400]   iPad and suddenly they see you you see them you're seeing their screen it is very effective I know
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:29.200]   teams that keep go to meeting running all day it's like working side by side even if you're in
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.520]   different parts of the country and the advantage of doing that is with go to meeting one low
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:40.480]   monthly rate flat fee means you don't have to you don't have to you know pay by the hour of the

[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:43.520]   and Mike Elgin who's back at Silicon Valley you're getting excited about Google iO mic tomorrow
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:48.800]   very very excited and right now I'm actually on an all Google diet for the month of May I saw that
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:55.520]   in fact you wrote and you Jeff Jarvis immediately brought it up how great the pixel is that's your
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.480]   that's your notebook of choice these days yes well no no it isn't it's it's what i'm using during
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:05.600]   the trial so i'm still trying to reserve judgment on this and i'm directly and deliberately
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:11.840]   contrasting it against using a macbook or or or or another apple device so i want to
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.960]   talk about what it's like to go for an apple fanboy to go all google not only google hardware but
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:22.720]   google software and google services to best uh to the degree that is possible i had to i wouldn't
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:29.440]   have any hair left tear my hair out kill me i'm i'm really excited about the possibility of
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:35.040]   google now in chrome uh on that is exciting now you can try it now right can't you because
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:42.000]   the chromium which is the beta channel has it uh is that true yes i'll have to download chromium
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.680]   does it well i have the chromium is is what's on the pixel right so i should be able to do it on
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:55.360]   the no no so i have to go me on o s 10 oh i see i see no i think isn't that weird i think the code
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:59:02.240]   is in there but i i don't think you can actually use it um uh i saw the chromium cone hints at it
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:09.760]   but i also saw maybe i saw the wrong thing somebody said that it's now in chromium and you can try it
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:15.280]   maybe i'm wrong maybe i'm mistaken on that yeah but but in any way google now is is an awesome feature
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:20.720]   in addition to being on an all google diet for this month um a couple of days ago i decided to go on
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:27.120]   and to refine it and go on a google now diet uh and and i have a long list of things that i
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:33.280]   only allow myself to use google now for things like launching apps on the on an android phone
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:38.160]   uh and all this stuff so that's weird long story google now to launch oh you use the speech
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:43.040]   recognition speech recognition i'm using it uh for everything you can use it for it a lot of people
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:48.640]   do open up google now and wait for cards to come in i'm trying to use it uh proactively launching
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:53.680]   youtube videos playing music you can just say play and name the song and it'll play it uh
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:58.960]   without touching the phone stuff like that and so uh the point is that i've been really
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:04.160]   familiarizing myself with google now and i've become such a huge fan of google now this is a
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:10.160]   fantastic thing and when this hits the apple sphere forget about it i mean and i'm on the desktop
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:16.080]   it's already on on the iphone in a limited fashion but this is really really a threat to apple i
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:22.000]   think because once you really get hooked into into google now it's really a compelling thing
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.360]   you're right i'm just checking that article i misunderstood it i was reading an article in the
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:31.600]   next web that said the notification center has been ported to chromium mac as kind of the beginning
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.800]   of what would need be needed for a google now would have to be a notification i would be
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:42.000]   surprised if they don't announce it yeah tomorrow yeah tomorrow yeah tomorrow
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.520]   yeah um it's gonna be awesome it's a very interesting thing now i'm still using a windows 8 laptop
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:55.200]   right now because i'm just waiting because i know at the wwdc in june that apple will announce
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:01.760]   haswell based macbooks i'm hoping that a retina air i know that that's a pie pie pipe dream but uh
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:07.120]   even if it's not a retina air i just want new i want haswell based air is better battery life
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:12.080]   so that's what i'm holding off on if they if they if they ship a retina air i'm that's going to be
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.480]   my main machine that's what i mean that that's like that's like it's such a killer product yeah
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.360]   okay get ready for this what about they won't do this i know they won't do this they might as this
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.400]   is like having a fingerprint reader and iphone it's just a pipe dream what about a touch screen retina
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:33.440]   air like your pixel apple won't do that i know they won't but what if yeah wouldn't that be awesome i
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:39.040]   i i i touch my macbook pro the time and nothing happens i know it's driving me crazy it'd be cool
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.040]   if it if that happened if something happened when i touched it other than embarrassment i think apple
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:49.840]   could do this why not because that's not how they roll man so also always 10 is not touch optimized
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:56.000]   in any way she performed and now i then it's not microsoft i strong well they're just throwing
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.080]   spaghetti against the wall i mean i think i think that you could i mean you know i'm using touch on
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.480]   desktop apps on windows 8 that aren't really optimized but you could still you know i mean
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.160]   you could add a few hooks it wouldn't be so hard it's just a mouse except it's not a mouse it's your
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.240]   finger i don't think they're better than nothing but that's not how apple rolls they they are gonna
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.280]   they're when they want you to use a computer in a certain way that's the only way you can use
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.000]   that computer i know that's the difference between apple and windows and others but i'm a really
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.360]   firm believer and i i don't think anybody believes in it more than i do of the future of desktop
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:35.840]   computing is touch i think that the the i don't i'm sorry go ahead now i was going to say i think
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.920]   that apple is going to comfortably skip over touch and go board over his natural language and
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.080]   gesture more like connect-based gestures you don't have to physically touch the screen but you'll get
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.240]   the same effect of touch using a variety of other technologies i think i think it'll be all the above
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:54.640]   i think that the i'm at the future is a is a drafting is a is a giant screen the 31 41 inches
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.160]   set at a drafting table angle with voice uh commands and voice recognition with touch you can put your
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.680]   keyboard on the top it'll recognize stuff that you put on the surface and this isn't anything we're
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.760]   gonna see in the next three years but i think it's almost inevitable that this is where it's gonna
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.480]   go that we're gonna have that the future of the desktop is gonna be a lot more like a giant i
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.880]   pad and not less like a uh you know an apple too and that's what killed windows eight ladies and
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.000]   gentlemen right now i i i i agree i agree i agree with you completely mike i mean that i've set up
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   for as we get another generation a whole generation of people whose first computing experience was to
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.800]   tap a screen it's gonna get more and more important as these people get into their teens at the early
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:38.480]   20s that a desktop has to have touch controller else it's just gonna look like a command line
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.880]   DOS-based interface it's just not gonna work we have to realize that the the wimp user interface
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:50.320]   windows icons trash cans all that stuff is 35 years old wow it's ancient but it works you know
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.000]   isn't it conceivable that something is just so good that it doesn't need to be changed i know we
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.160]   live in a world where change is at a premium but i just feel like sometimes something so good why
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:06.720]   change it okay but here's the thing i'm doing is that is is is rightness to human the human uh mind
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:12.720]   and the and our what we are as human beings as animals that's what makes something good
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.440]   touch the ability to reach out and touch something directly is something human beings have been doing
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.280]   since since the beginning of time using this this funky contraption that that you move it over here
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.240]   and something changes over there that is that is never going to be as good as touching something
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.320]   directly and i think i think it's and that for that reason we're going to move toward touch because
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.760]   that's how human the human brain works i mean i think if you look at it apple didn't add wimp
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:42.880]   interfaces to apple too they made the mac and you know they didn't add multi touch to the mac they
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.480]   made ios and they don't let you go back they don't put arrow keys on you know the apple on the mac
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.720]   they don't put the mouse pointer on on multi touch and it's not hard to see that apple you know
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:59.760]   probably wouldn't retrofit or try to graft multi touch into os 10 but where they go in the next two
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:04.480]   years of the next three years will be that product that uh takes you the next level the same way the
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:09.120]   mac did to the apple too yeah and into the into the comment about i mean the the
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:15.760]   when i say oh well they got this so perfect the first time out that they never had to change it
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.400]   that's how perfect the first iteration of this is that's always like sarcasm and that's always
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:25.600]   the other half launch up i mean i mean true wimp is not the first we're not in the first iteration
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:32.160]   of wimp true we're true art we're the last one it's the the the the situation we're in though now is
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:38.800]   that every new technology is is a response to the times that it was crafted in or at least the times
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:44.560]   the three years previously before all the engineering got worked out uh and so the interface of the
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:51.920]   iPhone is from 2007 it reflects the reality that the engineers knew in 2007 the windows mouse
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:58.880]   interface is a reflection of 1984 1985 1986 it's had refinements but we haven't had that sort of
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:04.960]   real big aha moment on how to make this interface it works so great on a tablet works so great in a
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:09.840]   phone and translate that to make something that's relevant it makes makes great sense on a desktop
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:15.440]   too so i don't think there's going to be a need to i don't i don't think that the users are demanding
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:20.240]   a revolution but the next system that's going to really knock everybody on its butt is the is the
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:25.520]   company that can really fuse all those interests today we need our first obama uh uh
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:30.160]   obama age interface and we don't really have that yet i respectfully
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.640]   not disagree but i would change it a little bit i think you're implying that interfaces are like
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.960]   design that there's fashions and there's times and you have the interface that's right for the time
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.760]   i would think that it's more at more like an evolution what we're trying to get to is the
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:51.840]   ultimate in a natural interface yes we're trying to get to the point where the barrier between us and
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:56.240]   the computer is eliminated and it does you know it kind of that's why google now is cool because it
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:00.800]   kind of knows ahead of time what we want to know and i think interfaces are moving in that direction
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:04.960]   touch is better than mouse because it's more direct speech might be better than touch
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.720]   for some things because it's more natural aren't we moving towards more natural interactions isn't
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:16.000]   that what we the end game that's that's part of it but uh i think the more sophisticated
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.320]   look at this is that remember how we used to use computers back in 1984 and even before then
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.240]   it was sort of you had a whole section of the house that was that you had the computer in the
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.480]   monitoring your keyboard and the chair and the printer set up it was sort of a grand thing that
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:35.760]   you made plans for you even put on a special smoking jacket and fez it was such a formal thing
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.320]   and now a computer is something you dip into for five seconds or you sit down for three hours or
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.640]   you spend a weekend cracking out a problem or you do something in line where you're waiting for
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:52.240]   waiting for uh waiting to uh uh star trek to uh this weekend uh we need and that is how people are
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.360]   interacting with their computers that's how they learn how to do it it's not always about
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.600]   a three-hour project and sitting down and really focusing sometimes it really is about
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.160]   walking in and wanting to get that one one piece of information before you walk back out again
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:09.360]   and natural speech is one way to do that but also touches a way to do that i've i've said for
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.440]   years and years and years but one of my dream desktop computers is a screen that's always on
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.440]   and even want to figure out that okay he's not in the room right now and he's not really paying it
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.680]   my i don't see my camera says that there's no one looking at me right now so i'm going to
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.280]   adjust the screen so that if someone does glance in my direction i can give them information that
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.360]   will cause them to either recognize that they don't need to come and sit down at the computer
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.520]   or that they need there to come here right away and find out what the situation is so those the
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.520]   sort of changes of uh of interface that i think we're going to see this is one of the reasons why
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:43.600]   i'm such i have such affection for uh the microsoft modern interface because it really is an articulation
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.880]   of that thing that uh years and years and years ago i really saw as something i personally would
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.720]   love to see again a screen that gives you information even when you're not really dipping into
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.560]   uh the the the time suck of sitting at a computer the irony i just want jarvis like ironman is that
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:04.080]   microsoft has this pixel sense product which is just breathtakingly awesome and they also
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.520]   acquired perceptive pixel which was the leading uh maker of the you know the wall size computers
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.360]   but here's the and i'm and i'm sorry uh rene i i know you have something good to say i just
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:21.760]   wanted to get in one one perspective for how to look at user interface user interface design from
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.440]   the beginning of time has always been about the application of gains made through moor's law to
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.000]   making the computer work harder to communicate with the user in the beginning you wrote code and
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.720]   the results came back in code then you you know punch cards and then you got the results and it
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.920]   was like and and the human was working really really hard to communicate or come really hard
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.520]   in this relationship and then we got command line and then we got gooey and the next phase is the
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.920]   reason the next phase is going to be touching voice and so on is that's how human beings operate
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:58.000]   this idea that that um he talked about and about be able to you know the ad hoc usage is the quick
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.160]   and dirty uh usage of computers well that's how human beings interact with other human beings
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.920]   we just chit chat with people you say someone who say something you get an answer back and and
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.960]   that's that's what we are as humans and as we go into the future it'll work harder and harder and
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.080]   harder for us so that it behaves like another human because we're hardwired to interact with other
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.160]   humans not with machines and so that's really all you can that's how you can predict where it's
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.720]   all going the computer is going to work really hard to interact with us in the way that other
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.840]   human beings do i grant you andy that there is some style in the sense that we use computers
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.880]   differently than we used to so when you say the fez in the smoking jacket while i do
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:41.840]   like to wear my fez in smoking jacket during the show uh because the last cut though you know it's
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:47.760]   at the cleaners you change with the time it actually wouldn't want to be seen on camera without
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.480]   nascar on leo but it is true that a mobile device requires a completely different kind of interaction
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.600]   than a desktop device so in that sense it is trend driven as well because we're using devices
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.000]   differently we're using computing differently i do think though that ultimately it has to be
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.320]   the more fluid the more natural the interaction that's why i'm waiting i don't want google glass i
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.720]   want an optic nerve implant right i was gonna say like i just want to watch ironman three and the
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.360]   way he talks to jarvis is my ideal of computer you talk to it it makes holographs around you hold
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.560]   your arm out your arm comes flying and wraps around your body that's you know we've been adding layers
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.040]   of computing like mike said he had the punch cards and you had the command line on a mac today if
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.360]   you're a real eunuchic geek you can launch up terminal or you can use the aqua buoy or you can use
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:33.600]   gestures on the new mouse and we're adding these layers to it now there's dictation
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.480]   and different people of different ages apple has been doing this not just apple people have been
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.640]   doing this next level march towards greater and greater accessibility punch cards were really hard
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.680]   for non-computer geeks to use terminals really hard every time we add a layer to the interface
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.080]   we're making them easier and more accessible and it's not hard to imagine that the next big leap in
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.480]   in interface is going to be to make them even more accessible to even more people people for whom
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:01.040]   even multitouch maybe is a challenge and that includes voice and that includes the computer
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.800]   looking at you and not just listening to you i think that's what makes companies like apple so
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:10.800]   interesting is that relentless drive to get to those more mainstream markets another big change
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:15.840]   we go ahead and remember the first week you use an ipad yeah and you could tell if somebody oh it's
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.760]   a great it's it's far less power than your laptop and it doesn't have a keyboard and it's really
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.240]   great and people kind of want huh but then you used it you're like oh i really get this i really
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:29.840]   understand it and part of that was the subtle psychology of physics and touch that you have to
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:35.920]   experience to to really understand and google now is like that the using google now as heavily as i
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.760]   have in the last few days has really given me that same ipad experience because i'm i'm talking
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.800]   to this thing and and it's doing things for me and it's it's a lit it's it's tapping into something
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:52.080]   very innately human where you know you talk to people and they do things or they respond and give
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.240]   you information and answer your questions so it's it's really voice is going to be a huge part of
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.320]   that and that's a very very natural interface and it's just obviously going to get better and better
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:09.040]   with increased compute power and better software i uh yeah we'll see i like google now and i think
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.240]   when you if the good news is ios people can now finally use it on uh if you have google search and
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.880]   you've updated it you'll have google now it's not the same as it is on android because you have to
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.360]   be running the application on android it's just there it's a bit of a battery drain on ios still
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:29.520]   they need to fix that yeah um but i but i think that what it's what's really interesting to me is that
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.760]   people on the surface might think now is creepy right because what's google's doing is watching your
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.400]   email watching all your searches and then and then watching where you are watching what you're doing
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.120]   and then coming up with cards on google now that reflect what it thinks you're going to do next
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.240]   oh i see you're at the store you probably want to know how long it's going to take to get home and
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:50.800]   shows you the the commute and the traffic those things education it's good education because it's
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:55.600]   it's harvesting that information already yeah it feels like it feels like on the surface it might
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.160]   be creepy and yet when universally when people use it they don't go creepy they go this is great
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.400]   i mean it can't it can be it can be creepy but all that has to happen is it's a little bit like when
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.960]   an actor that you can never imagine in a role it gets cast in a role about a movie that you're
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:17.600]   really looking forward to like okay baz lerman directing the great gatsby exactly but but if it but
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.560]   if the first experience with that is positive you forget all about that when google the first time
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.560]   that you open up a google now screen you take it you take an android phone out of your pocket
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:30.720]   because oh that's right uh where was that where was that restaurant i'm headed to i remember i
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:35.680]   googled it i did a search for it back at home three hours ago and you take your phone out of your
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.160]   pocket intending for you to just do another search for it and oh it's right there that because it
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.840]   remembers what my search history and look here's a map on how to get there from here
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:48.560]   all right then i guess i was i was very correct in giving my personal and personal
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.160]   assistant information about what i planned to do today yeah it's smart it's actually smart of
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.360]   google but i just it it trusts your kids to people all right enough right and you're worried about like
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:02.320]   oh no no google knows what i certainly address i searched for come on yeah come on yeah i never
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.880]   trusted my kids to people but that's another story entire you go hey did you see gatsby
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:14.640]   i saw i saw the trailer i know i'm terrified here's here's here's i'm not going to judge
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:21.440]   except i haven't seen it i'm but here's here is my mindset i truly want to reread the book from
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:25.520]   start to finish again first right before i see it yes not because i'm going to be comparing but
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:29.840]   because i don't want if it's it's actually been like about eight months since i've read it and i
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:36.880]   don't want like any of those visuals to get replaced by you know a a def leopard song no no it's worse
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:43.120]   it's jz with cg i with your jeez oh god yeah i think nothing says the jazz age like hip-hop yeah
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.920]   yeah but i i'm gonna i'm gonna go with an open mind but you're right you probably should reread
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.960]   the great gatsby you should definitely read enders game somebody just tweeted me because i had said
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:56.880]   don't go see the movie until you've read the novel if you because one of or the other's going to be a
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:02.560]   spoiler let the novel let orson scarred cards immortal sci-fi novel be the spoiler don't let the
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:09.360]   movie spoil a great novel uh so wisdom and somebody tweeted me i just listened to enders game just
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:16.720]   finished it on audible you are so right so just just uh uh uh just a word warning i say i i'm i'm
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.360]   he bas lemond hired a lot of people a lot of people worked and were able to feed their families
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:28.480]   because and for that reason i'm glad that that movie got made yeah but i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.280]   yeah so sort of a wpa administration very timely for for the for the time of the novel i will i
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:42.000]   i will i will say that if you can like go on youtube and look up bill knack n a c k oh and great gatsby
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.840]   he's a sports legendary sports writer and absolute book lover and he loves that book so much that
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.160]   he didn't memorize the last scenes of the book he just happens to be able to be able to recite it
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:57.760]   for memory and there's a video of he's he's also he's also was also a really really good long time
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:03.520]   friend of roger ebert so there's a video of him shot shot by roger ebert reciting the end of the
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:09.200]   great gatsby and if bas leerman could do something as 10 percent as good as bill knack reciting the
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.360]   ending of the great gatsby then he will have achieved something very very that's really the
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:18.160]   thing about the great gatsby uh is that you know it's when you make a movie it's about the story
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.400]   it's about the ideas the characters and all that kind of stuff and it has a intriguing story and
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:28.720]   and good characters and all that stuff but what makes the great gatsby so great is the language
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:34.240]   for for people who are word nerds and and and language uh boughs they're they're literally probably
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:41.360]   isn't a better written book in the american uh history of american literature it's it's a truly
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:48.000]   fantastic book you you you get a third of the way through it and by movie standards certainly by
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.400]   bas leerman movie standards nothing has happened yet it's all about tone and scene setting and just
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.680]   the language and how you get there and it's like i'm i'm not sure that you can do this in five second
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:06.880]   jump cuts of hbo or someone had uh that was bas leerman's uh William shakespeare's roe
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:13.520]   marlion juliet on and i i never seen it before and i'd seen like a bit of it from later on and i
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.880]   happen to catch it just like right before is gonna start so i'm like hey great i haven't seen this
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:22.560]   before i'll start from the beginning and i honest to god six minutes in i had to turn it off because
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:28.160]   it was just doing things to my neurochemistry that i did not approve of nothing good it was just
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:34.400]   it's just oh you're just shouting all of your dialogue and you put these unnecessary explosions
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:43.280]   in and oh again again and i'll take any explosions and shakespeare's roe hired a lot of actors
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.840]   hired a lot of lighting guys sound sound engineers yeah again i'm glad they all get
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.000]   picked up paid it so i'm gonna go see i'm gonna go see gatsby i want to see it but uh but uh
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.200]   i'm not i'm gonna separate it in my mind from the book and by the way this is the only podcast in the
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.720]   entire twit network where i could say the words great gatsby and we get a 15 minute conversation
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:07.280]   i'm literally merits of the great gatsby and i like it i like it i like it
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:13.040]   break weekly next week jj abraham's bale wolf we'll talk about it uh big changes coming to apple
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.920]   care the town hall on thursday apple according this according to apple insider informed tech staff
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:24.800]   that uh starting this fall warranty subscriptions on apple care
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:34.240]   uh the way we were this is a real bummer uh the way the biggest announcement according to an apple
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:39.840]   employee who is not identified uh was the way repairs for iphones will be handled the way it is
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.720]   now if almost anything's wrong with an iphone ipod or ipad and you go in and you've got apple care
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:52.320]   we give you a brand new one or a like new remanufactured device now we're starting to actually repair
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:59.200]   the products and return the same device to the customer um that's not so bad you know uh i
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:04.880]   uh routinely bring in my iphone when the screen breaks not mine my kids when the screen breaks and
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.600]   you know get a new glass piece put on it not by apple but by a company you know a guy in the town
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:16.160]   who does that uh so that's not necessarily bad uh apple care will become a subscription model or
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:22.000]   maybe they're going to introduce a new subscription tier it'll be tied to you not your products now
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.360]   this is kind of interesting especially for those of us who buy a lot of apple stuff it's the first
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:33.280]   part Leo um that's not entirely new i mean that's more a function of the iphone five design the iphone
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:37.680]   three and three gs were like that it was very easy to take them apart and change components
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.840]   because of the way the four and the four s were made it was really hard right but i think we reported
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.680]   right when the iphone five was introduced to be part of the because of the way that it was put
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.920]   together it was going to make in-store repairs uh easy again and it was just a matter of getting
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.800]   the equipment into the individual stores now that what's happened that's interesting so you wouldn't
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.160]   look at the iphone five and think gee this looks easier than the four s to repair but it is
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.560]   it depends which parts are glued to which other parts and what parts are removed when you take
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:14.800]   the device apart right um i'm i'm very intrigued by uh this uh new um apple care uh the new apple
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.480]   care may include and this is again all kind of you know a little sketch because it's
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:25.840]   it's not exactly rumors it's leaks from an at town hall um apple insider says the new apple
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:34.640]   care may also include exclusive 24/7 support pricing unknown um under the proposed system
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:40.560]   a customer is entitled to in-store training uh like that one-to-one program which i think is
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:44.640]   fabulous when you buy a new mac you can go in before the store opens nine in the morning and get
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:51.360]   one-to-one training from a genius um do you what what are your sources tell you on this rene is
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.360]   that all accurate uh i don't know i've heard that they're doing a lot of changes to apple
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:00.160]   retail but i haven't heard anything specific about this and also until they i mean i
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.680]   things like this are programs that are being proposed and they can be rolled out or not rolled
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:10.800]   out right then is it wrong or is it the plans just change right lots more tutorials uh they're
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:15.360]   going to have a home advisor team currently i didn't know this there are over 4200 technical
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:20.960]   advisors who work from their homes and they're going to and that number doubled in the last year
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.560]   and it's going to increase again and the idea is you've got people there at home
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:29.360]   they're trained you call them you don't call them in their house but you but when you call apple
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:35.360]   you get them they're at home in india yeah well maybe yeah i mean that that's the beauty of it is
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.240]   you can be anywhere that's people not just the best people who are in town exactly um
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:46.160]   instead of a universal swap out fee you know it's like if you if your i-phone it's 200 i think
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:52.240]   it's 200 for a i-phone swap out if you have apple care uh now they can fix it per device
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:59.440]   they have deployed advanced in-store repair tools and parts at select locations so they're
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.960]   already doing that i get a little queasy when when i when i read about innovation that involves
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:10.080]   saving money yeah because i want i want apple to be i want apple to continue its
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:17.600]   general assault on the universe and not start retreating into cost savings i don't think that's
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.560]   what this is about really but what's really exciting about this is that if i know apple what
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:28.800]   they're going to do is changes like this will reflect changes in how they design their products
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.200]   so if they have this policy where geniuses are always going to be fixing fine iPhones i think
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.880]   they're going to probably have to make iPhones easier to fix or quicker to fix or something like
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:42.720]   that right so this could this could be a harbinger of good things is that possible harbinger is a
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:47.200]   negative thing but this could this could suggest design changes in the future that would make
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.040]   uh harbinger could be positive aren't aren't red robins the harbinger of spring
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:58.480]   i don't know we'll have to look at ours this week in language it'll be a plague of success
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:05.840]   now that's negative um in any event i'd like to see that happen with their their laptops and
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:10.640]   the macbook air to make those more repairable in the future because this this cluing everything
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:15.200]   together yeah let me go in the opposite way yeah i think they're i'mac is basically the macbook
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.680]   air of desktop computers at this point i don't i don't know if that's changing anytime soon yeah
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:27.360]   uh you might want to watch at cbs news some unaired footage with bill gates talking about his last
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:33.120]   visit with steve jobs it's on the web page but they didn't put it on uh on the 60 minutes interview
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:39.440]   with charlie rose um when asked what the pair talked about during their final meeting at the
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:47.760]   jobs home may 2011 gates welled up saying what we learned families anything he said uh steve and
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.240]   i practically grew up together it's true and he said we were watching each other constantly with
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.920]   interest not necessarily publicly but we always look i was always paying attention what he was
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:03.040]   doing he was always paying attention um he was not being melancholy like oh i've been jib
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:07.600]   jib'd said bill gates it was very forward looking like oh we really haven't improved
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.240]   education with technology yet what do you think is i think that's typical of steve not thinking
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.640]   gosh you know my life took a terrible turn but really what thinking about the future
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:23.360]   one of the most emotional moments of that uh comment by gates is that he said that steve
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.080]   jobs showed him his boat yeah talked about how great it's going to be to be out on the boat even
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.960]   though they both know that wasn't going to happen never did yeah but the eternal optimist
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:38.480]   uh steve i i think i bet you steve believed he was going to lick the cancer even to the very end
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.200]   uh a single act of will yeah by will yeah we'll power alone
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:53.280]   um i should refer people to uh rene's i'm more article time for touch screens max hell no
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.720]   that's uh yeah that's that peter cohen peter wrote that oh you hired peter that's right
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.960]   yeah absolutely yeah that's salty that's a salty uh peter cohenism isn't it hell no

[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:35.360]   let's see if this window is going to actually move um my actual pick of the week kind of
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:42.240]   crashed on me on the most egregious way possible uh this morning and forcing me to scramble to
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:46.880]   find another pick of the week oh i'm going to all i i didn't know whether it was my fault or
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:52.720]   whether it was just really really badly written software it could yet again my ability to discover
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:57.600]   new ways to make something break uh is justly famous throughout this galaxy so i'm not going
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:02.080]   to blame the piece of stuff that piece of software just yet so instead i'm going to
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:06.000]   recommend something that i've been using for years i think i've been if i i picked this before
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.880]   would have been two and a half three years ago it's from photomatics it's excuse me it's from a
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:17.440]   company called hdr soft is called photomatics essentials uh what it's uh it's an hdr program
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:22.160]   it's really the only one that i've ever encountered that i really really like uh a lot of people are
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:27.360]   familiar with what hdr is about it's where you take like a there there's some photos that are
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.840]   almost impossible to get like this was at the boss at the bus in public library where i wanted
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:36.080]   i wanted to get yeah i wish you see the whole thing i like the reflection though of the window in the
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:40.880]   lens exactly and and impossible to get because like you're getting all this light from the from the
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:45.840]   window you can either expose for the for the window or you can expose for the clock but that's really
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:51.200]   you have you choose one of the other uh hdr lets you essentially take a series of exposures
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:55.840]   from light to dark and then the software will combine them all together to give you a very very
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:00.720]   high range of tones inside the same inside the same thing there are a bunch of different apps that
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:07.760]   let you do that even the iphone has an hdr mode but usually especially in the desktop they'll give you
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:17.200]   a really fakie looking just special effects like a cgi like the bad cgi 1997 version of what you
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:24.880]   what you saw there in the room uh whereas photomatics it will give you when you just drag the uh the
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:30.880]   selection of uh of images uh onto onto the app it will line them up to make sure that they all line
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.360]   up with each other so we'll get no blurry edges and then it will give you start off by giving you
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:39.280]   like here are nine different ways i could combine these together into one exposure so if you want
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:43.600]   the sort of video game fakie looking version it'll give you that but if you want something that looks
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:49.280]   like a natural photo as though you really did come in there with a big big like the eight thousand
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:53.920]   dollars worth of lights so you could light the inside properly to match the outside lighting it
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:58.240]   will let you do that too so that's why i like it let's give that give you that sort of like natural
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:03.200]   natural effect and i use it all the time even even if you don't actually buy this software it's such
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:08.240]   a great idea to know how your bracketing feature works on the camera we just hold on the button
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:12.640]   on the exposure button and we'll just continue to click off frames at different exposures because
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.360]   even if you don't have the software if you have it a week later a year later two years later you'll
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:23.200]   have the the the stock that you need in order to combine those into a good uh really nicely toned
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.920]   image and photomax they could they have a ninety nine dollar version of it that's sort of uh
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.400]   that gives you really every bell mostly you can possibly want but for the basic function of i
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:37.760]   just want to be able to to take these frames and merge them into a beautiful looking photo they
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:42.800]   also have photomatics essentials it goes for just 40 bucks works with just about any photo app you
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:49.040]   have up there uh so like i said a bit bit impromptu pick but certainly worthy of another mention because
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:53.040]   again so many times when i really i really do wish that i had twenty thousand dollars i could spend
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.920]   on photographic equipment i really do wish that you know when i'm going to boston just for like a
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:03.440]   lunch meeting that i could just bring my entire huge you know hockey bag style bag full equipment
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:08.080]   with me but no instead i i will have just my phone with me or i will just have my my pocket
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:12.960]   panasonic camera with me uh and if i know that if i take us if i can't get the shot that i want with
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:17.760]   one frame if i just take a bracketed series of exposures photomatics in turn into something very very close
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:23.040]   to what i want if not exactly what i want i love it i use it too works well with Photoshop and Lightroom
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:27.520]   and that's part of my workflow tray rack clip introduced me to photomatics and i agree it's
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:32.400]   just a bit of isn't it it is it's like it's almost like panorama software where it's like you start
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:36.960]   we start walking into space and thinking ooh i bet this would make a good panorama stitch you know what
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:42.720]   i like is uh the way you use it because a lot of times you you see hd or you know it's hd or you're
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:47.440]   looking at it's go yeah yeah it looks like a painting but what you did is you made that you
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:52.880]   so what you made what you saw in that picture work with with the limited dynamic range of a real
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:56.160]   camera so you could see the reflection in the window at the same time and it's just beautiful
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.920]   and you would never look at that say oh that's got well maybe a probe might oh that's got to be an
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:04.720]   hdr that's gorgeous yeah i mean i like to i like to use it for because the the reason why hdr is
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.200]   necessary is that the human eye has a much wider dynamic range than the image sensor on even an
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:15.440]   expensive camera and so hdr can be used to really duplicate what what what you're actually seeing
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:20.560]   in that room uh because you get you just you're in there you take that snapshot you're disappointed
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.640]   because oh the window there's not there's no detail in the windows he changed the exposure like
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:28.960]   okay and i can see through the window but oh now they four rounds too dark it just lets you get
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:36.560]   what you really came to get i agree beautiful stuff thank you any anaco photomatics uh let's get
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:43.120]   a mike yelgan pick here all right well um i've been uh on this google diet and i've discovered that
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:48.560]   there are some aspects of using google products on ios that are better than on android and one of
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:54.960]   them is checking in and doing things around uh location the the on on the android platform it's
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:00.560]   all lumped into the maps application located everything is in there and it's kind of an annoying way to
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:07.840]   do it on on ios you have a separate uh latitude app and so i i recommend using the the latitude app
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:15.840]   uh for check-ins and it also uh recommended using google plus because it does some latitude and
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:22.160]   google plus work really nicely together so if you can go to my profile in google plus um leo
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.600]   on the screen i'll show you a really neat trick that happens here so first of all unlike um four
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:34.080]   square and stuff the default mode for check-ins uh on latitude to google plus is that it doesn't
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:39.600]   spam your circle so people who are who are following me on google plus don't get my check-ins
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.720]   they actually would have to go to my profile to see my check-in and that's the right way to do
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.880]   it it's kind of passively there it doesn't so i've circled you but i didn't see this check in at
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.000]   joey coffee and tea until i actually went to your profile that's exactly right and that's i like
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.560]   that sure that's wonderful i want to check in and for people who really care i also have
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:03.600]   latitude set up so that my my fam my immediate family is notified and so they can see where i
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:09.360]   am exactly if you look at my google plus stream when i look at it it's all check-ins all the time
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.840]   right it's really but i don't know if i've made those i don't know if i've made those public or not
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:19.840]   yeah so if you if you if you hover over it should hopefully this will work if you hover over the um
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:28.000]   the location um in my profile see the big picture at the top of my profile yeah it's a big uh
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.880]   photosphere if you hover over currently in cambal california oh yeah the whole thing changed to a
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:39.440]   map oh look at that oh that is sweet it's a really nice feature that hardly anything knows about
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.640]   but this is really great when i'm traveling i'm i'm in i'm in really awesome location that i like
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.520]   to brag about this it will show up as a map yeah in this case it's probably not worth bragging about
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:55.200]   you just off california's nice but he's right next to the dollar tree though you might want to
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.680]   get him to pick up something on the way home of the fighting cougars yeah exactly so that's my
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:05.120]   recommendation that is you check-ins without spamming people it's a particularly good experience
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:10.160]   with latitude on ios it's just a standalone app that you download it's free of course and you can
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:16.080]   set it up so that it it gives you the benefits of check-ins without all the irritants google maps on
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:23.200]   androids of course has it built into maps yeah um and then did you have to do something to make it
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.600]   public because right now my check-ins i didn't want to spam people right right right so i made my
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.560]   check-ins private so you make a public yeah you you go in on the settings and you can do a default
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:36.720]   and then you can change it for individual or i could say which circles it's like family circle
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:44.080]   exactly on the ios app though that that whole process is much better and clearer and easier
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.320]   so i really like i really like the standalone app approach rather than it's buried in the maps
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:55.280]   app somewhere approach yeah and how does it so i'm i never understood on ios do you have to periodically
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.560]   launch the app or did you just kind of always running in the background how does it do that
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:04.080]   you know i think if you close the app there's just no nothing going on at all and that you have to
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:08.880]   specifically check in and so your check-in is sort of registered on the system for a while and then
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:14.160]   it forgets and you vanish so for example this transformation of my profile picture to a map
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:20.240]   that'll just sort of if if it won't actually check in after a while that'll just go away
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:25.440]   well i have it for instance i have it set up to automatically check in at certain places like here
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:32.800]   yeah uh and i just sent you a sharing request for uh uh i only do it with friends because i don't
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:39.280]   want everybody to know where my house is right exactly but uh Robert scoble does yeah
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:45.600]   maybe that was a mistake i actually was eating at a restaurant in pet at petaluma once and scoble
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:51.040]   shows up and i said oh what a coincidence he says no no i tracked you nice yeah
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:55.680]   fortunately he was wearing clothes google glass told me you were having a bagel
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.120]   i like that i think that's uh that's nice and i love this new feature so i'm gonna but it's right
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.520]   now it's only available to people to like a half a dozen people do they have to be latitude
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:12.960]   users or can you share it to a circle uh which feature are you talking about this this ability to
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:19.120]   highlight to hover over my profile and see where i am oh no that's uh that's for everybody uh everybody
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:25.200]   can do that okay that works for everybody and it's interesting by far the most interesting
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.760]   implementation of that and and google did a special behind the scenes project is the uh that
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.960]   canadian astronaut who's in the space station uh he's actually now home chris had he's now home
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.480]   yeah but but he was his map would reflect the location of the space
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:47.200]   he is the coolest human alive great singer too that space oddity we played it yeah sunny on twit
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:53.440]   unbelievable yep what a talent i would don't but wouldn't wouldn't you think that there would
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:59.040]   there'd be some sort of like error checking code that says okay this guy says that he's gone around
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:05.200]   the world five times and one day clearly gps is free not on the phone i he probably has a friend
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:12.160]   at google he's he's literally two miles from the gps satellite this camera that he's yeah that can't
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:18.400]   go for just check exactly just he can't he can do that with nfc just he taps his phone on the satellite
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:25.920]   awfully strong signal oh my god he's in the house all right uh very nice very nice thank you mike
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:31.680]   elgin i agree let's play with latitude let's let everybody know exactly where we are
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:37.840]   rene richie is in orlando florida you got to pick for us rene i do it's the story of a man is
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:43.200]   beard and his new application um for a while now wait a minute wait a minute when you say a man in
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.560]   a beard that jim dallerable leaps to mind absolutely i mean i jim dallerable he used to work at mac
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:53.360]   world he currently runs loop insight the loop uh and for a while now i've been complaining that he
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.640]   doesn't do enough long-form stuff because he mostly does curated link list content so every time i
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.640]   spoke to him i would complain and he would just tell me to shut up but the last time i complained
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.760]   he said just wait just wait a little bit and then i got the beta for an application and it launched
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:14.880]   late last week and it's the loop magazine yeah so what this is is uh it's very similar to marco
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.640]   armman's magazine and jim you know he didn't rip it off he did talk to marco about it before he
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:24.800]   launched it but it is basically the long-form content from the loop uh that i have been wanting
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.360]   and i've been waiting for it jim does the introduction hubert coen does an article on gaming matt gimbal
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:35.760]   does an article on interface um and i like that you know it's publishing is made very easy now on
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:40.320]   ios new stand as a terrific job and we get the opportunity to have all these great writers do
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:44.560]   these longer more in-depth sometimes more thoughtful pieces and we get all these
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.600]   additional voices because the loop magazine has a very different flavor to it than marco armman's
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:55.040]   magazine and i'm sure more of these will spring up both from established publishers and people who
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.440]   just want to be entrepreneurs and publish something that they like you know jim very famously likes
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:04.800]   apple stuff he likes web stuff and he likes guitars and theater likes gaming um and it's going to be a
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:11.200]   very unique blend of a periodical and i this kind of stuff i find highly interesting and i found the
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:19.040]   first issue of the loop to be really great read very cool how much is it it's 199 it's the same
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:23.440]   formula as the magazine so basically you substitute the first issues i think free for seven days
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:30.560]   any subscribe for 199 a month and that gives you two issues i'm going to make a recommendation
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:36.080]   that i made before but i'm going to make it in spades now because they've just updated the phillips
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:42.080]   hue lighting uh this morning i got up and i got a update for my base and it is getting more and
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:48.160]   more intriguing this is led lighting not cheap the base station plus your first three bulbs 199
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.560]   lists and then 60 bucks list per additional bulb but remember these are led bulbs they'll last
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:58.240]   long forever basically they also sip at energy so i think in the long run it's probably a push
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:03.360]   but what you can do with you in the past you've been able to use your iphone or android phone to
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:10.080]   control the lights to even take pictures and take the hues like i'm in grease and i want the light
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.000]   was so amazing in grease actually take a picture and make the lights because there are gb
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.200]   actually that color they have reading they've relaxation they have concentration settings
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:24.800]   now they'll recognize that you're home talk about location mic geofencing your lights will
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:30.640]   automatically turn on a change settings as you arrive home i love that hues says it's like a happy
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:36.080]   puppy welcoming you at the front door only without the slobber uh plus as you walk out the
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:41.600]   front door guess what the lights turn themselves off you got to love that uh there is recurring
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:48.720]   alarms so you can have you slowly ramp up every morning at seven a.m first its sunrise then it's
