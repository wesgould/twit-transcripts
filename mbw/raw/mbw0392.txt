[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Joining us in the studio once again, Alex Lindsey, making it a trifecta of Lindsey Goodness.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Trifecta. Welcome back.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It's going to be here. Nice to have you.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   You really, you said you weren't going to travel as much, but I didn't believe it.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   You didn't believe it. Well, I might be traveling soon again for a little bit, but, uh...
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah, no, I've been settling in a little bit.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I have somebody sitting next to me.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Of course, Andy Inako is no slouch either.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   His monitor is sitting next to me. That's good.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   From the Chicago Sun Times. Welcome, Andy.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Thank you, Leo. And Alex, again, we are...
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Our hearts have been broken so many times.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   We didn't dare to believe that you'd be here week after week after week.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And soon it'll be like, "When will he ever leave?"
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Alex, don't you have a road trip? You need to get to.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Don't you have to go somewhere there, but you don't have a connection?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I want to thank Alex, because you saved the day on Sunday as...
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Oh, it was great.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Terry Kay's point now. We had trouble, Skype trouble with Film Girl.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I think Christina Warren really wanted to go watch the Oscars,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   because she tweeted quite a bit from the Oscars.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   There you go.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   But somehow Skype got in the nose.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Christina wanted to be here, but thank you for filling in.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I had a great time.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I had a great time.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I had a great time.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And then finally, Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMOR.com
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   and Mobile Nations. Good to see you, Renee.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Thank you, Leo. Good to see you, too.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Renee, you look better every week.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Oh, thank you.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   He's breaking my trail.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   The system keeps on refining.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Is it spring yet in Montreal?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   No, it's spring break, which means we're all down by the frozen river in our thermal speedos, trying to enjoy ourselves.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Only three layers.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Jimmy Fallon, where did he do the polar bear dip?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Chicago.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Chicago.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It was actually the first spontaneous expression he's had on television since he took over the tonight.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Well, he did wear a suit, which was a little odd.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I don't think that's going to keep you warm and icy water.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Well, it's a punk move because you might be wearing like a wet suit underneath it.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You've got to go shirtless like the guy to his left.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   That guy is the pro.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   That guy is the pro from Dover.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And Rahm Emanuel is somewhere in there, the mayor of Chicago.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   See, he was wearing shorts.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Shorts and a t-shirt, I believe.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Uh-huh, see?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Suit, you're right.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I bet you he has a wet suit.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He has nothing to hide for politician.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Nothing to hide.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Jimmy Fallon, he's got that sort of, you know, that sort of, you know, I don't know, that sort of squirrely look about him that says that I bet that I'm wearing like a polar suit underneath it.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   He could be Green Lantern under there.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It looks like there could be shrinkage going on.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's pretty, he looks pretty chilled.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   You're right, because he's not that good an actor either.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I thought Taxi.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He was in Taxi?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Oh, yeah, he was Taxi.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Jimmy Fallon.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I appreciate that with Queen Latifah, who could be watching anybody else?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   What taxi are you talking about?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I don't think he's talking about the show.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   He's talking about the movie.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I'm sorry, the movie where?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Not Taxi.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I'm thinking Robert De Niro and Taxi Driver.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You're not talking about that.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I wasn't even thinking about that.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I was thinking, Taxi, the movie.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   The T-Fancy.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's basically part of the part of the, the exit, the sort of halfway house process.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   When you stop being a sarinet live male cast member, you have to do one movie in which you play like sort of an image of the movie.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   You play like sort of an immature cop.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   This was his transitional, sort of mainstream of back in a society where people are going to be judging him more on his merits as opposed to being able to be sort of mildly amusing for two and a half minutes one week at a time, 20 weeks out of the year.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Wow.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It's less startling.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's less frightening for them.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   If we can get more of these former SNL cast members out there, they might actually reproduce and not require such warehousing on network television.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And so that's, that's really the goal.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I mean, it's nice that they, we're allowing these, these comedians to survive, but we haven't done our job as caretakers of planet Earth until we've allowed the native population of somewhat funny sketch comedians to reestablish their populations.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Making NBC cry.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   There you go.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Officer Washburn is having a bad day.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Oh, that's always funny when the year back goes off later.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I was hard to recognize him because he's not giggling and looking into the camera appropriately.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   You don't like Jimmy Fallon, do you?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Well, I'm not overly impressed by him.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Again, I respect him.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I respect people who, who are pleased by him.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I have sampled the new Tonight Show.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   It is not a product that I can use in my professional or personal life.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   He's very likable.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   He's a sweet likable boy.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   He's likable as hell, but it's, it's not, it's, it's, do you, do you want someone who's likable or do you want someone who's funny?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Okay.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And there you go.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I just, I just don't get it.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   That's, that's all.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   You can throw it.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Step on it.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   You jumped in the right way.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Again, I, I've sat with the-
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   When do we cover the Mac news on this show?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Is that, is that soon?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Is that coming up?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   He does, he does have a Mac on his desktop.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Okay, there you go.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   He does have Josh on the show where I haven't watched in a while, but he used to have Josh
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   and Paul's, he, he, on the show a lot.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I'm sure that he will get to Josh and John.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Two, two points very much in his favor.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.920]   Again, I'm not, I'm merely saying that as a consumer of late night product, he does not
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   create a product that I have a use for.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.920]   When does, when does Robert De Niro and Jody Foster, when do they show up in this?
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   Is that later?
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   You talking to me?
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.920]   So Remake is talking to me.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   He's playing with the Peter Boyle role.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.920]   We got, we got to get someone else.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.920]   He's talking to me as Travis Pickle, but as opposed to like the other guys who hangs
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   out the taxi stands.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   Well, we cut just at the right time, by the way, on that, on that trailer.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.920]   Wow.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   Wow.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.920]   There was some brief sensuality.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   I just want to tell you.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   All right.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.320]   Let me give you a couple of updates.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.920]   First of all, Ellen uses an iPhone.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   Okay.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.920]   That's very important.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   They should all understand this.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   Oops.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   They best selling iPhone app or it's possible that Ellen, Ellen's people use an iPhone.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   No, I think it's Ellen.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.920]   Ellen uses an iPhone.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.680]   So very, you know, maybe it's just maybe a side effect of the business that we're in because
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.920]   whenever I see product placement, it's like, why is Roger Rabbit?
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920]   No, immediately.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.080]   Now, what they claim is that it was not part of the product placement.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.080]   It wasn't Samsung.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.200]   It wasn't part of Samsung's deal to get them to take up use it in the show.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   The producers thought it would be fun to use in the show and they use Samsung obviously
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.320]   because they were already a sponsor, but according to the producers for the show, they
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.560]   were like, Samsung didn't know it.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.600]   They were just like, well, okay, let me tell you what the Wall Street Journal says.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.560]   The Wall Street Journal says that first of all, Samsung bought five minutes of ad time
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.600]   on the Oscar ceremony and which is why they used it.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.480]   It's estimated at $1.8 million a for 30 seconds.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.960]   We're talking a good 20 million just change compared to what they got out of this one
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   selfie.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.760]   According to the Wall Street Journal, Ellen wanted decided she wanted to do selfies during
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760]   the show.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:53.200]   ABC said you might want to use a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 since they just spent $20 million
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.440]   for five minutes of ad time.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.360]   It was probably more, I would guess more as many experts say more impactful than the commercials
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   themselves.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   Absolutely.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.560]   You can't miss that big white pleather.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.920]   The big Samsung logo and a stick leather.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.480]   It's part of the corporate branding.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.280]   Only one phone manufacturer will make a phone that's that tacky.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.720]   I mean, had it been almost any other phone, you wouldn't know it was a Galaxy Note, but
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.880]   that phone.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:26.480]   I mean, the only one phone maker saw the Mac OS 10.7 redesign of the eye calendar application
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.560]   said, you know what?
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   We do like the fake stitching.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.920]   As a matter of fact, we like to put that on a real product.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.920]   Take leather is underutilized in our market.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.840]   But also the size is kind of a giveaway.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.320]   They're thinking it's a monster.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.280]   So the first selfie she took was all blurry and yucky.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.840]   She goes like this.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.000]   Thank goodness Bradley Cooper took over.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   That's all I can say.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.560]   If you watch it, the whole lot of she wants to have somebody else do it.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.320]   And Bradley, let me just have it.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.880]   And we will now turn it to like you think any of those who love Bradley Cooper, he was
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.360]   he's living the fantasy that all of us have had when we're in a public space, and we see
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.560]   someone using a phone camera, bro.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.200]   Jimmy, but it was it was fun to watch that.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.840]   You see him like slowly just give it to me.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.440]   And immediately go landscape, I'm showing some good taste.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.600]   I think I think he could tell this is going to be crappy if I don't get a hold of this
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   thing.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.440]   So there's a journal says that Ellen did receive training in the use of the galaxy.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   Not much.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   But it's a rehearsal.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.560]   Well, she's an iPhone user.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.400]   So you know, she immediately went backstage, took back the iPhone and tweeted out that
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.960]   she had met that other hunky guy, you know, the one I'm talking about.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.040]   I think it's a good picture.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.560]   Now here's the question.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.880]   You see Kevin Spacey in the back, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt with his mouth wide open.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.000]   I love Jared Leto.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.600]   He's kind of photo bombing it.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.200]   Of course, Ellen sitting in the real streets, laugh.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.360]   So is Jennifer Lawrence.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.920]   How do you think the celebrities get paid for that?
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.960]   That's a heck of a selfie.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.560]   What I wonder is, do any of those people have promotional contracts with like other makers?
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   Right.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.160]   And were they were there people like fielding phone numbers?
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.320]   You know what Mitsubishi just paid you a half a million dollars in Singapore to never be
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.400]   shot by any other selfie camera ever.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.600]   That's why Johnny Jr.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   Wasn't in there.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.280]   By the way, here's the here's the Photoshop.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.120]   Of course, immediately, redditors go crazy and all space.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.720]   That's really all you need.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:33.480]   Once you got Kevin Spacey in there, I really think that the IOSA should have that as a standard
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.720]   like camera enhanced, but does the space spacey eyes button.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.440]   I'm amazed galaxy doesn't have it.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   You know, you know, that would actually be a great hangout.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440]   Hangout thing.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.480]   You know, they have the little glasses that you just have a Kevin Spacey face that everyone
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   can wear.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.160]   Apparently she gave everyone in her audience.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   I don't know.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.160]   Does that mean the Ellen show?
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.080]   She gave them all a galaxy note three.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.600]   You have to look at home with them for you and for you and for you.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.200]   It's just when we it's so annoying that when I run these YouTube clips, which are basically
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.160]   ads for Samsung products.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.160]   They've got to run it.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.560]   I've got to see a yogurt added in front of it.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.160]   We're using really great thought.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.840]   Is someone at Samsung not really thinking this all the way out is that if you have a
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.000]   segment that you want people to actually watch, the key is to not monetize it.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Right?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.800]   If you have a say, talk.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   What?
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.240]   So it's because whoever uploaded this thing turned monetization on.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.880]   Oh, on the YouTube, I see what you're saying.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.160]   So by the way, nice plug first.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.360]   I guess Samsung bought some time on Ellen as well.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.360]   Right.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.120]   So they donated dollar every time someone retweeted the photo and the photo got retweeted two
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   million times so far.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.120]   Yeah, it's going up all.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.080]   I think there was at some point they said it was three million dollars.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.560]   She said, I think they said it was being tweeted 250,000 times a minute for.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.360]   I almost retweeted it.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   Stop.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.280]   Well, as funny as I was going to retweet it, I was like, Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.560]   And then as soon as I went there, I realized Twitter, Twitter went on.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.720]   Well, that was the other thing she declares triumphant.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.200]   Really, we killed Twitter as if Twitter isn't killed.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.080]   Well, like it wasn't as historical as I think she thought it was.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.080]   Right.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.640]   But it hadn't happened for a long time.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.920]   I was like, wow, this is first fail wheel in a couple of months to run, find the fail
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   wheel in the closet.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   Get it back.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.360]   Anybody got the fail wheel slide quick.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.200]   So they're all getting apparently they're all getting Samsung Galaxy.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200]   Look at that.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   Look at that.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.440]   Look at the problem with television.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.600]   You have the Academy Awards.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.960]   You have some of the coolest actors ever in one room and still the host is saying, Hey,
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.440]   everybody, turn off the TV.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.600]   Go to Twitter where the cool story, the interesting.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.880]   But I think that it also, I mean, we're one of the things that I think is really interesting
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.680]   though is that I think a lot of people are going to take that as a lesson about how to
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.000]   take a, if you're doing a live event, whether it's online or whether it's on, on TV, finding
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.200]   some way to connect with that audience and have them actually do something is very powerful,
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   you know, and to get you a lot of much better.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   We are.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   And I think a lot more of this.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   We're going to see a lot more of this.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.680]   You know, of course, a lot of people watch the Academy Awards live.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.280]   You can expect more of that kind of programming that makes it hard to skip.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.120]   Although I did this.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.280]   I did what most people or many people do.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.440]   I started the recording in a half an hour later, watched it.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.640]   Well, no, but I think, I think the thing is is that this is, it's so valuable to be
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.360]   doing stuff that's interacting with the audience because now it becomes a must have.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.480]   It's crossing across a couple of the social networks.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   Thanks to the Globe and Mail who points out that in fact the copyright for the photo belongs
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.960]   to Bradley Cooper.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:37.760]   Because he takes the photo, he owns the photo.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.760]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.200]   It was paper of record for a reason, Leo.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.240]   They also point out that Liza Minnelli desperately tried to get in the shot, but could not.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.880]   She was way up in the back.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.880]   She was to run down.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.520]   No, Liza was way in the back.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.960]   I thought she was right behind.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   She was right there.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   I think she was like one or two.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.600]   I think she's behind Julie Roberts.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.160]   She was part of the Wizard of Oz tribute.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:04.760]   They cut to it out of the three surviving children.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.760]   Right.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.760]   Right.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.960]   So, Alan made a joke about her too saying, "Nice costume, sir."
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   I thought that was a little unkind.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.560]   I thought that's the only way with it.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.920]   I'll bring it back on for some reason because she's not, there was only the 12th time in
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.160]   human history, a human being has won the Egot because the person, one of the composers
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.480]   of the Frozen song also has won a Tony Award, an Emmy, and a Grammy.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.160]   The youngest Egot, yet 39 years old.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   Exactly.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.120]   And Liza is one of the only other people who have, living people who have actually won
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   those things.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   So, you'd think there'd be like, Hustler backstage for photo op.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.680]   I'm sure you could have twisted her arm into getting her picture taken into the journey
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   Oscars.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.440]   Logan Mail points out that if Alan wishes to use that image in any other promotional
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.560]   material, she must get Bradley Cooper's help and approval.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.560]   Written apart.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.560]   Standard waiver.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560]   He wants photo credit.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   Exactly.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.160]   Really, there is Mac news.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.240]   I'm going to, one more thing and then we're going to take a break and then we'll actually
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.560]   come back with some action content.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.560]   Although I'm enjoying this.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.560]   I know.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   I think.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.560]   Thank you for solving my problem.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.560]   Actually, thank you.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.560]   What did I, what did I say?
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.560]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.640]   So the Mac Pro, just an update on the Mac Pro, which was flaky and weird.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.000]   And I thought it was just me.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.320]   You know how you play, even I blame myself.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.080]   Oh, I must be doing something wrong.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.360]   That's why it rebooted three times in three minutes.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.800]   It must be me.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   So unplugging stuff.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.400]   Maybe I have a bad drive.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.000]   Maybe something's going on.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.040]   Fortunately, Alex wanted to benchmark that this is the new Mac Pro.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.760]   The late, what they call the late 2013 Mac Pro, even though no one saw one until 2014.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.320]   The late 2013 Mac Pro is late.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.480]   So Alex wanted to benchmark it.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.480]   So an idea.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.400]   Which is I don't actually do anything last week.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.760]   And you gave it to Keith.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.520]   So I was like, I handed off some.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.520]   Okay.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.160]   Like of course, I say on the show, I'm going to benchmark it and then I hand it off to Keith.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.160]   That's fine.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.440]   You have people to do that.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.440]   So then I said, but check the USB, you know, do some big read writes and stuff like that.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.440]   And Keith is very thorough.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.880]   So he wasn't able to do anything, right?
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.200]   Well, he just said, no, he gave me.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   Keith sent me this long thing.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Like this is what I did.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.600]   And this copied the first time.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.760]   He doesn't copy the second time.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.320]   This will solve this wall install.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   And it's kind of up and down.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.760]   It was just like this thing is a big mess.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   You said it was haunted.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   Haunted.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   Then he tried to run diagnostics.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.760]   Couldn't.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.760]   Right.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.240]   And he had the good sense to pull out one of the Ram monsters.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   And finally that way.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.880]   Did he get in an indicator that there was problems with that ram or Keith knows a lot
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   about these things.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.640]   He just thought about it and said, you know, maybe this is like bad ram.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.280]   And it is, by the way, that is a that is a kind of a bad ram.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.680]   Something went weird intermittent stuff because it made just getting to its accessing that
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.280]   memory and not getting out.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.040]   So I don't know if this physical damage on this ram is germane or not, but there was
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.480]   a visible scuff mark.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.160]   And actually, this is the ram module.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.280]   This is an apple module.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.400]   It was a BTO.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.000]   So it came with three sticks, 12 gigs.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.520]   And then as ordered, they put us a third thanks to Ed Inber.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.960]   They put a fourth one in.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.360]   But this is, can you see that's a little scuff there?
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.200]   And if you'll, first of all, that shouldn't be there.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.720]   That's something, somebody stepped on it at the factory.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:18.280]   And then Burke thinks that there's damage to a couple of these traces right here.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.520]   And maybe up here too, you see that they got smushed.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.440]   That clearly got smushed.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.200]   So I had already called AppleCare and they did a lot of diagnostics.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.360]   And then they said, well, just let us know what else and try this, try that.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   And so I emailed him that and he called me and Cody called me from, he was up, he's
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   up in Sacramento.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.120]   He called me and said, send me pictures.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.760]   So that's why there's pictures of this.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.760]   And they said, yeah, that's right.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.000]   So let me call around and see if I can get a replacement sticker ram for you.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.640]   He called me back and said, none of the Apple stores anywhere in the country have anything.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.960]   But here's what we want you to do.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.960]   Put the stick back in, bring the whole thing to the Apple store, let them test it.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.680]   If they agree there's something wrong with it, they will then give you the Mac back, take
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:05.520]   it back home and in a month or two, when they get new RAM, you will, we'll, we'll come back
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.400]   up and we'll install it for you at no charge.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.200]   And I said, yeah, no.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.200]   Thanks.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   Too long.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.400]   I'm not going to make three, two or three trips up there, et cetera, et cetera, for the
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.400]   RAM.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.440]   So I checked Max, say, other world computing has it.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.600]   Do you think Renee or anybody, it's the same?
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.400]   I mean, it's, they say it's compatible.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   It's compatible.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   I don't know if it's identical, but it's, I'm sure it's not identical.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.800]   Maybe you just discovered another one of the supply constraints, Leo.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.320]   Um, yeah.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.440]   Well, in fact, I then got a call from Austin where they're making these things.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.160]   And for a very nice lady, Christina, who said, well, we're, you know, we're calling
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.520]   all the people who have problems with their Mac Pro, see what's going on.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.520]   Right.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.240]   So I filled her in on this problem.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.560]   She said, well, let me get back to you.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.760]   So I haven't heard back from them.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.840]   But meanwhile for $74, I ordered another four gigabyte module.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.040]   It should come today.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.040]   Uh, yeah, it's not this.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.440]   It's, they say it's, you know, it has all of the things that Apple does, you know, Apple
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.040]   specified thermal sensor, for instance, but I don't know.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.040]   I mean, I don't know if it's the wrong.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.040]   I've used them for years.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   I've always been good.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.320]   I love other world computing is great as far as I'm concerned.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.320]   I just, yeah.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.200]   So my age, every time I see prices for RAM, I always think in the early days when I have
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:29.520]   four gigs, 75 bucks, cost as much as I was like, I, I, I bought a 64, I think it was a
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.960]   64 gig, um, or 64 meg, meg for $900.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   It's DDR3.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.960]   It's ECC.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.800]   Although it's interesting.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.040]   If the modules are bigger than I think eight gigs, then it gets a different kind of ECC.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.640]   Anyway, it's all, it's very complicated.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.400]   So my first question was, and I think we already figured this out, it used to be you
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.280]   had to add RAM and, and payers.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.280]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   We haven't had to do that for a while.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.000]   Yeah, you haven't had to do that for a while.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   The Xeon is not a very modern chip.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   So I wasn't sure.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.920]   But it comes with three anyway, comes with 12 gigs and an empty slot, right?
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.760]   Yeah, but there is three channel RAM, I think, on the new Mac Pro is like on the, on all
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.760]   recent inhaling machines.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.160]   I don't know how the two's match into the threes anymore.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160]   Does it even matter?
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.960]   Maybe you need six now because it's a multiple.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.440]   The only thing that we, we tend to be, um, so what we tend to be superstitious about is
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.440]   we tend to make sure that all the RAM is made by the same manufacturer.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.440]   Well, this won't be because we'll see how that goes.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.520]   I don't, I don't really need it because I don't know if it's plenty, right.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.480]   But for you, you said you want more memory to really do those benchmarks.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.480]   You need more memory.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.960]   So I'll give this to you after I put, get the new RAM in and we'll see.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   You just give the RAM to us and we'll put it in.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.240]   I would have, I would, it's not what Apple says is not unreasonable.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.880]   It would have been, it would have been nice if they'd said, Oh good.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.680]   We'll send you a new module, send the old one back.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.680]   It's clearly scuffed.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   They've never done that.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.680]   They don't do that.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.680]   No, ever, ever, no, because it's, it's, then it's a warranty issue.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.320]   They just asked a user to do something that, right, they, they want it to sit or something
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   they should do.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.200]   It is user upgradable part.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.960]   It is, but it's, but, but they don't want to be accountable.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.480]   They don't want to send you something new and then have you come back and say, yeah, it
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.680]   didn't work because you know, you get it.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.240]   You know, I scuffed it for all they know when we, when we pulled it out, I stepped on
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.240]   it, right?
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.240]   Right.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   So they don't, they don't know what happened.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.240]   Leo Laport.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.160]   And, and you can clearly see me with my thumb on the gold contacts.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.600]   So obviously I ruined that RAM anyway.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.840]   There's no, also there's no static wristband.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.840]   I was about to say.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.840]   Yep.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   Apple busted.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   I'm busted.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.960]   I kind of missed the static wristbands.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.280]   But do you think that, I think that doesn't mean that maybe that's one supply constraint.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   They don't have separate memory that they said it will be available roughly the same time
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.080]   the Mac pros, the next jet ship and a Mac pros is available.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.480]   I mean, that's three, eight and they're waiting.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.480]   So maybe it is.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   So maybe it is.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.480]   You just call, you know, they should call crucial.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.480]   They should call, they should call Mac world, Mac sales, other world computing, other world
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.160]   computing and just say, Hey, we could use some, some RAM.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:05.760]   Then of course on Google plus everybody was in, I, I see no evidence that this is the
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.960]   cause of the issue, the protective covering looks fine.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.960]   Okay.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.960]   Whatever.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.960]   Obvious photo shot.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:17.760]   I agree in biology from, I mean, whether the scuff did anything or not, it's clearly
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   scuffed.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.320]   That's, that's, that doesn't seem right.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.000]   Well, and what we know is that we took it out and everything worked fine.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.840]   So the, the, it's not that we looked at it.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.200]   Instead of a scuffed and decided it was broken.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.880]   It was that all the tests were failing.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.800]   Then we took that out and then all the tests were working.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.480]   And it doesn't look good.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.040]   No, it should not be scuffed.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.760]   You know, I would not trust it if it was scuffed.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.520]   Whether that's a problem or not, it's not right.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.760]   It ain't right.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.200]   And it did squish this trace.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.400]   This trace is definitely squished.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.200]   So also if you unpack it and it looks like it was licked at the factory.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.360]   I would also, I would not sign for the pack.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.400]   So it's spit in my Mac pro.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.200]   Is this for Leo?
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.400]   Oh, oh, that guy.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.320]   I could resist.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.800]   It's just such a sexy design.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.000]   Oh, no, stop it.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Oh my God.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   There's a hippie.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.800]   There's a hippie chest hair inside the fan too.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   All right.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.160]   We're going to, anyway, that's the update on the Mac pro.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.320]   It's working just fine now with 12 gigs the way it got intended.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.480]   And, and I'll just, I'll put the other world in, but I don't even really need it.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.680]   You, is for your benefit.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.680]   Yep.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   Cause I don't, I mean 12 gigs.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.280]   Basically, I, I could be using a Chromebook for what I do with that thing.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.800]   Don't say that in public.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.040]   You know, just, just to hunk off a lot of people, you should attach it to a VGA monitor.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.400]   Like a, like a old one.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.040]   Like, you got an old, uh, sun monitor around there somewhere.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.480]   We'll go to the, to go to the recycling depot, but next time you just see the big pile of
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.760]   monitor, just grab one.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.360]   Not even a view sonic.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.040]   And then Keith did all the updates into it.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.240]   Packard Bell, Packard Bell VGA screen.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.960]   I, I really think that, uh, uh, Apple's doing its best.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   I really do.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   And I'm not, I'm not upset.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   I'm really not.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960]   Uh, and it works.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   It works fine.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.600]   And, uh, it looks good with a VGA monitor.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.840]   Actually, the Apple has no idea who I am, uh, through all of this.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.680]   Cody says, you sound like you know what you're talking about.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.680]   So I said, yeah, thank you.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   I don't.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   Keith does.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a break.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880]   Come back.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.960]   We'll talk about the iTunes festival and Nolan.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.640]   It's all about Nolan.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.640]   It's all about the Nolan.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.840]   Did know this.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.200]   You didn't know all that.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.720]   Is it named after, uh, Thomas Nolan, the creator of Photoshop?
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.520]   It's another Noel.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.320]   Our show today brought to you by something that is actually quite NOLY, Squarespace.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.640]   They're making the web beautiful ones, one site at a time.

[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.320]   They've really done a nice job of making it easy, but you know, you don't have to be
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   a coder to do this.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   I mean, you can.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.680]   They have a developer platform that's even more incredible, but really anybody can make
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.080]   a unique, beautiful site with Squarespace.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.600]   All the sites, all the templates now have e-commerce, which is great for, uh, they can
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.600]   accept donations.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.640]   It's great for a nonprofit or a cash wedding registry or school fund drive.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   It starts as low as $8 a month with the annual plan.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.240]   That includes a free domain name.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.920]   All the annual plans do.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.240]   If you want commerce, yes, you can sell one product for $8, but up to 20 products for
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:11.320]   $16 and unlimited products, digital physical services for $24.

[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.760]   Please use it so they know that that's where you heard it.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.520]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.320]   We're working for you.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.400]   We're working for you Squarespace.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.320]   We love them.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.720]   Knowling.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:07.480]   This is an article from the Australia and newspaper, well, news.com.au.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:13.440]   And a very interesting article that submits that perhaps the secret to Apple's retail
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.760]   success is Knowling.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:24.880]   The term was corned by a janitor, Andrew Cromolo, who worked in Frank Gury's furniture fabrication
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:30.640]   shop, Gury, one of the world's most famous architect in many ways, and certainly an innovator
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.640]   in his designs.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.920]   You've seen beautiful, soupy, deupy, gury buildings all over.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.560]   The great furniture, evidently.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.720]   Mickey Mouse Symphony Orchestra Center in Los Angeles, whatever it's called, the Disney
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.720]   is Gary.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.760]   So is Experience Music Project, I think.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.000]   He was designing chairs.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.240]   A lot of architects do this.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.240]   Me as Van Der Rohe did it.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.800]   They look very much like a deupy.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   Soupy, deupy.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   Ooh, beautiful.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   Yeah, they do.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   They look like his buildings.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:04.600]   Anyway, he was designing chairs for a company called Knoll, a design firm known for its angular
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.280]   furniture.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:13.160]   The janitor noted as he was tidying up, the Gury's tools were all arranged at right angles
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.160]   on the surfaces.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.520]   He's one of those guys.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.600]   I'm in the right angles.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   And he called the style of organization Knolling because they were designing chairs for Knoll.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.880]   Kind of interesting.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:34.000]   Contemporary artist Tom Sacks, who also worked in Gury's shop, made it into his personal mantra,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.800]   "Always be Knolling."
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   And Knolling is half the battle.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.440]   You're waiting for someone to say, "Is this all organized correctly?"
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.720]   And the other guy goes, "I don't know."
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.560]   Here's the rules for always be Knolling.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.640]   This is from Ten Bullets, his 2009 studio manual.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.440]   Is this, did you do a search for Knoll?
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.440]   This is the idea.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.440]   This is that you take similar items and you put them next to each other.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   Yeah, let me give you the rules.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   You're the rules.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.080]   Scan your, one, scan your environment for materials, tools, books, music, etc., which
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.560]   are not in use and put them away.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.640]   If you're not sure, leave it out.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.240]   Group all like objects.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.680]   Group all like objects.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.080]   And then, oh, Andy's laughing and I'm laughing because I think our houses don't look like
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   this.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   Exactly.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.040]   This is where refugees from the, from rolling and Knolling internment camps come for peace
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   and safety.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.720]   I'll never be Knolling as Andy's motto.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   And then finally, a line or secret.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.960]   If we have, fly free of laptop I sent back two years ago.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.080]   Work shoes that I got from my dad's garage when we closed up the house but haven't touched
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.080]   sand.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.040]   Excuse me, when you see somebody who's doing this, you'll think they're mentally ill.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.560]   You don't assume that they are.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.480]   See, I go through, I go through states, looking at this, I go through states of Knolling.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   You know, which are the...
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   Yeah, tribe.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.480]   You know, my house will be like a mess.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.240]   But if I have enough conference calls, my house will become very clean.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.680]   As soon as it becomes clean, I start doing exactly what it says here.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.680]   I didn't know that it was called.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.880]   A line or square all objects to either the surface they rest on or the studio itself.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.360]   So everything's at right angles.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:21.600]   And apparently Steve Jobs knew this or somebody did because if you look at an Apple store,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.960]   it's all knolled.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.520]   It's perfect.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.360]   No wires visible.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:30.600]   Frankly, very few curves visible.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.800]   It's all squared off right angles.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.680]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:40.360]   It's just that I, you know, in high school in the 80s, I worked at the computer department
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.800]   and the office equipment department at a big department store.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.400]   And apparently we were into...
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.000]   We got memos about Knolling as well and we called it, you know, get that crap off the
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.600]   shelves, make sure everything's lined up perfectly.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.520]   That was like the last thing we had to do, like after we'd sent the customers home before
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.720]   we could go get our coats and go home, which was to make sure all the laptops per square,
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.920]   make sure that everything's going to be put back away.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.400]   I enjoy those Knolling pictures because I just enjoy...
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.240]   There is something about my personality that says that I love seeing like 400 different
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.960]   types of phones and one gallery all lined up nicely.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.080]   I'm not sure if I would take all the 400 phones in or in my hardware library and line
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.960]   them up that way, but it's nice.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   No, it's just...
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   It's just...
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.080]   Knolling is just self-soothing behavior for a certain type of person.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   That's right.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   Some people are just...
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   There's nothing negative about it.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.120]   It's just that sometimes you get a certain amount of pleasure of the meditative act,
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.120]   just like raking those...
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.040]   Cause those parallel lines in a sand bed.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.360]   I'm going to take everything out of my pocket.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.840]   I'm going to take all the cards out of my wallet.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.600]   I'm going to line them up very nicely.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.200]   I'm going to observe them as a collection of objects.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.680]   I'm going to delete everything that looks superfluous and then I'm going to put it right
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   back.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.640]   I should give full credit to Emma Overton, who wrote the original article for the Australian
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.720]   site, askmen.com.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   Become a better man.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.000]   Become a better man by Knolling.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.680]   And then I didn't know this, but apparently Conan O'Brien has a term for it.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.680]   Stack and block it.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.960]   He just wanted to say German Game Show Channel.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.240]   I'll try to German Game Show Channel.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   And it's very old.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   It's very old.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.240]   This is weird.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   This is very strange.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:24.880]   Right now they're in the middle of a show called Stack and Blockin, where contestants
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   have to arrange items on a dresser at right angle.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.000]   That passes for fun in Germany.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Let's take a look.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   This is a little German.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I'm trying.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   I'm not.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   I'm stuck in black.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.480]   Oh, no.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:48.160]   He's measuring it with a T-square.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.720]   Oh, my.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.560]   You really must suck in black and black.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.560]   It's a little OCD.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.560]   It's really a show.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.640]   It's a little bad as some of the Japanese game shows.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.160]   Now would you, if you were really, really into this, would people just call you anal?
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.280]   It's OCD, I think, really.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.080]   But there is something to be said for.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.680]   If you're lining it up, it's Knolling.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:19.600]   If you then have to touch the tip of the screwdriver nine times and then the tape measure four times,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.640]   something that perhaps that you should seek a metal.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   Right.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   That's OCD.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.120]   But there is a lot to be said for having a tidy workspace where everything kind of is
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.680]   where it should be.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.760]   Your mind then doesn't have to spend any energy on the workspace.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.240]   It spends energy on the work.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.240]   Right.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   There are a lot of well-organized empty stores too.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.400]   I mean, it's not certainly not the secret to out of success.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.400]   I got to say, the people ruin it.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.640]   It's stack and block and when the store opens.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.240]   But then I've never seen an Apple store that's not overflowing with round people.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   I'm pretty good.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   All on Facebook.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   I'm ruining.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.240]   I'm ruining.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   I'm ruining.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   So I think if really Apple.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.520]   Like those children with their chubby, chubby cheeks.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.520]   Hate that.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.520]   They should be acidic.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   They should be linear.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   Yes.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.360]   In Syracuse, and it's necessary but not sufficient to Apple success.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:11.160]   Did you all read the excerpt from the new book about Apple and Tim Cook?
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.160]   In the Wall Street Journal.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.600]   Should I summarize it a little bit?
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.480]   This is going to be a book.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.640]   Let me see if I can get the name of it.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.640]   Revelation Leo.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.000]   It actually explains quite a bit.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   It was such a good piece.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.240]   I actually pre-ordered the book.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   I can't wait to read it.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.200]   Although some people think it's kind of a hit piece on Cook.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.840]   I'm not looking forward to the book.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.840]   I'm going to read it, but I'm not looking forward to it.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.360]   Haunted Empire.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.960]   It's called Apple after Steve Jobs.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:46.320]   It's written by former Wall Street Journal reporter Yukari Kane.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.640]   The hit on it, and I think this came from Jim Dowrymple, was that a lot of this is second
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.160]   hand.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.680]   She wasn't there, but of course not.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:59.040]   That's how reporting is.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:04.400]   Shortly after Tim Cook succeeds Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple, she says, he told a confidant.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.120]   He got up every morning reminding himself, just do the right thing.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.040]   Don't worry about what Steve would do.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   Right on.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.480]   We've talked a little bit about that, that that can haunt you.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.200]   It hurt Ford for a long time, for instance.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.840]   Henry Ford looking over your shoulder.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:24.240]   Talk's mentioned that several times.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.120]   Apparently he's also fairly demanding.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:31.640]   We know him as the supply guy, but in meetings apparently he could be fairly demanding.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.480]   Although I don't know a C-tech CEO when you finally hear of these stories of Bill Gates.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   They're not demanding.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.920]   There was a story years ago where he had a problem in China and he turned up the guy
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.920]   and he goes, "Why are you still here?"
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.560]   That was still when he was on.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.400]   Then the guy left the table, did not go home to pack.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   Yes.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.480]   He went to the airport and then went to China.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.980]   Right.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.920]   One planner recalls Cook saying, "Your numbers make me want to jump out that window over
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   there."
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:04.080]   But didn't Steve Jobs said, "You're ruining my company?"
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.280]   He said, "I said a lot of things."
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.240]   But Bezos has said exactly that.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.840]   This is what this good CEO maybe has to do.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:19.040]   The impression that I get from, I don't know as many people who've worked with Tim as I
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.600]   did, people who worked with Steve Jobs.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.960]   But the impression that I get from those conversations is that if Tim Cook says something
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:30.000]   like that, you know that it's a rational response to actual data and that if you present
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.280]   him with the exact same situation a week later, he will have the exact same type of response.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:41.120]   What's the improvement that a lot of people are citing is that we feel as though the CEO
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.840]   is on an more predictable and even keel.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.400]   If it's related to something, yeah.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.120]   I mean, I don't think I would survive along with a boss that's quite that demanding.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.480]   But it seems to be well within the bandwidth of when you have a job that reports directly
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.680]   to the CEO, "Well, damn it.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.160]   You really do have to have the spreadsheet with the right numbers.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.040]   And if there's any fudge in that number, you better make sure you get that out before
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.280]   you go into the conference room."
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.760]   I don't think that's a rational idea.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:15.440]   Here's the paragraph I think to me was the most interesting.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:21.040]   Meetings with Cook could be terrifying, she writes, "He exuded a zen-like calm and didn't
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.040]   waste words.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.680]   "Talk about your numbers.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.800]   Put your spreadsheet up," he'd say, "as Enerstah Mountain do.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.080]   Some staffers wondered why he wasn't bouncing off the walls from the caffeine."
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.920]   But remember Steve Jobs very famously said, "Enough small talk."
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:43.000]   I guess the story was a Monday and someone came in, they're starting to meeting with
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.600]   Steve Jobs and they asked him how his weekend was.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.960]   And I think that the quote was, he said, "Let's bring the intelligence of the conversation
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.960]   up, shall we?"
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.520]   That's small talk.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.400]   And I will say that as something got a job to do.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.560]   And Andy can probably attest to that in Renee.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.880]   If you're at Apple, you meet every in an Apple meeting, they are notoriously short on small
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.360]   talk during, you walk into a conference room and the only thing they're going to talk about
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.360]   is what you came to talk about.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.680]   Now, if you go to lunch, you can talk about anything you want, but literally in those
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   rooms, they're the only thing I've ever heard.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.680]   That's a good corporate culture.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.680]   It's of me.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:22.960]   And it is across the board, every Apple home, place I've ever been, to have meetings for
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.960]   whatever reason.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.400]   A lot of software development as a third party developer.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.160]   And we'd show them what we were working on.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.680]   And just zero small talk.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.480]   I don't have too much of a problem with that.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.960]   When Cook turned the spotlight on someone and she writes, she goes on to write, he hammered
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.400]   them with questions until he was satisfied.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.400]   Why is that?
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.400]   What do you mean?
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   I don't understand.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.400]   Why are you not making it clear?
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.400]   He may not have said it like that.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.400]   He might have said it like that.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.400]   Why is that?
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   What do you mean?
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.680]   I understand Bill Gates had a reputation between the same thing.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.920]   Jeff Bezos, the meetings in Amazon are silent for the first 15 minutes.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.880]   Because if you're presenting in a meeting, you are allowed to write a six page press release
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.480]   for what this feature will do.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.360]   The press release is the press release that will go out to the public so that it's focused
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.040]   on how is this going to make the public's life better, right?
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.200]   And you give it to all the executives in the room.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.760]   They read it for 15 minutes and then you begin.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:23.200]   I think this is a very smart thing in a corporate culture to have a culture of we don't have
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.320]   time to waste.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.320]   Let's get to work.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   Especially at that size.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.120]   I mean, that's a massive scale.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.640]   Cook also into the power of silence.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:36.280]   He could do more with a pause than jobs ever could do with an epithet.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.600]   When someone was unable to answer a question, Cook would sit without a word while people
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.920]   stared at the table and shifted in their seats.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:48.200]   The silence would be so intense and uncomfortable that everyone in the room wanted to back away.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:54.080]   When perturbed, Cook didn't move a finger as he focused his eyes on the squirming subject.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.640]   Sometimes he'd take an energy bar from his pocket while he waited for an answer and the
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.760]   hush would only be ruined by the crackling of the rapper.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   That's only one step, guys, in trouble.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.760]   That's doctor.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   No stuff.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.800]   You imagine someone like leaving Apple and five years later every time when their kids
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.680]   like opens up a rapper or something, yeah.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.160]   All of your stacks come in plastic baggies.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.160]   Nothing to crinkles.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.100]   He gets up at 4.30 or 5 a.m. hits the gym.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.600]   He eats protein bars throughout the day.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.880]   Simple meals like chicken and rice for lunch.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.680]   In human stamina, he could fly to Asia, spend three days there, fly back land at 7 a.m.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.280]   be in the office by 8.30 interrogating somebody about the numbers.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.400]   Relentlessly frugal.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:39.080]   For many years, Tim Cook lived in a rental unit in a dingy ranch style building with no
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.280]   air conditioning.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.360]   He said it reminded him of his humble roots.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.920]   When he finally purchased a house, it was a modest 2400 square foot home built on a half
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.080]   lot with a single parking spot.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.800]   His first, this is a good measure in Silicon Valley.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.960]   His first port scar was a used Porsche Boxster.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.560]   Ooh, who would buy a U?
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.440]   I wasn't even allowed in the Apple parking lot.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.480]   The poor man's Porsche.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.360]   Even his hobbies were hardcore, cycling and rock climbing.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.840]   I don't know.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.160]   This sounds like a good guy, actually.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.480]   The kind of guy who gets to be CEO of Apple.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.520]   Yeah, he gave away the frequent flyer miles he racked up his Christmas gifts.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.920]   He volunteered his super kitchen during Thanksgiving.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.000]   He raised money for multiple sclerosis with a two day cycling event across Georgia.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.280]   I mean, you know, and I have to respect him.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.000]   We all heard the story of the shareholder meeting right last week.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   I love that story.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   I don't think we talked.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   I don't think we talked about it.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.520]   No, after the show.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:41.560]   So there was a conservative group in there, a conservative think tank in the shareholders
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:46.080]   meeting and they raised the question with Tim Cook, you know, all of this environmental
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.520]   stuff you do hits the bottom line.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.640]   It's your return on investment.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:59.880]   You really ought to be paying attention to this, you know, the cost of this.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.960]   They were pushing a shareholder proposal that would have required Apple to disclose the
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:08.520]   costs of its sustainability programs and to be more transparent about its participation
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:13.880]   in trade associations and business organizations promoting environmental sustainability.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.840]   Shareholders rejected the proposal just less than 3% of the vote.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:23.040]   But during the Q&A session, the representative of the NCPPR asked Mr. Cook two questions.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.080]   First, he challenged an assertion from Mr. Cook that Apple's sustainability programs
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.800]   and goals, for instance, 100% of its power coming from green sources are good for the
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.520]   bottom line.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:40.640]   He said, "Isn't that just because government subsidies, government subsidies on green energy?"
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.040]   And then he said, he asked him to commit then and there to only doing things that were
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.680]   profitable.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.520]   This is Brian Chaffin writing in the Mac of Server.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:56.040]   What ensued was the only time I can recall seeing Tim Cook angry and he categorically rejected
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.920]   the worldview behind the NCPPR question.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:03.160]   He said, "There are many things Apple does because they are right and just.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.360]   A return on investment is not the primary consideration on such issues."
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.560]   He says, "I don't consider the bloody ROI when we work on making devices accessible
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.240]   by the blind."
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:23.760]   What I love is the next one where he says, "If you want me to stop doing things only
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.240]   for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock."
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:32.040]   He's not saying that he never pays attention to ROI, but he's definitely not saying that
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.000]   he's only going to pay attention to ROI.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.840]   Get out of my stock.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.520]   Also it was a really impugnant question.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.120]   If it were a legitimate shareholder raising a question saying, "Hey, I don't particularly
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.680]   care about your corporate imperatives.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:53.040]   I invest in your company because I think that it will yield better returns for my clients
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.840]   and retirement portfolios."
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.840]   That's okay.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.240]   Maybe they would have phrased it differently, but this was a guy from a think tank group
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   who just wanted to get a sound bite that could put on a postcard or a new cash.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.240]   He did.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.640]   He got the sound bite.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:11.560]   Ukari Cain's book about Tim Cook is coming out just a few days from March 18th, haunted
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.480]   empire Apple after Steve Jobs.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   You're right.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:21.440]   I got to say that has to be one of the many downsides of being CEO of Apple.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.680]   Every other executive at every other company is allowed to simply head up a company with
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.320]   lots of responsibilities, lots of opportunities, and lots of challenges.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.440]   Tim Cook now has to be a celebrity where people have to start hammering out his personal life
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.720]   and the fact that he doesn't wear his personal life in the form of a press release means
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.240]   that it's a mysterious thing that people now have to investigate.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:46.160]   I imagine that that's just a weekly bummer for him to have to deal with that kind of stuff.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:51.520]   Elon Milio said that when he was briefly and notoriously Apple CEO, he said, "I thought
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.320]   I was here to run a company.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.680]   That's right, like running a religion.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.760]   It's a very different job."
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.080]   Anyway, I think on balance, Tim Cook comes out pretty good.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.480]   There's still a question, as there always will be about Tim Cook, clearly not Steve Jobs.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.760]   Does somebody in Apple have the vision that Steve Jobs did?
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.880]   I don't think we're going to know for three to five years.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:18.600]   I think that's for it to really understand how culturally what it's done.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:23.280]   Which is why a haunted empire book is probably premature, but again, I'll tell you.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.640]   It's a title that is meant to get headlines and to sell books.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.160]   But it's interesting, just like when the Andrew wrote the first really good book, excuse me,
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:38.200]   the first real book on Johnny I, the fact that this is a new book that covers a subject
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.400]   that hasn't really been covered in such depth.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.880]   We'll have to get our hands on it and see if that drives with reality.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.120]   But the fact that this book is out is makes it interesting book for anybody.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.920]   I look forward to it.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.680]   But my hopes were dashed a lot when I read the New Yorker articles.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   I thought that article was...
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.720]   The New Yorker articles?
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.360]   Were the New Yorker also?
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.960]   There was an article she wrote in the New Yorker that was not put in the magazine but was
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.320]   put online.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.960]   It read like one of those analysts who spent years covering Apple but never understood
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.880]   them was a typical... Apple hasn't put out any new great products, Apple's been without
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.880]   Steve Jobs.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.120]   Really, if I hadn't seen her name on it, I would have thought it was just another one
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:20.600]   of those wacky analysts and not thought about it for two seconds.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:25.760]   So I hope the book is a lot deeper than that article was.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:30.000]   We're going to take a break, come back, we'll talk about Snow Leopard, end of the line for
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.320]   this four-year-old operating system.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.080]   The Apple TV rumors.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.080]   True?
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.080]   Nope.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.440]   And a lot more.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.560]   Should you have a clip on Beard standing by so that it's just wrong with the same?
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.560]   I haven't even imagined it without the bottle line.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   Well, yeah.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.560]   A clip on Beard.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.480]   I've got to get Jim on the show at some point.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.520]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:55.720]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks, the simple online accounting solution built
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:02.120]   for small business owners like me, like you, it's tax time.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.120]   Don't we dread April 15th?
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:07.440]   It's just a nightmare because now you're in that, probably very likely in that position
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:12.280]   where you got all the 1099s and now you're looking through receipts and digging through
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.400]   invoices, going through the records.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.200]   If you had only been using FreshBooks this year, the simple cloud accounting solution
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.960]   that makes tax time a breeze with FreshBooks, well, it starts with invoices.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.000]   You create beautiful professional looking invoices.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.160]   That's really what I use them for.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.200]   I started using FreshBooks 10 years ago.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.880]   It was a lifesaver for me, but you can also capture and track expenses.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.560]   Now you can get real-time business reports with just a couple of clicks.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.160]   They've got mobile apps which make it easy to use FreshBooks on your phone or your tablet
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.760]   to keep track of time and hours and expenses.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.560]   Just the fact that made it easier for my clients to pay was such a relief.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.960]   I actually got paid faster because I started using FreshBooks.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.840]   Used them for years until I finally had it.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.480]   It took four or five people to replace FreshBooks in an accounting department.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.760]   The sooner you start using FreshBooks, the sooner you can start focusing on doing what
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.720]   you love, focus on the work, not the paperwork.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.600]   They've got a great deal right now at GetFreshBooks.com.

[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:36.080]   Make sure you put Mac Break Weekly if you do get FreshBooks in the How You Heard About
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   a Section.

[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.680]   Tax time will be a breeze.

[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.400]   Mac Break Weekly.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:52.600]   Make sure you tell them that's where you heard it.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.200]   Have we nold our desks here, women?
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   It's hard because it's round.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.200]   The desk is round.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   The desk is round.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.720]   There, the handles gotta be right.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.600]   We mentioned last week the iTunes Festival at South By.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.600]   That's exciting.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.600]   It's gonna be big.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   They added more people since the last time we talked about it.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.280]   They got a sound garden plan.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.640]   And Gruber thinks that this is gonna be the release of 7.12.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.160]   Which would be interesting because it'd be the first time they released an OS with an
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.800]   X.1 without a gold master seed.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.160]   They haven't done the gold master yet.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.160]   Nope.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.160]   They've done how many 8-baitas?
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.040]   7-7, I think.
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.840]   So according to Gruber, Apple's gonna stream the performances at South By.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.080]   They've always done it on iTunes.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.080]   You watch Live, it's fun.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.120]   But they're also gonna do it on iOS.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:44.440]   He says, "I've heard from a little birdie, a little birdie.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:48.680]   The app requires iOS 7.1."
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.120]   So we'll have to hurry up.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.120]   That's all I gotta say.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   It's coming up.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   It's next week.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.120]   Well, when's music?
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.120]   It's soon, right?
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.920]   Coldplay, Keith Urban.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.440]   He's so great on American Idol.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.840]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:10.600]   Kendrick Lamar, Pitbull, Soundgarden, Imagine Dragons, five nights, he starts March 11th.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.600]   Soon.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.120]   That's cold play.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.120]   So do you think?
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.120]   Is that credible?
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.960]   I mean, John's pretty connected.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   Good sources.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:24.680]   That'd be a good way to get a lot of people upgrading.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   You know what?
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   That's good timing, right?
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   You can't run that.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.680]   You can't use the app unless you run 7.1 and you have one day to install it.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.960]   The adoption rates are so high anyway.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.960]   They don't do anything.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.720]   And also, we forget that the iPhone is such a mainstream device that what percentage of
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.960]   the people worldwide who have iPhones or even even care about South By.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.960]   South By.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   Music.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   Saturday, March 15th, Keith Urban, Willie Nelson and Mickey Guite.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:56.480]   And I want that show on your iPhone on my iPhone or iPad.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.120]   All right.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.920]   Well, from John's lips to Tim's ears.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   Oh, that sounds a little dirty.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.640]   You've been reading my fan thing.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:12.720]   There's a lot of necessary updates and that and the sooner it comes out, the better.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:17.840]   Will people be a little reluctant though to jump to 7.1?
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:18.840]   After the hazards of 7.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.640]   If they get a respring a day, probably not.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.440]   This is an eagerly awaited update for a lot of people.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   This is an incident.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   This is not incidental.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:31.360]   Still, your advice would be to wait, right?
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.120]   I usually upgrade some of my devices and then leave the other ones.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.120]   It's a launch.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.200]   Only five betas the chatroom reminds us.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.200]   Thanks, Dark Macintosh.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.720]   You know, it's weird.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:46.600]   Has everybody updated all of their for real day-to-day use devices to 7.1.0?
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   No, 6.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   Better do that.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   And then I'm talking-
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.040]   I mean from iOS 6 to iOS 7.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.200]   I still have one holdout.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.800]   I had one.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.040]   I had a- I think I went a week with 7 and then just upgraded everything.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.480]   I was just like, okay, this is much better.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:06.480]   I have an iPod touch still on 6 for testing, but my Mac Pro just went to Mavericks yesterday.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.680]   After getting used to 7, I kept on looking back at 6 and it felt so ancient that I was
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.680]   like, ugh, okay.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.960]   You waited to go to Mavericks till yesterday, Renee Richie.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.440]   I still haven't gotten to Mavericks.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.760]   I usually wait six months to a year on whatever machine I use for podcasting just in case.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.200]   Because sometimes it's weird software that like, yes, what's it called?
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   A pastor app.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.880]   We are so different because I actually install the new version of the operating system during
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.880]   the podcast.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:31.880]   During the show.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.480]   Almost always during the- it's a long-standing tradition unto it.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.360]   I think the only Mavericks we have are the computers that we bought since it was released
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.600]   or, you know, come with Mavericks.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.160]   And so we've got like three or four machines that have Mavericks on them, but outside of
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.160]   that we're all still 10, 8, 6.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.160]   I don't have a-
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.160]   I don't have a-
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:50.280]   This is not a specific vote against Mavericks or 10 or iOS 7, but my day-to-day use iPad
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.320]   is still running iOS 6.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.400]   Only because I haven't- I haven't- every time I think I'm going to get around to it,
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.840]   I don't get around to it.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:01.960]   And I've asked myself, well, why do I have to get it done right now and put things off?
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.120]   It's like, nah, okay, iOS 7, there's a lot of things I like about it, but nothing that
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   I have to do.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:13.000]   On my 15-inch MacBook Pro, I still have it on- I still have it on the previous edition.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.160]   Again, because I have Mavericks running on two different new machines that I've bought
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.960]   since- since it came out.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:21.960]   And I like it.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.320]   It's just that I don't miss anything when I switch back to this other computer that
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.160]   still has the older operating system on it.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.600]   That's unprecedented in my history.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.400]   I feel as though I really should.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:34.240]   Like I said, it's not a- it's not a vote against iOS 7.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.720]   It's not a vote against Mavericks.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.240]   It's just that there hasn't been that moment that said, ooh, I've definitely- here's an
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.040]   app I really want to use that requires this.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.840]   I better download and update this right, right, right, right now.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:47.320]   Well, you better update it if you're on Snow Leopard.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.320]   Snow Leopard what?
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.320]   Four and a half years old?
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.320]   It's frozen.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.200]   We were giving- No, that's- That article's not right.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.200]   That article's horrible.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.200]   It seems older than that.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.160]   Are you talking about Greg Kaiser's article in Peter World?
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   Yeah, it's horrible.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.840]   Okay, let's take it out of the equation.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.800]   Peter Cohen got so angry he wrote an instant rule level.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   Titty?
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.600]   Yeah, because it's still available for sale on apple.com.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.000]   It's still being upgraded as recently as whenever I think.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   I felt-
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   It was not susceptible to this SSL hack, therefore, it did not need to be patched.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.920]   It didn't have the go-to-fail problem.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.600]   Yes, correct.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.640]   So Apple hasn't retired from support?
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.040]   No, not yet.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.360]   Just didn't need to update it for that.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.760]   Well Greg Kaiser, what the hell?
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:31.360]   I mean, I trust computer world, so I went with it.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:36.680]   So yes, I did notice you could still buy Snow Leopard.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.120]   So Apple's made no announcement.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.640]   We're not going to support Snow Leopard.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:43.280]   So really the take on this is if you want to stay secure, just keep on using Snow Leopard.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.280]   Well, use this.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.920]   I mean, use something that doesn't have this bug.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.960]   So one of the reasons I finally updated was I had to do the SSL bug, fix anyone.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.000]   I figured out it might as well just put Mavericks on it.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.040]   The SSL bug is a Mavericks issue.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.800]   It's not Snow Leopard, Lion or Mountain Lion, according to Peter.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.120]   I don't remember if it hit Mountain Lion or not, but it's been about a year.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.560]   Peter says neither Lion nor Mountain Lion.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.560]   Snow Leopard, I'm really actually relieved.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:13.320]   Because there are max as little as five years old that can't go beyond Snow Leopard.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   Right.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.840]   People still use it for the Rosetta.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.840]   Is it Rosetta?
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.840]   It's the last Rosetta.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   So if you have a--
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.840]   You want to run Photoshop 5.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.840]   Right.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:27.680]   If you have apps that were on PowerPC, you can't go past Snow Leopard.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:32.960]   But as we always say, it will continue to run all the software that it ran at the time
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.640]   when you've decided to pass on the upgrade.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   Right.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:41.560]   But you can't complain that every piece of software and every operating system that
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.400]   Apple-- every piece of software ever written will always work with the machine that I had
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.200]   when I was in middle school.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.600]   Well, I apologize.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:53.160]   I mean, I should-- thank you, Peter Cohen, for setting the record straight.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:57.000]   I used to think-- I've no longer do, but I used to think of Computer World as a reliable
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   source.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   I apologize.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.840]   That one author has not got a good track record when it comes to Apple.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.760]   I mean, there's a lot of really good writers there, but that one author doesn't-- he likes
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.760]   us to get to Apple, it seems more than anyone.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:13.240]   Peter says, Greg Kaiser has a very long history of twisting whatever he can find with an anti-Apple
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.240]   slant.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.920]   He's an Apple troll.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.720]   So Computer World, maybe you want to think about.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.240]   Let him cover something else.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.680]   Moving them over to the Microsoft side.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:28.720]   Wow, that's-- I apologize, folks, for repeating that story.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.280]   I think I talked about it on a twit on Sunday.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.760]   We'll have to fix that next week.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.480]   Well, I mean, the truth will be when there is an issue that affects Snow Leopard, where
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.640]   their Apple updates it and does so in a timely fashion.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:42.560]   I just think you can't tell that based on them not having to update something.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.920]   It didn't have a problem, so we didn't fix it.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.920]   That seems reasonable.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.000]   Is that OK with you, Mr. Kaiser?
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   Jeez.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.040]   But it did lead to a good conversation about who upgrades when?
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.520]   The security-- and you know that well from security now, Leo, is that people report security
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.080]   used without giving them any context.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.320]   And it happens so often, it ends up just scaring people.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.320]   It's hard work.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.080]   I'm glad we have Steve Gibson, who kind of vets this stuff.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:13.240]   And then I try to always think with the grain of salt-- grain of salt in this thing.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.560]   This one, I just-- I trusted the computer world.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.560]   That's terrible.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.480]   Now I'm nervous about all these other stories.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:26.320]   Apple details touch ID and the A7 secure enclave, an updated iOS security document.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   Which is actually terrific.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.840]   That whole document is fantastic.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:37.480]   Your enclave is-- it sounds like a place where data is stored securely.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   Is that correct?
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.240]   It's a custom A7 chip.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.800]   They have a secure enclave on that chip.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:48.200]   And the touch ID sensor is actually individually paired with every A7 chip.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.000]   So if you swap out the sensor, if you get your hands on the phone and think you could
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.080]   just swap out the sensor, it won't work.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.480]   You literally have to have those two components together.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.840]   And it goes through a hardware channel.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:00.280]   It never goes up into the higher functions of the phone, into RAM or anything else.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.400]   You put a lot of effort into making that incredibly secure.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.400]   Oh, I think--
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:11.000]   Each secure enclave is provisioned during fabrication of the chip with a unique ID.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.480]   So each chip has a built-in unique ID.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.160]   Other parts of the system can't get it.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:19.720]   It is not known to Apple according to this document.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:25.880]   When the device starts up and a femoral key is created, is mashed up with a UID, probably
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.480]   in a hash function.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:33.120]   And that's what's used to encrypt this secure enclave's portion of the device's memory space.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.920]   So that's secure.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.360]   Even Apple can't get into that.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:40.120]   Well, I think that that also points to that Apple is not going to make this just a convenience
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.120]   item.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:45.720]   I think that there's a-- I think you go through that kind of trouble to use it for a lot of
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:46.720]   things like that.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.880]   I have to ask Steve about this because they're not using hash.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:55.280]   They're using a term I have not heard before, tangled.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:59.960]   I don't know if-- Steve will know if this is a standard security term.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:04.800]   Data that is saved to the file system by the secure enclave is encrypted with a key tangled
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.120]   with a UID and an anti-replay counter.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.120]   Sounds good to me.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.120]   I'll take it too.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.400]   There were a lot of people at Apple worked really hard to make that.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.920]   I mean, some people thought it would come out last year, but they really took their time
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.440]   and did a lot of smart stuff with it.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:21.520]   Nope, by the way, that despite all the flame that Apple took for its fingerprint read,
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.200]   nobody said anything about the Samsung S5 fingerprint reader.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.760]   I saw that a lot.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.040]   But to be fair, Apple didn't get any heat until they actually shipped it.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.120]   Alfred Ingrid didn't write his letter until the 20th, after 10 days, and when he hit stores,
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.760]   and no security people could get their hands on it to test it until after it shipped.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.960]   So hopefully, I don't think it's a fairness issue as someone who's got friends who are
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.200]   going to buy Galaxy S5s.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.040]   I just want to know that they are safe and secure and sort of how Samsung is implementing
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.040]   it.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:53.840]   I'll tell you, Samsung has a template because this document is really great.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:57.360]   They need to release something like this.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.520]   And my understanding is that Apple hasn't given it to third parties yet because it uses
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520]   a yes/no token.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.040]   That's what keeps it secure when it releases the information about the fingerprint.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:09.200]   And securing that when it goes to third party hands is probably trickier.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.600]   And I'm going to see how Samsung is doing that because they did announce an SDK.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.560]   Apple says the A7 processor gathers the fingerprint data but can't actually read it.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:25.520]   The exchange takes place between the A7 and the secure enclave fully encrypted.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:31.160]   It's over a serial peripheral interface bus that is encrypted and authenticated with a
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.040]   session key that is negotiated using the device shared key that is built into the touch ID
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:40.720]   sensor and the secure enclave using AES key wrapping.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.160]   This is serious stuff.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.240]   No third parties are allowed.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.760]   There's no API, as you said.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.560]   Touch ID authentication and the data associated with the enrolled fingerprints are not available
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.480]   to other apps or third parties.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.880]   That does hobble what it can do.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.760]   I mean, only Apple can use it.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.160]   For now, I mean, I think it's just a question of time.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.000]   Well, because this kind of security has to be embedded inside hardware.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.160]   And if you screw it up, you can't just do a software patch to fix it.
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.360]   It means you have to recall phones or at least decide that an entire generation of hardware
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360]   is a complete write-off.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.120]   So that's not surprising.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.640]   This also has information about how stuff is encrypted in iMessage.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.440]   Well, I want to--
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.840]   It's a big, open question.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.880]   Steve Gibson has held that what Apple can do with iMessage, for instance, taking your
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:38.640]   message when you start up a new device, the iMessage then appears on that device is a
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.640]   definite indication that Apple does have access to that data unencrypted.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.840]   The interesting thing is it looks like there's two systems there because they say that Apple
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.680]   makes a unique key for every device.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.240]   So it'll try for a couple of days to deliver a message to a device.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.440]   And if it's using a unique key for that device, if it can't, that message doesn't get there.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.680]   But you do backup on message to iCloud.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.800]   So if you restore a device, it restores all the messages that device has received.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.400]   And that's part of your normal iCloud backup.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.760]   So it looks like there's two distinct sorts of ways that in which Apple is handling iMessage.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:16.360]   I mean, I'm not enough of a security expert to vet the document, but kudos to Apple for
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.360]   publishing it.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:23.800]   iOS security is published on Valentine's Day.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.800]   Love letter to security nerds.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.560]   It does sound like it's using strong encryption.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.080]   Each key pair of the private keys are saved in the devices keychain.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.120]   The public keys are sent to Apple's directory service, as that all sounds reasonable.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:42.760]   Anybody wonder why they didn't release this last year?
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.880]   I'm going to take them this long to write it.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880]   It's all about ID stuff.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880]   It's new.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.760]   The iMessage stuff probably isn't much ID stuff.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.760]   It's new.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:04:00.200]   I mean, when they first released the iPhone 5S, I'm wondering how long it took, how long
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.280]   the vetting process took, and how many sign-offs they had to get on the stock before they made
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.280]   it public?
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.760]   All of them.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.840]   It's probably like a chocolate from an energy bar on the corners of every page of that.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.040]   They also cover Siri.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.120]   They cover FaceTime.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.720]   This really is a full document on how iOS keeps your stuff safe and private.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.200]   I am sure that they released this now because of all the concern, thanks to the NSA and
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.400]   so forth, and they wanted to get it right.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.520]   I think it probably took this long.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:37.720]   The NSA revelations were in June, the iPhone 5S came out in fall.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.280]   I bet you they didn't have this doc.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.720]   It just took them a few months to write it, or to put it all together and to vet it.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   The one-
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.640]   Yeah, it may represent things that have been added since.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.640]   Yeah, since since.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.760]   Well, I wish other companies would do this.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.560]   Conclusion, a commitment to security.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:00.960]   From hardware to encryption to device access, each component of the iOS security platform
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.640]   provides organizations with the resources they need to build enterprise-grade security
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   solutions.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640]   That's an important phrase.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.840]   They really want business to trust this as well as individuals.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.040]   The starting phrase is great too.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.600]   It says that iOS was built with security in mind first.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.600]   Yep.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.600]   That was a priority.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.400]   iOS apps, designer, Apple are built with enhanced security in mind.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:25.280]   Safari offers safe browsing, EV certificates.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.840]   It really does make you think that here in 2014, the features are really great.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.520]   The features that people are most interested in a phone are the screen, the camera, the
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.360]   app library, and now the security too.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.600]   And now any company, even if they haven't been really paying attention to that so far, they
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.440]   now have to make sure that's part of the marketing as well.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.720]   If it's on page three, page four or page eight, it has to be there.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:54.760]   Here is how we are securing your phone to make sure that it can't be compromised by either
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.960]   commerce-minded or government security-minded individuals.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:05.400]   They define tangling down here as this is actually a well-known.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:10.640]   I've never heard the term "tangling" but they're using PBKDF2.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.040]   And Steve has talked about PBKDF2.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.040]   And you have to think--
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040]   It's good.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.920]   If you have an antenna gate, people are frustrated, but if you start tying transactions
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.840]   and something goes wrong, people feel like you've got a hand in their wallet.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:26.360]   So you want to make sure that you preemptively, especially if another manufacturer, whether
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.920]   it sounds like someone else has a fingerprint sensor, and it's not great and there's a lot
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.440]   of publicity around it.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.920]   People start lumping Apple into it.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.960]   They probably want to have a really good foundation for how their technology works out
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.760]   there ahead of time.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.760]   We'll get Steve to it.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.480]   If he's not securing us coming up, if he hasn't already, we will get him to vet this document
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   and translate it into English.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:54.440]   You know, there's also a precept in crypto that says that if you want to digitally secure
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.560]   something, you make it more secure by making your methods public because that way the
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.920]   entire community can hang on it and tell you where--
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.040]   Find the faults in it before you make a commit.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.680]   Maybe the stockman is also part of that as well, that if there is something that is going
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.120]   to cause a lot of people to either correctly or because they don't know what they're doing,
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.600]   complain that, "Oh, well, it doesn't have this or it doesn't conform to this standard,"
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.320]   or there's a weakness that was published three years ago in this paper right here.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:25.640]   It gives Apple an opportunity to head that off and say, "Well, no, actually, we're going
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:29.960]   to add a section here that explains that that's not the case," or quietly say, "Yeah,
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.000]   guys, let's fix that before we actually put that under product."
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.240]   Also, from Apple insider Daniel Aaron Dilger writing that Apple is preparing a software
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.240]   update, unclear if it'll come out with 7-1, that will fix some of the problems people
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.760]   have had and enhance functionality in the Touch ID, the fingerprint fade, particularly
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:52.440]   authentic, which is the fingerprint recognition company that Apple bought last actually two
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:56.000]   years ago.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.880]   The team is still there and they are working to improve the recognition software and release
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:09.720]   an update relatively soon, including a solution or he believes addressing that issue of fade,
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.280]   which is after a while it stops recognizing your fingerprint.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.280]   Is anybody tried?
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.680]   I have a 5S my daughter has it now, unfortunately, but has anybody tried Steve Gibson's technique
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.680]   of adding points?
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.200]   Does it seem to help?
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:29.160]   I'm on 7-1, which has been rock solid for me, so I don't know if it's that if it's a
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.720]   7.1, but I think in general it's working really well on whatever latest version they're doing.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:40.040]   I'm sure we'll understand better when 7-1 comes out.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:46.840]   The stores are discounting Apple TVs adding a $25 iTunes card that's led some to think
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:50.520]   to assume to predict a new Apple TV coming out this spring.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.440]   Jim Dallerable of the loop says, "Noop."
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.040]   That's all he says though.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.520]   Nope.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   That's all he ever says.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.520]   Yep.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.520]   Nope.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.040]   So, he's reliable source, yes.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.520]   Yep.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.960]   That means not necessarily that there isn't a new Apple TV, but just that there won't be
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.760]   the one this spring.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.880]   There's new software almost definitely, but I guess the hardware is dependent on what
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.040]   Apple wants to do if I don't think they're anywhere near going 4K yet.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.200]   If they want to do an SDK that requires a lot more storage or memory or something better
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.400]   than half of an A5 chipset, they'll need new hardware.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   But if that stuff is not in their immediate pipeline, then the software update cannot
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.680]   come soon enough, and then they can release the hardware when they are closer to the other
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.680]   stuff.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.680]   Nope.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.680]   I think everybody's right.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.680]   It's just a question at timescale.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:43.600]   He highlights the could signal a new Apple TV on its way and then says, "Nope."
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   That implies never.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.600]   Well, no, I mean, Jim knows--
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.600]   Not on its way.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.200]   There's-- but they're prototype 2, 3, 4 years out.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   Right.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.200]   There's always something--
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.640]   There will be a new Apple TV someday.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.800]   I mean, I think the most likely would be to add more features to Apple TV, and if you're
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.040]   going to do that, then you talk about a WWDC.
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.800]   You know, you give people time to develop.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   That's June.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.800]   That's June.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.520]   It's been about same very, very boring feature list, rounded corner box, and always about
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.400]   just simply adding more software and adding more services to it.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:22.600]   By the way, Apple TV is more than a hobby, at least if the B word determines that.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.680]   It's a billion dollar business baby.
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.880]   Tim Cook said it, "The Share Hole is meeting a little more difficult to call it a hobby
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.680]   these days."
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.240]   Ten million units if you do the math.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.880]   Well, that was the billion counted content sales.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:42.920]   Ah, so it doesn't mean 10 million units.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.920]   No.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.560]   But it's still-- I mean, a billion dollars is something a lot of companies would just
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.560]   love to have.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.120]   A billion dollars in one fiscal year.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.120]   For a hobby.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120]   Not a bad hobby.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.720]   It's an Apple scale hobby.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.160]   When do we think the next software update is soon?
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:04.320]   I mean, I had to-- if there is any SDK stuff involved, I think Alex is right, and we'll
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.320]   see it at WWDC.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.040]   But if it's strictly an interfaced improvement, I think it could be earlier.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.040]   They need to improve the interface.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.000]   Yeah, I still can't search across content.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.280]   If I just want to find a movie and don't care if it's on iTunes or on Netflix.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.280]   That's what we need.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.080]   Spotlight for Apple TV.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.440]   It's-- I'm really looking forward to the next update too because-- ah, damn it.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.960]   If I frozen again.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.720]   But you've frozen in such a handsome way.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.760]   At least I was smiling when it happened.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.760]   Okay.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:34.280]   It's just that every-- usually when we see a Apple product be this static for the
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:40.960]   this long without being short ordered-- excuse me-- very few changes, but you're still widely
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   available.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.280]   That usually means they have something really, really, really momentous in terms of the next
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.280]   update coming.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.720]   So that's what I'm looking forward to for the Apple TV.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.960]   At this point, they fall in way behind the Roku.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.040]   And I don't think that it's because Apple has forgotten about it or doesn't care about
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040]   it.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.040]   It's because they're not making any incremental.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   The next change is not going to be incremental.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.040]   It's going to be massive.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.560]   His lips never moved in that entire speech.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.160]   His amazing-- I think you had to take out ventrilo-- ventriloism.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.160]   Ventriloism.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.160]   Lip gum.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.160]   Did you see John Dravolta?
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.160]   Oh.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.160]   That was painful.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:22.840]   It's called Too Many Martinis Before the Show.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.840]   I don't even know whose name he was trying to say.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.400]   Edina Menzel.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.640]   He didn't say Edina Menzel, did he?
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.320]   Someone-- one of my favorite bloggers said, you know, John Dravolta's job on stage.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.240]   He only had to do two things.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:41.520]   Die his hair a natural color and say Edina Menzel, he failed to do either of those things.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:48.120]   Let me play the clip of-- I think he's on here.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.120]   Oscar moments.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:55.160]   Please welcome the wickedly talented one and only.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   That does the--
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160]   What?
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   Did he say?
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160]   Let me-- wait, wait, wait.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160]   We're going to play that again.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.160]   I don't think he knows.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   Listen.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.160]   He's welcome.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.160]   The wickedly talented one and only.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.160]   That does the--
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.160]   You're back.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.160]   That's-- that's-- that sounds right.
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.160]   It's like someone on American Idol and can't remember the words.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:25.520]   Well, I mean, so the funny thing about this-- you know, we work on a lot of live shows with
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.520]   celebrities and--
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.600]   What you end up with, you saw this with Harrison Ford as well.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.960]   You can-- like, if you work on a lot of these shows, you can tell who was worried about
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.120]   their presentation and who didn't care.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.800]   So like Harrison Ford obviously did not-- I don't know.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.800]   He's probably not on there.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.960]   It's not like he made a mistake, but he obviously-- the first time he saw whatever he was saying
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.960]   was when he was on there.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   Was the first one on there.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.480]   Yeah, it's called-- it's called cold reading versus--
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.480]   Right.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.800]   So-- but you can tell that some people who thought about it, they worked on it.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.360]   You can tell they probably practiced it over and over and over again.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.000]   And then there are some people who decided that they were just going to-- you know, this
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.400]   is something they have to do.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.560]   And so they just-- they got up and did it because they want to--
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:06.480]   So he was supposed to say-- what was the name he was supposed to say again?
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.040]   And he didn't even tell.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:14.440]   And he said and still-- so now there's a-- if you go to Slate, there's a little calculator
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.240]   that delves the same name generator.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.800]   You could revultify your name.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   Oh my gosh.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800]   Let's see.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.800]   Let Leo Leport--
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.800]   That's why you're going to crack up.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.800]   Luke, he'll be--
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.800]   Well, Alex, one more.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.880]   You can only do it once.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.960]   They force you to reload so that they get all the pages.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.960]   Alex, Lindsey.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:43.360]   And now the wonderfully talented-- let's welcome the stage the wonderfully talented
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.160]   Argylez-Zwiz.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:51.560]   Just call me Argylez-Zwiz.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:58.000]   And that's the day that he finally believed his wife that, yeah, maybe I should get my
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   contact when the script is updated.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.600]   And then I actually-- very sympathetic.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.400]   Because once you've done that, you can't like say, well, let me fix it.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.400]   No, they moved on.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   And you're--
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.240]   You live in infamy forever.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.840]   Forever in infamy.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:16.440]   And then I want a video of Tim Cook just looking at him with a power bar.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:20.440]   Reddit, make it happen.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   Yeah, Reddit will.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.440]   Reddit will do it.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.240]   Are you worried?
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.760]   Android is 62% of the tablet market.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.960]   No, another bad stat.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.800]   No, it's not a bad stat, but it just shows how badly we do it reporting mobile devices.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.840]   In the car industry, stats like this wouldn't even be considered because it's mature enough
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.840]   to be segmented.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.840]   Right.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:46.240]   My understanding is a large number of those devices are just-- are video players in Asia
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.280]   that just happen to run Android as it means to playing video.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.400]   Well, that's the first question you should always ask when you hear it.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.280]   You should always hear these things is worldwide are US.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.280]   This is worldwide.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.000]   Yeah, worldwide US and above $200 below $20.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   Right.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   Right.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.280]   So worldwide, at all price points, Android tablets were 62% of sales in 2013 according
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.280]   to the Gartner Group.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.560]   This is the first year that that's happened.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.560]   Apple did sell.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.200]   We should point out 70 million iPads in that period.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.560]   It's funny is when Apple-- when the iPad was hugely successful, Apple got lumped into
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.720]   media tablets or some other category that would ostracize them.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.640]   And now the tablets are mainstream.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.320]   Everything is lumped together in another way that makes the iPad look like.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:29.040]   And if you look by vendor, Apple still is completely dominant.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:35.840]   Apple is the-- on this pie chart-- I love pie charts-- Apple is blue.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.840]   Others is black and--
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.800]   Now others is those video players.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.960]   That's those little $200 or less video players.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:44.160]   Samsung is light blue.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:50.560]   And I still think when you look at Amazon and Samsung and possibly even Nokia slash Microsoft,
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.120]   I think you really want to know who is selling those because I think those are destined to
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120]   fork.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.240]   You know, I think those ones-- I mean, Amazon's already basically forked it.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.720]   I think the Chinese ones aren't even running.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.720]   They're running Android open source products.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.720]   Yeah, it's AOSP.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.200]   It's not Google services.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.160]   So Google gets no benefit from that.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.160]   It's just an open--
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.640]   I think it's more benefit from iPad than they do for most of the entire time.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.640]   That's probably true.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:20.400]   Point one 5% of mobile gamers account for 50% of all in game revenue.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.400]   You know who you are, by the way.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.400]   That would be me.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   You're a whale.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:32.240]   We're the whales swerve, announce the results of its first ever-- it's a marketing app for
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240]   mobile.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.120]   Mobile games monetization report.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.560]   The vast majority of players never make any purchases.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:44.520]   Only 1.5% of players active in a month-- and this is based on a survey-- 1.5% actually
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.920]   made an in-app purchase that month.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.800]   50% of the revenue is from the top 10 players who do make purchases.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.800]   That means it's 0.15% of all players.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:58.240]   49% of all players make one purchase per calendar month.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:01.640]   13% make five or more.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:05.440]   Next to me and Alex.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:09.920]   Most of the spend activity-- a significant amount within the first 24 hours.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.480]   Right, because you're excited.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.480]   You're trying to win.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.960]   And at some point you realize I shouldn't be buying all of them.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.120]   The average time to first purchase just under 24 hours.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.920]   And if you make a second purchase-- and again, that's a small number-- the average time
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.720]   lapse between first and second purchase an hour and 40 minutes.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.320]   Just some people have no self-control, basically.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.640]   And I didn't want to admit that.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.240]   Kevin Mitchell looks about 300 bucks the first night on Candy Crush.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.240]   That's how they make it.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.240]   Oh, God.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:38.080]   53% of players who made a purchase go on to make a repeat purchase within 14 days.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.080]   47% do not.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.120]   13.7% of new players accrue more than four purchases in the first 14 days.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.400]   In other words, yeah, there's really a big divide between people who spend and people
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   who don't.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.400]   And if you spend, your chances are you're going to spend and again and again and again.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.880]   And as a developer, I think it's important to look at the last story that we just talked
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.680]   about, of the percentages of other devices and everything else.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.560]   When you're starting to think about that, I think that the-- and I think that more the
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.880]   Google services Android, I think, is a much more important number.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.480]   Because I think the Google services androids and the iOS are the two places that people
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.480]   are spending money.
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.400]   I think all the other ones are right.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.760]   This is probably the most important.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:19.800]   The average value of an in-app purchase is $5.94.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:25.400]   The majority are between $1 and $5, but they don't contribute a huge percentage of the
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.400]   revenue.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.360]   Purchase is of over $50.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.760]   Who would spend that-- oh, nevermind.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:34.400]   There are some people who don't tell you who spend $1,000 a weekend on those games.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.960]   But I know that I'm with fieldrunners, I've bought thousands of points for like $10 or
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.640]   $20, and I use them for the next six months.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.600]   I absolutely don't understand.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.680]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.040]   You don't understand why you do in-app purchases.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:55.560]   No, I'm saying that I understand in-app purchases, I wish that someday I'm making so much money
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:01.280]   that I can blow $1,000 on a weekend of in-app purchases on a game and not even notice it.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.720]   It's easy to see no idea.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.720]   It's easy to see.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.720]   You don't have to be making a lot of money.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.720]   You look at the people who go in, casinos and drop a thousand dollars on a weekend, and
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.120]   they don't necessarily.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.920]   They're betting the rent money.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.720]   But I don't know.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.720]   It's--
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:17.440]   You know, the fun thing to do when you're leaving Las Vegas is to look for the people-- the
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.120]   taxi cab driver told me this-- who are walking to the airport with their roller bag behind
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120]   them.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.120]   He said, "See those guys?"
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.120]   They--
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.120]   They used it all.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.120]   They used their cab fare.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.240]   They got-- all they have left is a plane ticket out.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.240]   Makes you sad to be human.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:32.360]   Which is funny because I go to Vegas and I-- we have to work there a lot.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.160]   And I don't have any-- I never get--
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   I never get--
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:39.000]   On the other hand, I spent $300 on Simpson's staff to have some--
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   There's that.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   --mom and idiot.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   That's the-- you know.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.840]   You know, when I was in Vegas, the thing that got me most upset on the casino floor
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:50.200]   was I already don't have a whole lot of affection for Judge Judy because she's-- in my mind,
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:54.560]   she's someone who makes $40 million a year shrieking at people who are lower income and
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.120]   telling them that I don't have to listen to your explanation of anything because I'm
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.600]   smarter than you are.
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:02.880]   And so every time I leave the-- leave my bank of elevators to go outside to get a cab or
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.120]   whatever, what did I pass by?
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.640]   A big bank of Judge Judy's slot machines.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:07.960]   Yeah, isn't that funny?
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:11.880]   So it's like-- so I guess you don't really mind so long as you're-- it's a revenue positive
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.880]   thing for you.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.880]   You not really don't care about responsible behavior.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.360]   I'd like to have been in that meeting.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.920]   Judy, Judy, you got a great idea for you.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:18.920]   How much are you going to give me?
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.600]   She takes out an energy bar and stares at you.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.600]   How much?
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.840]   Yeah, Judge Judy's slot machines.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.160]   And there-- I saw them too.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.800]   They're at that-- the Mandalay Bay.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.800]   And I don't understand it.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.800]   I haven't seen any judge.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.400]   Why would you want to play a Judge Judy slot machine?
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   What's the point of that?
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   There's a judge there.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   There's a judge there.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   No, why you're gambling?
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400]   They can't be cheating.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.640]   They got Vinnie Barberino slot machines.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:44.200]   Anything-- I can't believe they haven't come to me and asked me, would you like to be a
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.200]   slot machine?
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.280]   Give you little tech tips every time you pull it down.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:51.920]   But then they can have little things like Andy and Renee and, you know, like three
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.920]   Andes and--
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.920]   No, I would-- if you-- if you-- if I had a slot machine and you people would have a slot
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:00.440]   machine and you put money in the slot, I would just like-- the money would return back to
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.840]   you and say, actually, have you gone to In-N-Out Burger?
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.440]   Because they're only here in the West Coast.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.560]   Do you get a double double here?
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.800]   Don't give-- you know, get something.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.800]   You get three Andes.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.960]   It just gives you all the money you've spent up to that point back.
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.800]   And then it tells you you should leave.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:15.800]   By the way, this--
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.400]   It's like a penny bet will be Andy Mode.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.400]   There's the Renee Mode.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.560]   And then there's the Alex Mode where you get cocktail service.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.560]   You get Alex's--
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.560]   Hey, yeah.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.560]   Yeah, Alex, Alex, that was for--
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:28.560]   Exactly.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.080]   It only takes 700-core things, but you get a lot of--
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.080]   It's--
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.080]   And then Alex Mode, something of the resolution of the screen goes up like a--
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.080]   Because they do have buttons on these slots.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.080]   You know, how much you want to spend.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:40.920]   And it should be like an Andy, a Renee, and an Alex.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:41.920]   Exactly.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:43.920]   Giant Alex--
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:44.920]   Giant Alex--
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:45.920]   Boom.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.920]   That's it.
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:47.920]   You got no more.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:53.440]   This, by the way, was based on freemium games, examines revenue in January 2014.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:57.560]   And the data comes from Swerve says, tens of millions of people.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.920]   So fairly accurate.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.320]   The CEO of Swerve said, what's interesting is while many consider the freemium model to
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:09.400]   be successful, there is still surprisingly little data relating exactly how consumers
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.520]   interact with freemium games.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.080]   So now we know a little bit more.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.600]   And I think if you're developing a freemium game, there's probably a lot of juice in there
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.080]   for you, something you should consider.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.880]   You've got to get them early.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880]   I hope this--
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880]   Right.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.760]   --is the end of the tunnel for some developer to say, well, maybe we don't have to make
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.760]   releases as freemium.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.600]   Maybe we can actually sell this as a $2.99 and you're out game.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.160]   No, I've already started seeing that.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.240]   And I think that's very encouraging.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.720]   We talked about that on iPad that they once in a while.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.720]   That's great.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.560]   You "3s" is a good example.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.680]   It's what, $3.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:44.520]   And there's no in-app purchases at all.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.720]   And it's a good game.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.120]   I think that there are-- I think there's going to be more of that stuff.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.400]   Because I think people are reacting badly to this freemium thing.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.400]   Your lifts to 10 clicks a year.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.400]   [CRIES]
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.680]   You wonder if they-- actually, you know--
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.680]   Wow.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.720]   You smell like power bar.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:01.720]   And Mountain Dew.
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:02.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.720]   Mountain Dew.
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:08.800]   You think, though, if any company would ever do something like that, it's-- I say this
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.120]   in all sincerity, it would be Apple.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:14.480]   If ever they looked at the numbers and said, this is crazy stupid, that here is a game
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.600]   being marketed as at kids.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:21.960]   And we know for a fact that this is generating at least $280 per user per week.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:25.440]   It's not coming from kids who have eight-year-old kids' allowances.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.440]   This is probably a bad thing.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:31.600]   And we need to put in new-- either new user controls or even consider how we allow these
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.080]   games to be marketed.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.960]   I don't know if that would ever happen.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   Excuse me?
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.520]   In-app caps after you spend 20 bucks is unlocked or something.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.960]   No, we know what the future is.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:46.440]   Last week, the Guardian looked at the App Store 300 new games released Wednesday of last
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.440]   week.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:54.520]   They were all going to be like a big deal.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:03.020]   They were going to be like, "I'm going to be like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:06.520]   And I'm going to be like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:13.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:21.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.520]   And then they were like, 'I'm going to be like that.'
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.520]   Birdy flap flap flappy troll.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.520]   I love the smell of keywords stuffing in the birdies.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.520]   Other names, John Travolta has announced from them from the Oscars.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.520]   And now the incredibly talented Flappy Pyro Bird.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.520]   I have four all those programmers that listen to this.
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.520]   We are really waiting for Flappy to it.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.520]   No, no, no, no. I'm not waiting for Flappy to it.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:08.520]   How about a floppy floppy flying disc in the Land of 8-bit retro game?
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.520]   That's actually the title.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.520]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, we take a break.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.520]   We'll come back.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.520]   You're picks of the week.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.520]   So fire them up. Fire them up.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.520]   Our show today brought to you by 99 Designs.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.520]   If you, it's the world's largest graphic design marketplace.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.520]   Get the, get the, get the, this is a good, this would be a good time
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.520]   to show the hoodie with our 99 design on it.
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:35.520]   So we want to do a hoodie.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.520]   You know, we do these with, this is a clever marketing ploy.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.520]   I admitted it's a marketing ploy.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.520]   We do these. You can only get them for a month.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.520]   There's a limited time.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:45.520]   We realize if we just put this stuff on them on, you know, forever,
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.520]   people don't buy them.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.520]   But if we say you can only buy it for a month, people buy them.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.520]   Right.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.520]   And so we have these beautiful twit hoodies.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.520]   So what we did is we went to 99designs.com.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:58.520]   And we said, we needed a design for a hoodie.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.520]   We got great, we got so many good designs.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.520]   We bought five of them.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.520]   That's typically what'll happen.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:05.520]   The designers will look at your, they call it a contest.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.520]   Look at your contest and then say, you know, submit a design.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.520]   Let me go to the front page.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:15.520]   There are 285,093 designers.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.520]   They'll look at the contest.
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.520]   There are 2,284 open contests right now.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.520]   And they will submit design ideas.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.520]   You look at them, you vet them, you work with them.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.520]   We ended up buying five out of the 40 or 50 that we got.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.520]   Payouts last month to designers from 99designs, $1.9 million.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:33.520]   How much you pay for each one?
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.520]   It varies.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.520]   You set the price.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.520]   The designer decides whether it's worth it to go for the price.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.520]   It starts as low as $199.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.520]   How much do we pay for our designs?
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.520]   Do you know?
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.520]   $300 each.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.520]   Come here.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.520]   Let's see the, this is, and this is the one.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.520]   We're going to make some of the other ones.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.520]   But this is the hoodie design.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.520]   Here's Glenn Rubenstein.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.520]   And he's modeling the hoodie.
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.520]   I loved that design.
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.520]   So we took the five designs.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:56.520]   We asked you to vote and we made this one a hoodie.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.520]   Isn't that nice?
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.520]   So those are not on sale yet.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.520]   Tomorrow.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.520]   All right.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.520]   They'll be a tea spring deal.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.520]   Tea spring.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:08.520]   If you want to get there tomorrow before when it starts, teaspring.com/twit.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.520]   T-W-E spring.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.520]   But that's another story.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.520]   So, but it's a great mix.
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.880]   We don't, you know, we have some designers in house that are very good, but it's really
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:21.520]   a lot of fun to go to 99designs.com and set up a contest and get all these great designs.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.520]   It really kind of gives you a new perspective on your logo.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.320]   And it can be for a lot of things.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:29.040]   Maybe you're, maybe you design, maybe you're cooking.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.120]   You want a menu designer.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.520]   You want a landing page for your restaurant.
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:35.020]   Car wraps.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.520]   App design.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:39.520]   You get a design you love or your money back.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.520]   It's very flexible.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.520]   You just set the price.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.640]   So you, you know, you have many concepts, not just proposals, but actual concepts you
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.640]   could choose from.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.640]   It's very affordable.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.640]   It's very fast.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.640]   Here's the deal.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:58.920]   Go to 99designs.com/mbw and you'll get a $99 power pack of services free.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.480]   Power pack gives you more designer time and attention.

[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.320]   That way you'll get a lot of designs, often twice as many.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:11.560]   99designs.com/mbw.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.880]   And the process, tell me if I'm right, Lisa.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:19.760]   It doesn't cost you anything to go there and set up a contest.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.360]   You pay once you get a design.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.360]   So you set the price for you.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.000]   So just do it and get some ideas.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000]   It's great.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.920]   99designs.com/mbw.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:35.720]   We thank 99designs for some great designs.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.520]   They just did our marketing kit.
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.200]   There you go.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.200]   We use them.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.200]   We love them.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.200]   99designs.com.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.200]   Our last t-shirt.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.800]   Actually, our last t-shirt was one of our in-house guys, I think.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.800]   That was Anthony.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.800]   99designs.com/mbw.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:52.840]   Time for our picks of the week, Alex Lindsey.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.840]   You're sitting here.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.840]   Do you have a pick?
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:55.840]   I do.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.840]   My friend.
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:57.840]   I threw you.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:58.840]   I know.
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:03.920]   We're going to find out what Andy's camera of the week, because he finally bought one.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.560]   Camera of the week.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.200]   But what is your pick of the week, Alex?
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:13.120]   So I'm constantly trying to figure out what font to use, exactly how to, you know, like
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.760]   what is this going to look like with this font when we're building out bits and pieces.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:20.320]   And so a lot of times, you know, you get into the situation where you select the font
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.320]   and then you change it.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.680]   Then you select the font and then you change it.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.120]   Then you select the font and then you change it.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.440]   And then you finally just give up and move on until the client, you know, went through
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.200]   a lot of stuff and this is what we figured out.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.680]   So this actually makes it a lot faster.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.480]   So this is called ultra character map.
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:39.440]   And you know, what you can actually do, and I don't remember how much it is, but it's,
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:45.080]   but ultra character map basically allows you to, what is it, or 9.99.
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.080]   Is that right?
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.080]   9.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.080]   So great.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.760]   What it does, all it does is it grabs all your fonts and forget the 3D stuff that it does,
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:55.000]   because it's kind of silly.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.440]   But what it lets you do is type in custom.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:04.680]   So right there where you see that, you can actually type in what you're going to type.
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:08.400]   You know, so you can type there, you know, I can type pixel core or something else.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.600]   And I can see how it looks in real time in all of the fonts.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.800]   So this replaces Apple's kind of built in.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:16.800]   And it's just, it's just a lot.
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.560]   I mean, it just very visually you can see here like I typed in pixel core and I can see.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.560]   Can I just build one?
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.560]   Oh, that's all right.
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.560]   It's water.
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:24.560]   It wasn't anything.
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.560]   I don't want to let that run to you.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.360]   No, it's running off the side.
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.440]   It's on the directions.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:37.560]   So anyway, but the, so basically you can see what it's going to look like.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.360]   You can preview it in all of those fonts at one time.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:42.160]   There's a lot of other things you can do with it.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:48.320]   You can look specifically at, you know, a certain font and see exactly what it's going
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.320]   to look like.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.480]   So if I look at them, I just closed it.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:55.920]   If you look at the grid, you can look at the grid, you know, and see all of the text that's
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:56.920]   in that font.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:00.400]   So if I grab one of these and so I can look at, look at here, you can see like this is
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.960]   all the characters and glyphs that exist in that font, whether they're mapped or not.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:09.320]   So you can really see some of them, you know, are more, you know, complex than others.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:12.240]   But you can see what the, you know, I can, and you can try to figure out where to get
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:13.960]   those now that you know that they're actually there.
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:18.160]   So like Nicky Lotta with a, the pit crew in a Formula One race, you get all the way.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.360]   I know I got your guys cleaning up.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.880]   For those of you who are listening to the show, I made your pit with water on the other side
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.880]   of my face.
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:25.880]   We got it.
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:26.880]   It was so kindly brought to me.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.760]   And then I, and then I went and just opened my laptop and pushed it all off.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.520]   And so there's people running around.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.360]   Keep it open because we're setting up the camera so we can see this shot.
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:35.360]   Go ahead and flip it back.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.360]   There we go.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.000]   So that's why Chad's up on a ladder behind you right now.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000]   The other way that way.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.600]   So he sees behind you setting up a camera.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.600]   Oh, there we go.
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:43.600]   Okay.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.600]   So there we go.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.160]   So anyway, so, um, there's mass chaos.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:53.320]   So anyway, so I think that it's, um, it's a, it's a cool, uh, it's a very cool, cool
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.320]   app.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.320]   Very nice.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:56.320]   $9.99.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.320]   10 bucks.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.840]   Ultra character map there.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.400]   Finally, after all that, there we go.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.360]   See there's the grid view.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.240]   You can see me changing fonts here.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:08.360]   And then you can also just see me looking at how something like again, like if I do
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:11.960]   pixel or lovely, you can see how they all look.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.960]   Lovely.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.560]   Um, and you can get kind of a.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.560]   Pixely core.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.120]   Pixely core.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:21.160]   So, um, anyway, so that's the, uh, that's, that's the app.
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:22.680]   I like it a lot.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.000]   I use it every day.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.240]   Mr, Mr Renee Richie, your pick of the week, sir.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.320]   I have two picks.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:30.600]   One is an app called documents five.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.880]   It's the latest version of the.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.320]   I think that's pronounced two POC.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:35.320]   I was, I was explained.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.320]   Nice.
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.320]   Sorry.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.320]   Go ahead.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.320]   I have a big and a small.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.320]   Okay.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.320]   Biggie.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.320]   Small.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.320]   Biggie.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.320]   Small.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.320]   That's right.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.320]   It's 50 cents.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320]   Okay.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.320]   And just, we just want to.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.400]   So one is documents version five documents by Rital is a really good document editor for
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.400]   iOS.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.800]   But what they've done that's really interesting with this version is they've done sort of
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.320]   what Google's done with their apps.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:04.480]   And that is to get around the lack of inter app communication of contracts or intense in
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.240]   iOS, they've made all their apps work together.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:11.960]   So if you happen to have them all installed, you can hand off a PDF to their PDF app or
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:14.000]   you can hand off a scanning.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.080]   If you want to scan something, you can bring it from the scanner into the documents app.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:21.960]   So it means that you have a much more seamless, much more powerful experience if you go in
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.480]   on their ecosystem of apps.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:26.520]   And I like that idea very much.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.400]   Documents five.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.040]   Very smart Ukrainian startup company.
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.920]   They've been doing iOS apps for years.
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.280]   Igor and Dennis and they just keep getting better and better.
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.920]   And they do a lot of stuff with enterprises.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.760]   They've been working on enterprise licensing stuff.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:47.080]   And it's a very clever work around to Apple's lack of communications in their apps.
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.280]   Very good.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.520]   The second one is CarPlay, which is Apple's rebrand.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.000]   You know, we didn't talk about that.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.640]   Let's talk a little bit about that because that really we should have been our news stories.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:57.880]   The thing about this, it's really cool.
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.080]   CarPlay was sort of a name we joked about, but back at WWDC because it sounded so much
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.120]   like bidirectional airplay technology.
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.120]   Right.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.040]   And to sort of make Andy's day, the codename for this was Stark, which gives you sort of
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:12.160]   an indication as to where they're thinking about this technology.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.800]   And it's really nice because it decouples iOS from the device and lets it take over
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.320]   external displays.
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.560]   In this case, the display is of cars.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.800]   Now the car has to be running something first.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.440]   It has to be running like QNIX or Microsoft embedded or even embedded Android or something
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.200]   because there has to be an infotainment center there.
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.600]   But once that's there, as long as they have their partnership with Apple and all the optimization
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.760]   in the controls are in place, you just go in, you plug in your iPhone and apps like
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:46.720]   phone, like maps, like messages, other audio apps like iTunes Radio, iHeartRadio, the podcast
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:52.440]   app will all get a unique interface projected onto the display and the display can send
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:55.440]   data back and forth to the car.
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.760]   As is usually the case, the things outside of Apple's control can vary.
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:03.560]   For example, some of the Mercedes have very awkward displays on top of their dashboards.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:09.440]   The Ferrari that they were showing off today at the Swiss Auto Show, the Geneva Auto Show
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:13.560]   had a nice resistive touchscreen which is probably very good for leather racing gloves
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.960]   but not very good for responsiveness.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:19.320]   But the system itself seems to be working fantastically well and just lets you take
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:24.200]   everything that's on your personal iPhone and get it into your dashboard with safety
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:29.560]   precautions but also with the promise of easy updates from Apple when iOS gets updated,
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:33.880]   which is almost certainly going to be faster than the typically glacial pace that car
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.880]   companies themselves update their software.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:41.920]   I have to admit at this point, as I think about getting another car at some point in time,
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:46.480]   how my phone interacts with it is probably more important to me than the car performance
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:51.520]   or mileage or most of the other features in the car other than maybe how it looks.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.480]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.760]   I think this is a double work on it.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:00.680]   I think this is also a double big deal even when this was just shown off at WWDC, I thought,
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:01.680]   isn't that interesting?
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:06.360]   They have demonstrated the ability of iOS to project its interface to a dumber device
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:11.200]   and that makes me think that if Apple does do a wearable watch without actual screen,
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.600]   it doesn't necessarily have to run iOS now.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.960]   All you have to do is simply, since the host device is going to be an iPhone anyway, it
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:23.200]   could simply project what it needs into a much more low power, simpler dumber device.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:28.320]   The nice thing too is that Apple, unlike Samsung, will never manufacture their own refrigerators
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.800]   or their own home automation things, nor will they license iOS or any of their operating
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.400]   systems to those companies.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.120]   If they can just say your display meets these minimum requirements, then all of a sudden
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:43.920]   iOS in the car becomes iOS everywhere or whatever the future of iOS is, can start taking over
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.920]   other screens.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:50.320]   I think that lets Apple have their cake and eat it too when it comes to the internet of
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.320]   things ecosystem.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:58.320]   Well, it would be different for a device like if they ever go as nuts as Samsung because
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:59.720]   it's one thing.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.880]   It's one thing that you always have your phone in your car anyway, but if you have to go
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:05.920]   upstairs to your bedroom and get your phone out of the charger in order to get ice out
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.040]   of your refrigerator, that's a problem.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.040]   That's a friction point.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.760]   But I would love iOS on my Canon camera, for example, and Apple will never do it, but
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:18.120]   if one day there are mythical cameras that can be projected onto, I would love that too.
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:22.520]   I'm going to save you for the best for last, Andy, if you don't mind.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.720]   But I just wanted to...
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:28.720]   We were talking on the radio show the other day about the sound effects of a dark castle.
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:29.720]   Remember that?
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:37.920]   Well, it turns out Z-Sculpt has been working for some time on a dark castle clone.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:40.080]   Return to Dark Castles on the Mac App Store for $10.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:46.120]   If you played this classic game, as I'm sure many of you did, in black and white on your
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:51.120]   old Mac classic, you'll recognize the sound.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.120]   Oh!
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:39:03.080]   But now in glorious 3D, that is the sound of my at an 8.30am lecture with only two hours
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:04.080]   of sleep.
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:08.360]   You know what's funny is to really date me.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.200]   I've never actually seen dark castle.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:11.200]   You haven't?
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.200]   But what that really reminds me of is Aztec.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.600]   Does it remember Aztec?
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.600]   No, I don't.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:17.600]   Was that a Mac game?
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.600]   It was an Apple II.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:19.600]   Oh, Apple II.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:22.400]   I'm sure this was influenced by that for sure.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:23.800]   Yeah, it was very much what you were running.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:25.800]   It reminds me of beer run too.
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.800]   Yeah, well.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:27.800]   But this is dark castle.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.200]   10 bucks, return to dark castle.
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:32.000]   It's got more levels, all the classic levels.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.440]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.480]   And my quest has ended.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:39.320]   Now, at his time, ladies and gentlemen, we know Andy Inako was in the market for a brand
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:44.040]   new camera, but we don't know which camera he chose because he decided to play it coy
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.040]   last week.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:49.320]   But now he is going to reveal all Andy, your pick of the week.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.760]   Boy, that wasn't being called.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:57.120]   No, it's just that at the time, I had ordered it and arrived that morning.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:01.040]   And Justin Kays, you hate to be enthusiastic about something that still smells like packaging
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.040]   peanuts.
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:05.640]   And then next week you're like, I wish I had recommended this because now I realize it
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.160]   stinks.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.160]   But yes, this is lovely.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:17.800]   This is the Olympus OMD, the OMD EM one, which is Olympus's attempt to say, well, we've
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.960]   been we were one of the two companies that started off making micro four thirds format
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.160]   sensor cameras.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.760]   Now we're going to make one that is absolutely unabashedly.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:30.240]   No questions asked a professional style camera.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.920]   And I absolutely love it.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:37.640]   It is absolutely the camera that I was hoping for because buying a camera is like it's
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.600]   a very idiosyncratic sort of choice.
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:44.400]   It really has to be the camera for you and the way that you shoot and what you want.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.200]   I had a nice budget to work with.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.760]   This is not because this is not a cheap camera.
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:52.520]   The body alone is about $1400.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:57.840]   This lens is a made to pro specifications lens and it's about another $1000.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:03.480]   So this really is as expensive as a nice, not pro level, but a nice Nikon with a very
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:05.200]   nice lens too.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:11.120]   But the problem with that is that SLRs are just so big and they're so heavy.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.000]   They take up so much space.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.360]   This is a mirrorless compact, which means that it doesn't need to have a mirror box
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.440]   and it doesn't need to have a prism in it.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:24.160]   And for that reason, and because the sensor is smaller, the lenses can be smaller as well.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:29.240]   The reason why I started off on micro four thirds begin with was the number of times when
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:34.960]   I had to leave my Nikon D 200 at home, even though I was going on, you know, I was going
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.880]   to be in Europe for 10 days, but I just knew that I can't have this big SLR around my neck
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:42.000]   everywhere I go and everything I do.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.480]   And with these compact mirrorless cameras, even if you don't get it on Olympus, they're
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:48.680]   great because you really can break them down and stick them in your shoulder bag.
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:53.520]   And it doesn't look like you're carrying, you know, $2,000 with a camera equipment there.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:59.920]   The only worry that I had about it is that micro four thirds sensors are not as they are.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:07.120]   They don't handle high ISO's, high light sensitivity modes as well as APS-C cameras, which is what
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.260]   you get with the Sony's, with the Fuji's with that sort of stuff.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:15.240]   But this has a killer feature that sort of makes up for all of that.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.560]   This has in body five axis stabilization.
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:23.640]   So no matter what you're doing when you're holding this camera, it can really absolutely
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:26.880]   negate that and it works with any lens that you work it with.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:30.960]   And so I was able to, I went out shooting twice so far with it.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:36.400]   And the first night I had it out was just after sunset, like as night is falling like
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.720]   in Boston.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.360]   And this is exactly the right sort of situation for that sort of thing.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:47.040]   Normally if you're hand-off, I don't know if you can zoom in, but that is absolutely
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.640]   tack sharp.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.240]   And that is like a, what, a third of a second, a fifth of a second.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.640]   So such a long exposure that there's just no frickin' way that you'll get a sharp
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:58.280]   image on any other camera.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:05.200]   So yes, this doesn't work as well at high ISO's than a Fuji or a Sony does.
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:12.000]   But the thing is that this will perform, this will give you a sharp an image at ISO 1600
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.760]   or 800 as you would get from a Fuji or Sony that's working at 3200.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:21.160]   And if you had a Fuji or a Sony, you'd have to bump it up to 3200 to get that high shutter
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:24.960]   speed in order to freeze the frame.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.160]   Other than that though, I mean it's weatherproof.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.560]   The lens is weatherproof too.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.560]   You can get it in the rain.
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.840]   You don't have to really care about it.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:35.440]   It's really, it's like an AK-47.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:37.400]   It's so solidly built.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:41.720]   And on top of everything else though, I just love all of the thought that went into this
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:42.720]   tactile interface.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:47.520]   I actually thought that the lens was broken because it could not focus and then I actually
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.600]   read the manual and discovered that it's normally an autofocus mode.
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:55.880]   If you want to get into manual focus, you take this ring and you snip, pull it down,
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:58.240]   and now you're manually focusing.
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:02.320]   And so you can do all of this with the thumb dials, with this control.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:06.920]   So you can just never have to take it away from your face at all because it's all completely
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.000]   tactile.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.920]   Every knob, every dial, every function button and there are a whole bunch of function buttons
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:14.800]   all over this place can be reassigned.
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:20.360]   So within, if there's on day three, I realized that I really hate that every time, I really
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.960]   hate that the rear button is the rear wheel is adjusting white balance.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:26.200]   I don't adjust white balance that much.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:30.560]   Very easy for me to reassign it to something else or turn it off entirely.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:36.160]   The bottom line is that I do, whether my photography is any good or not, it's something
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.080]   I have a lot of fun with and I really drive myself nuts when I can't get the shot that
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.640]   I really, really want.
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.920]   And so that's why it's worth it to me to have a really good lens and a really good camera.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:50.800]   And this is just so much fun to shoot with that.
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:57.360]   I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not a gun enthusiast by understanding what some people,
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:01.600]   friends of mine who shoot guns say when they say that this is just a fun thing to shoot
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.600]   with.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:05.040]   It's just, it's just, it's comfortable to hold it.
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:08.400]   You feel as though everything is exactly where you want it to be.
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.440]   I'm just in love with this camera.
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:15.600]   So like, so I bought twin em fives for our trip to Italy.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.600]   We're so happy.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:22.520]   We shared those micro four thirds lenses and then I reviewed this on before you buy and
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.760]   it has, they've really, the M1 is, it's a little confusing.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.920]   It's better than the M5 and they've, they've learned a lot from the M5 and it's even better.
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:31.920]   It's just a one.
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:35.800]   This is, I mean, this is, I was really tempted by the Fuji is doing some great stuff with
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:36.800]   mirrorless compact too.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:39.960]   It's not the same set lens system and sensor system, but they're doing some great things
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:40.960]   too.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:45.800]   The reason why I wasn't terribly tempted by their new SLR style camera was that this really
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:50.360]   does feel like a company that's been doing this for years now and they know exactly what
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.360]   they're doing.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:55.640]   And this is like their fourth, their, their, this is the fourth generation piece of hardware
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.640]   that they've built.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:01.520]   Rest Fuji, I think they're still on their first or second generation line of thought.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.280]   They haven't really worked out all of the design kinks in terms of making a, a really
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:09.160]   fun to shoot camera and Olympus really, really has done that.
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:13.560]   Like I said, I can't, if you, if you shoot the way that I shoot, you have the same relationship
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:18.800]   with cameras that I do, this is exact, this is exactly, this is the Andy and Otco model
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.800]   camera.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.800]   Really, I agree.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.160]   It's like, I can't imagine designing something that's as good as that.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:27.000]   And finally, I mean, a couple of years ago, I thought that was going to be buying a new
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.880]   camera because I had the money set aside.
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:33.440]   It was really time for an upgrade because again, that Nikon D200 I had was just really,
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:34.760]   really old by camera standards.
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.200]   It was time for an upgrade.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:39.640]   I just didn't find anything that really seemed as though this is something that I'm going
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:42.320]   to, that's, I'm going to be able to use for the next three or four or five years.
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.920]   It doesn't feel like a really, really modern camera.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:49.280]   So I bought a really cheap Panasonic micro four thirds camera.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:52.880]   And now the cool thing is that I can take the really nice lens I bought for this will
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:55.040]   also work on that little pocket size Panasonic.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:00.640]   And I can have now, I can, now when I travel, I can actually now have two camera bodies on
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:05.000]   me at the same time because that Panasonic is about the size of a big deck of cards.
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.120]   There's just absolutely no size to it whatsoever.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.440]   So that's another benefit for it.
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.880]   But like I said, not a cheap item, but absolutely the right choice for me.
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:18.880]   Micro four thirds is the only system where it's the lenses are compatible cross manufacturer.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.400]   And there is a huge range of very good Panasonic and Olympus to both decided on get them, get
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.400]   on board at the same time.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.720]   There are a couple other minor manufacturers who are doing micro four thirds.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.880]   Who I think they, I think they have the cameras at least, are there new cameras at least have
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.920]   their own proprietary lens not as far as I know?
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:38.240]   Because like I said, that was part of the decision for me.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:41.160]   It has a larger sensor and all that sort of stuff.
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:46.160]   But the other factor is that it seems as though when a company announces they're coming
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:52.640]   out with a really, really great lens, it's micro four thirds first and then they drift
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.840]   it down to the other formats later.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:59.880]   Because there are a few truisms about cameras that have been around for the past 40 or 50
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:00.880]   years.
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.460]   And one of them is that, you know, if you can spend 90% of your money on a lens and buy
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:08.200]   a cheap body, you'll get better pictures than if you buy 90% of your money on a lens.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:11.000]   On a body than by cheap lens.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.760]   And so I'm just convinced that if next year I want to get an even a different kind of
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:19.440]   a zoom that there's going to be Olympus has a really good plan for more pro lenses, other
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:22.200]   manufacturers, really good pro lenses.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.440]   So this is going to, I feel as though this is going to be happy for at least the next
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:26.440]   five years.
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:27.920]   Yeah, I think you made an excellent choice.
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:29.760]   Really love those cameras.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.760]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:33.960]   Our slots machine is available in better casinos everywhere.
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.840]   Don't forget to bet one Alex.
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.920]   You really want to win.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:39.920]   It's so awesome.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:42.400]   I don't know who did that, but they did it fast.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:43.560]   Thank you very much.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:46.480]   And we did neglect to mention a big story that broke earlier today.
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:51.600]   It was rumored last yesterday that Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer is leaving after 18 years.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.840]   He's the guy you'd hear on those analysts calls.
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:56.000]   He's taking a job at Goldman Sachs.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.840]   I think it's safe to say he's decided to cash in.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:01.000]   He's hiring to spend more money.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.160]   More time with his money.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.160]   He also wants to get into philanthropy.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:08.400]   He wants to get his pilot's license and he wants to move.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.600]   It's got to be hard work to be Apple CFO.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.920]   He's being replaced by Luca Mastri.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:14.600]   He was a fantastic name.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.200]   Wow, that's a, did you see that?
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:22.400]   If you go down, that he oversaw, it went from 8 billion to 171 billion.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.400]   That's pretty big growth.
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.040]   No money left to conquer.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.000]   And Luca Mastri came to Apple about a year ago from Xerox.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.480]   He was CFO over at Xerox.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.640]   So I think he probably knows how to build 8 billion dollar companies into 1 billion dollar
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:37.720]   and he's got a lot of confidence too, which makes a lot of sense now.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:38.720]   Ah, was he?
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:39.720]   Interesting.
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:40.720]   Okay.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:41.720]   First appearance.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:42.720]   New CFO.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:47.280]   Apple's apparently not about this for a while and that's why they were grooming my
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.280]   stream.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:50.240]   Hey, thank you everybody.
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:51.800]   That's it for MacPrick Weekly for this week.

[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.800]   Thanks again for pitching in on that twit.
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:29.800]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.880]   It was fun to be there.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:33.360]   We'll see you next time.
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.320]   Now get back to work because break time is over.
