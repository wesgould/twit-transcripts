[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   However, we shall soldier on with Jason Snell of SixColors.com.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   I was very excited. I was thinking, "Oh boy Leo, what's the news? Tell me."
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   I mean, no.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   I got stuff.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400]   I got stuff.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   Let's find out.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   I got stuff. Andy and I can also hear it from WG.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   Hey, there, there, there.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   Hope all is well and beautiful. New England.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   Yeah, we're staying on the slide.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   Rubbing ice on our soles.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   My poor mom.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   Oh my gosh.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   Oh, we're in the United States.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   She's pointing up.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   Yeah, everybody's this way.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   Alex Lindsey, where it is in beautiful Marin County, California, where it is nothing but a lot of people.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   Where it is nothing but beautiful and sunny and rich and wealthy.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   Hi.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   I'm on the least rich part of Marin.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   You have to explain to someone that you go, you know, you ask, you know, someone asked how we ended up where we lived.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.400]   I said, "You just ask your wife what you want and you drive north until you can afford it."
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   That's what exactly what we did back in 1992 or '93.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   And of course, we drove right through him and ended up in Petaluma just on the other side.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   We have turkeys, though.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   We're different.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   We have turkeys and you're in the country.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   Yes.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   We're in the country.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   So are we.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   Yeah, you're pretty out there.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   You're pretty far.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   Lisa Struze.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   Lisa bought a hundred pounds of walnuts.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   Because what?
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   Bird food isn't good enough for the birds.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   So she bought a hundred pounds.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   You want to eat the walnuts?
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   And sunflowers.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   And she strews it on the ground, but it's not just the birds.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.000]   It turns out it is also the turkeys.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.400]   We have four turkey families, four mothers and their babies because it's that year time of year.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   And turns out it attracts skunks.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   Oh, boys.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   It was a little...
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   You've got to be careful, though.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.960]   Because you're really reflective.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.280]   One thing that we learned is that if you give a really reflective car, the turkeys will
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   attack it.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.600]   They'll be like, "You look at me?
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   You look at me?"
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.400]   You're like literally they're angry at the car and they put dents in while I'm like, "Oh,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   that's because we have a peacock.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   I can hear this don't don't don't."
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   And I was like, "What is going on?"
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   I came around and there was a turkey attacking my car.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.920]   They think it's another turkey.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.080]   We have peacocks who come up to the glass sliding glass window and look at themselves,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.240]   but they don't seem unhappy.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.240]   They see.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.240]   They start preening.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.480]   It's quite the wild life scene out there.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.360]   Hey, thanks to the anonymous Apple fan who sent Alex...
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.520]   And by the way, he's giving you the title of Commander Rebel Mac Unit.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.520]   There you go.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   Five of these fabulous...
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.560]   Definitely not close to the commander of the Rebel Mac.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.960]   Apple reusable facemasks.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.080]   More of a private of the Rebel Mac unit.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.760]   Maybe not even I was like, "Maybe yeah, that's all I did there."
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.920]   Look at that.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.520]   And they're not sealed.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.680]   So I'm not they're sealed in the pouches.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.840]   They're not the bat boxes.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   I'm super excited.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.840]   They're really nice masks.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   Those are the lips.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   We get it.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   Nice.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.080]   We ever got another time we need to wear masks.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.280]   I now have the best.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.880]   Well, there are those who's...
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.920]   Jeff Jarvis is just on an airplane flying out.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.840]   He's doing an event tonight at...
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.520]   By the way, last chance if you want to go to the Commonwealth Club and see Jeff Jarvis
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.280]   talk about the history of printing in the Internet.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   The Commonwealth Club tonight.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.160]   What are you talking about printing and the Internet?
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.640]   Well, his new book, The Gutenberg Parenthesis, is the premise of which is we've seen it all
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   before.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.240]   And so what we have to learn from the advent of the printing press in today's Internet
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.000]   Age, let me just see what the name of his title of his lecture is.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.400]   The Age of Print and the Internet.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.080]   He's based.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.640]   He's in New Jersey.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   Just outside.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   Okay, that's what I thought.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   Bedbed, but he's here.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.640]   Well, and the reason it came up in my mind is because he wore a mask.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.040]   He says that was the only one on the plane with a mask on.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.520]   But you can be sure Jeff will be healthy as he speaks.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.960]   It says tomorrow at 1 a.m. at the Commonwealth Club.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.400]   I think it's just confused.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.360]   I do believe that's a 7 p.m. appearance.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.960]   But if you go to the Commonwealth's website, it's today.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.640]   Yes, it is definitely today.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.320]   The beautiful Commonwealth Club.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.480]   Thank you Google for saying it's at 1 a.m.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.800]   Jeff will be happy to do a second speech.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.160]   It's 6 p.m.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160]   6 p.m.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   Okay.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   Yeah, Lisa's going.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.320]   There it is.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.840]   Thank you for getting that.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.520]   So I did find some news.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.920]   I looked hard.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.720]   First of all, we should say there are updates going out.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.680]   iOS 16, 6 came out yesterday.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.760]   Ventura 13, 5.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.640]   These are updates to patch.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.600]   Apple says actively exploited vulnerabilities.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.760]   So these are not things to wait upon.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:52.240]   Also if you're on an older version of iOS 1578, iPad, OS 15708, moderate 1268, Big Sur 1179
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.920]   for older devices, basically check your system updates.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.280]   This is, this is, feels like the third fix.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.880]   Didn't we have, how many rapid security responses do we have for this WebKit vulnerability?
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.120]   There was, you know, several of them I think.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.920]   But now this is a full version which will, in fact, Apple's Security Support website lists
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.800]   a large, large-ish number of security things that are being patched today.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.960]   What do you think the protocol is inside Apple to decide whether or not something merits
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.320]   one of these push outs?
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.040]   Because I know I myself, like, I'm getting a little bit confused because I'll, I saw
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.720]   the last one and then I thought, did I forget to install the one that came last week or
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.360]   is this a new one?
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.600]   So there was a, you can't pull the group to a month.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.680]   This month, there's been security response.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.560]   There was B, but they pulled that back and C and then that came out July 12th and now
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.240]   here we are on the 25th, 24th, 12 days later and they're doing the big updates which apparently
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.640]   includes some of those fixes too.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.200]   So I don't, I'm not sure.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.000]   Jason, do you have any insight?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.640]   There, yeah, no, I don't, I'm with Andy.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   I'm with Andy.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.040]   I tried to, I tried to get the words out and know is about the best I can do.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.040]   There are lots of them.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.200]   I'd say, also don't forget, am I on a beta?
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   What's on the beta?
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.200]   And beta getting these?
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   No, it isn't.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.720]   Is it like there's a lot going on?
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.800]   I think the answer is, if Apple tells you to install something, you should install it
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.000]   and just go ahead and install it.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.400]   And this is the alert that there is something for many of us and you should check.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   Because it doesn't, you know, I have to say it does not happen automatically right away.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.800]   Eventually I think they'll force you to do it right.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.120]   I've never gotten to that point.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.000]   I always see a little reminder.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.480]   Well, they'll never force you to do it, but they send you, you know, they'll alert you
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480]   that there's an update.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.680]   And what they want you to do is put in your password and update it overnight, which then
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.080]   doesn't work and it yells at you again the next day to put in your password and update
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.720]   it overnight, which, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.160]   Have you, who does experience this thing where like you defer it, you defer it, you defer
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:07.440]   it, and then like your Mac just starts acting real screwy as if it did a partial install
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.520]   waiting for you to pull the rip cord on the full install and it broke something.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.600]   Because that's happened to me many, many times where I can't afford to do a restart.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   That's, that's required.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.200]   So I'm putting it off, putting off, putting off saying, okay, do it tonight.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   No, do it tomorrow.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.200]   No, do it tomorrow.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.400]   And then at some point I'll get a massive problem that will kind of force me to do it.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.480]   I'm not, I'm not saying that that's part of Apple's update strategy, which is to basically
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:36.200]   make sure that, hey, he can't use the uppercase E or punctuation until he actually restarts.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.600]   That's more of a Microsoft deal.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   Frankly.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   True.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.720]   It only half works.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   I don't know.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.360]   I've never experienced that anybody else.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.800]   But see, I'm pretty aggressive about just going, oh, there's an update, you know, that's
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.520]   why, you know, as you can tell, here we are day after the updates came out and I'm telling
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.600]   everybody update.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   So.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.960]   And I think that's reasonable when there's a zero day when there's a something actively
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   being exploited.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.720]   That's probably a good time.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.520]   Although as you pointed out before, Andy, we're not the target for these zero days.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   Right.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:14.200]   I mean, it's, it's, yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, they're usually when the zero day
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.080]   hits, it's because it's, it's a very specific set of circumstances for a very specific set
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.880]   of targeted users.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.560]   And if they've seen it in the wild, it's not that they've seen everybody be taken down
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.800]   because we would have learned that through a CNN, not through a software update.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800]   Right.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.080]   But still as a, as a matter of principle, it's these little things that will get you in the
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.040]   mud if you keep, give you keeps sitting on them.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.960]   And it gets back to, you know, the, as, as everybody kind of keeps up with this, it makes
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.360]   it not a target either.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   Right.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.960]   Because it's not, you know, the, it, it, it dulls off the effect.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   I mean, if you look at the.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.960]   The.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   The community.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   The community.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   It's, it's, um, community immunity.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.880]   So, uh, you know, I heard, heard immunity because it just doesn't going to, it's, it's
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880]   not going to go anywhere.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.640]   And so it's not worth developing for.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.280]   Um, you see these huge hacks that are happening generally.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.880]   These are large, you know, corporate networks that, that are very old and no one's updated
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.000]   for a long time and that provides, uh, it's worth spending the time to figure out how
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.160]   to hack them.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:20.040]   And, and then as a result, they're very expensive and, uh, you know, you go to places, uh, like,
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.360]   um, Pegasus, you know, the, the Israeli company, which is no, has a different name, but it's
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.960]   the same company.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.040]   And, uh, and you buy those for a million dollars because you're a nation state and you
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.440]   want, really want to get James Bond into your evil lair.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   Okay.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.640]   Enough of that.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.640]   Just do it.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.640]   Update.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.240]   Uh, unity.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.880]   Apple vision pro and apple, apple vision, pro developer kits have arrived.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:54.160]   Uh, I saw James Thompson's post about the apple vision pro developer kit.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.840]   Uh, everybody I know who's a developer has filled out that form.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   Please.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   It's free.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.400]   You have to be a developer, which is what 99 bucks, but the kit itself is free, but you
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.560]   have to return.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.920]   It needs to be returned upon request, but that's not all.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.920]   No, no, there is, there are quite a, quite a few security and secrecy arrangements.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.760]   You must, you must keep it.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.640]   It must only be kept in the place where we ship it.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.480]   You must keep it in a place that is not a transparent cube that people can look into.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.920]   It must be lockable.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.720]   If you're going to leave it for more than 10 days, you need to contact apple and say,
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.960]   do you have any tips for me to keep this thing in its locked pelican case, which is what
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.320]   you're going to be provided.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.640]   You do not show it to your friends or family.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.240]   And most importantly, do not taunt happy fun ball.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.240]   Those are the rules.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.440]   I don't make the rules.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.280]   I just report them.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   Basically they're serious.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.080]   They don't want this thing getting out and, uh, and oh, and the other one is on request,
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.440]   you will return it to apple immediately.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.440]   That's part of the deal too.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.160]   You agree that all access to usage of and storage use of the DK development kit will be
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:01.600]   a private secure workspace accessible only by you and your authorized developers unaccountably
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.360]   capitalized.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:10.200]   What is that some sort of, is that a lawyer thing you and your authorized developers,
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   e.g.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:16.520]   fully enclosed with solid doors, floors, walls and ceiling and locks that can be engaged
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.200]   when the DK is in use.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.960]   Nobody walking in on you.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.540]   You must ensure that unauthorized persons, including any family, friends, roommates
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.580]   or household employees, no evil maids allowed.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:35.160]   Do not access view handle or use the DK and definitely don't let Leo LaPorte see it.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.920]   When in use, the DK should be in your positive control on your big, make sure that there
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.980]   are no air ducts in the building that Tom Cruise could possibly weasel himself through
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.740]   on your personally, Tom Cruise or within your direct line of sight at all times.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.740]   What?
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.740]   You must ensure the.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.460]   I'm looking at you.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.260]   I see you DK.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.260]   You must control.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.540]   You must ensure the DK is passed, could protected.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.700]   Never leave the DK unattended.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.260]   When not in use, turn off the DK and store it in its locked Pelican case.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.580]   That's a, isn't that spelled with a K?
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:14.980]   Maybe I'm wrong in a locked space that only you capital Y have access to e.g. a locked
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.580]   room or closet, a safe or a locked drawer.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.700]   The DK may not be moved from or taken away from a ship to address by you or your authorized
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.540]   developers without Apple's prior written consent.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:30.440]   If you will be away from your workspace for more than 10 days, consult with your Apple
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.500]   point of contact about how to keep the DK safe while you are away.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.060]   You must agree to restrict access to DK to you and your authorized developers and take
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.620]   all reasonable precautions to safeguard the DK from loss or theft.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.620]   But that's normal, right?
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.100]   That's if you got an iPhone 15, you'd be signing that too.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.100]   Pretty much.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.100]   Sure.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.100]   Also, we don't know.
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.100]   It could be Donkey Kong.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.100]   Yeah, it could be.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.100]   That'd be quite a surprise, right?
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.100]   We're the dead.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.100]   We're the dead Kennedys.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.100]   This is supposed to be entertainment based.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.100]   It could be tested.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.100]   It could be a test.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.100]   They send you Donkey Kong first and then you tweet out.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.100]   I filled out all his forms and all I got was a Donkey Kong game and then the.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.100]   He said, him headset.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.100]   Please return Donkey Kong to us immediately.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.500]   Why did you make me dodge flaming barrels for like for 10 minutes?
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:19.860]   We just want to make sure you were very, very serious about wanting to develop the
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.860]   R apps.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:21.860]   Exactly.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:30.420]   I saw Matthew Castellini say, does shortcut developers count?
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.660]   Are they developers?
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.620]   You have to be a developer, right?
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.900]   Yeah, and how many of them?
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.860]   I mean, like even somebody like David Smith or James Thompson is an indie developer who's
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.460]   just a single developer.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.460]   Are they?
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.740]   How many of these do they have, right?
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:51.420]   Do you really need to be at a very high kind of like level of revenue in order to get
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.420]   this?
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.300]   Then again, I mean, this is, I know we're going to talk about in a little bit Mark Gurman's
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.900]   story about, you know, what's the developer market for Vision Pro apps and who's going
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.500]   to be interested in developing for it.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:07.700]   But the fact is Apple does benefit from people like any developers like James and David Smith
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.060]   to do showcase apps, even if they are just these indie apps, they, they make the platform
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.060]   cooler.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.460]   So I just, I'm going to be, it'll be interesting.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.820]   Can they even admit that they have it?
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.180]   It'll be interesting to find out in the end when they write their memoirs who actually
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.180]   got one.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.540]   Well, and also I, you know, this is, this is why some developers are pretty careful about
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.900]   what they say in public because of course this is all subjective as well.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.260]   Like I don't think that sending a bunch of heads is probably not going to epic.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:40.380]   It's amazing that James Thompson gets any promotion for Apple all given.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.340]   He talks about this stuff and complains and gets rejected and stuff like that.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:50.020]   But he does, he also does good work and, and embraces Apple's new technologies and that's,
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.300]   you know, that's part of the secret sauce with any, any of those indie developers is you
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.940]   may say, Oh, indie developers are small and they don't matter.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.500]   But they do, they bring a cache to the platform that Apple really likes.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.580]   So they're definitely a part of the, of the Gestalt of any new platform.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.580]   They're just kind of as a side thing.
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.780]   Unity has also shipped its beta version of its development.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.780]   Super smart by unity.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.780]   I think that they, so that development, I believe that they've put out a sample, you
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:26.620]   know, a sample app that you can kind of tear apart as a developer and unity should be doubling
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.620]   down on this.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.140]   This is their moment, you know, to, to take advantage of this.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.740]   And so I, you know, if they're smart, there's going to be tons of education.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.660]   There's going to be tons of, of outreach.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.220]   There's going to be tons of example files.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.740]   They're going to build all these things out because, you know, Apple right now, I think
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.660]   is kind of filling a gap with unity.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:48.100]   And the key is just to take advantage of that gap and really make sure that a lot of developers
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.460]   are considering their platform to use it because you can't do everything you need to do in
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.900]   the core Apple development tools just yet.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.660]   And so I think that's it.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.180]   It'd be, it really behooves unity to jump on this.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.740]   We'll see how hard they, how hard they push.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.820]   It sounds like they've been working on this for years, right?
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.940]   But they're out there now and they're the one.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.140]   If you want to make these kind of apps for Vision Pro, unity is the way you're going
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.140]   to do it.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.420]   Well, you can build, I mean, there's definitely apps that you can build using, you know, the
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.180]   tools and the, and, and reality composer pro.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.020]   And you know, there's definitely things you can build out there.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.460]   But as soon as you start getting into real games or really, exactly, this class of app,
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.460]   right?
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.300]   Because this is the one that's there and the other one is in a series of lawsuits with
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.940]   Apple and is not going to be there.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.940]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.340]   My guess is they've been working with Apple on this for since about six months after that
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.340]   lawsuit.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.340]   Because, because Unreal was in all those, all those meetings before that.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.660]   I mean, Unreal was in all the before, before they did the lawsuit.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:53.700]   Unity announced at the, at WWDC, Apple announced Polyspatial, which is Unity's new technology
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.900]   and VisionOS kit.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.260]   Here's the get started with spatial creation.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.460]   Your apps will get access to benefits such as pass through and dynamic, foveated rendering
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.980]   in addition to popular Unity features like AR Foundation and AR Interaction Toolkit by
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.900]   combining Unity's authoring and simulation capabilities with reality kit, which is Apple's
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:22.340]   technologies, managed app rendering content created with Unity will look and feel at home.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.140]   So sounds like you are existing content created with Unity will look and feel at home on the
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.140]   Vision Pro.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.140]   Yes.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.820]   That's part of the pitch is it's a port, it's for porting as well, right?
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.820]   And yeah, yeah.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.740]   And in fact, these are the choices.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.220]   What are your goals during the beta?
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.660]   Create a new fully immersive gamer app, create a new immersive gamer app, port an existing
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.820]   immersive gamer app, port a mobile gamer app to be immersive on this platform.
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.180]   So that's, that's obviously part of it.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.340]   You know, I think that Apple will probably mix the marketing as they move forward with
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.300]   when they start rolling out the headset of between big companies that are porting an
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.620]   iPad app or porting something over.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.660]   But a lot of the focus is going to be on stuff that's really built for the headset.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.620]   You know, so I think that porting over if you're, if you're doing something really important,
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.260]   you might be able to get away with it.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.340]   But if you're not, you probably want to build something for it.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.900]   So as you said, Jason, we should probably mention Mark Blum, Mark Bloomberg.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.700]   Oh, he might as well.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   He might as well.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.700]   I call him that too.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.340]   Mark, Mark German.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.260]   The porting wants to get on Tim Apple.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:33.380]   He's a power on newsletter title, Apple's headset hinges on apps, but don't expect developers
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.140]   to flock to it.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:43.460]   His contention is what that a, it's an expensive device.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.380]   B, Apple's already said we're not, or as implied, we're not going to be able to make
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.980]   a million of them.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.980]   In fact, the supply chain says it may just be in the few hundred thousands.
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:22:00.700]   You know, compared to a hundred, thirty million iPhone iPads and, and Max.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:06.660]   So that poses the question says, Mr. Tim Bloomberg, will the vision and pro app store
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.260]   be a success?
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.220]   Like the one on the iPhone and the iPad or will it flop like the Apple watch and TV?
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.540]   Oh, I forgot there are app stores for the watch and TV, aren't there?
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.100]   It's an eye message.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.700]   Don't forget the eye message.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.700]   Stickers.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.420]   Everybody get your vision, pro stickers.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.420]   Sticker back.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.420]   They'll float in space.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.420]   Sorry, plugins too.
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.420]   It's, it's hard to say.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.860]   I mean, I don't, I don't think that any developer is going to be wisely deciding that,
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:36.420]   hey, we're going to divert a whole bunch of our budget and our personnel into developing
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:43.180]   an app for this platform that, as you said, might only have about 200,000 seats in the
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:50.660]   entire audience and is probably does probably doesn't represent the full spectrum of users
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.900]   that you would normally target an app launch at.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.100]   You're talking about a really small way to the pie no matter how you slice it.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.980]   And I do think that nonetheless, the smaller developers, either because they're going to
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.900]   be excited to develop this stuff be because this is their side hustle.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.620]   This is their side gig, believe it or not, they are considered very, very successful
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:14.460]   consultants on the side and they do actually maintain one or two very successful apps in
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.460]   the time that they want to use their brain for other things.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.700]   I think those people are going to be the people who do the weird stuff that will at least
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:27.020]   give Apple something interesting to sell off and might make them, I don't know, 10, 20,000
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:34.660]   bucks a year, maybe it's, I just, I agree with the idea that I, that you're not going
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.300]   to see large developers investing huge amounts of money in this platform.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.940]   Microsoft is already on board, but they kind of have to be because they want to put, they
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.420]   want to put office everywhere.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.580]   This is, go ahead.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.580]   I felt like reading the article.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.580]   I felt like it came from an analyst, but not from someone who actually.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.340]   It feels like an analyst.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.420]   Because, because the thing is, is that there are so many opportunities when the, when
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.460]   some, when a new platform comes out, there's an enormous number of opportunities because
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.100]   you have a bunch of people with no, nothing else to put on the device, you know, and they
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:09.740]   just spent $3,000 or $4,000 or $5,000 on this device.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.860]   They spending another $1,000 over the next couple months buying apps for it is not probably
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.620]   going to be a big deal to most of the ones that are buying the, buying the headset in
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.620]   the first place.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.100]   So they're going to be buying, because they're going to be excited about it.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.260]   They're going to want to show their friends.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.340]   They're going to want to figure out what works, what doesn't work for the people who are
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.300]   buying these.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.940]   If they're $10, they're going to buy a lot of $10 apps.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.620]   You know, if they're more than that, I mean, he talks about them becoming more expensive
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.620]   because smaller market, that gets away from the just, oh, I'll just buy it to see how
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.620]   it turns out.
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.780]   A couple of coffees worth of cost.
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.020]   If it got up, I know for me at $20, I'd be like, well, we'll see.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.180]   At $10, I'd probably buy anything that looks remotely interesting, you know, for it to
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.100]   just see how it works.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.300]   I think people are going to want to explore and a lot of companies, I mean, a lot of developers
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.540]   in the past that put out things that are okay, but interesting and made a lot of money.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.900]   So I think that people will do fat, they'll do a lot of work to try to have something on
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.620]   the day it starts to ship so that when people download it, they go to the app store and
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.820]   they say, oh, this is a really cool tour of something or other app.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.860]   You know, and there will be some of those out there because of all these developer kits
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:17.940]   that are going out.
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:23.100]   So there's going to be 50 or 100 or 200 apps to play with day one.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.220]   And I think that a lot of people are going to buy them.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.180]   Did we see that with the iPhone?
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.980]   Because when remember when the app store launched on the iPhone, here you have a relatively
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.380]   expensive device.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.540]   And suddenly you can buy apps.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.900]   We see an influx of people.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.060]   I mean, there certainly were a lot of fart apps.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.860]   Fart apps, flashlight apps.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:42.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.860]   Go ahead.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.860]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.340]   No, that was a prime product, right?
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:53.460]   The iPad might be the better match because that was a brand new product nobody had had
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.660]   and it opened with an app store.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.260]   And we saw, I mean, there were a lot of products that made a lot of apps that made a lot of
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.260]   money on day one.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.940]   Prices actually started a little higher too.
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.540]   And then they kind of like came back down to Earth over time.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.540]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:11.060]   Here's a graph of Apple App Store quarterly apps and games from 2009 to 2022.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.060]   And you can see it builds.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.980]   Of course, it probably builds with a number of units sold as well.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.980]   Right.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.980]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.980]   But I think your point, Alex, is well taken that there is going to be, even if it's only
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:27.100]   250,000 people in the first year with these vision pro headsets, there's going to be a
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.820]   if each of them spells $1,000 as a quarter of a billion dollars out there.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:36.740]   And here's what you're saying is, here's what Herman writes specifically.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:42.540]   He says, "The addressable market for the vision pro is one five hundredth that of other Apple
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.540]   devices.
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.540]   That's potentially a major road buck to developers investing in the product.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.460]   I've spoken to a slew.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.780]   I don't know what that technical is.
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:56.180]   Is that a thousand of high profile developers in the virtual reality space and that reason
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:01.580]   alone, the lack of units has them wary of building an app for the vision pro.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.940]   They also say, and this is interesting.
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:10.380]   And this, this, this may be relevant to the lack of a VR controller means that content
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:17.300]   games on other VR platforms like the meta quest won't easily be able to make the jump.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.020]   One well-known developer told power on, if you're making something for it, either Apple
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.540]   has to pay you to develop it or you're building the app just to create some buzz."
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.220]   I don't think Apple's going to pay anybody to develop.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.180]   That's kind of religious there.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:37.420]   But I do think that there is a, I think that the one place you could see Apple, you know,
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.420]   paying for is like Apple Arcade.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.420]   They haven't talked about games at all, but Apple Arcade hires people to build apps for
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.420]   them all the time.
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:48.140]   So having a solid stable of apps coming out, you know, of games coming out is something
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.980]   that they'll probably, they will design and they're probably going to be looking for
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:55.060]   games that really stretch the envelope of what the, what the headset can do.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:28:00.580]   I do think that there are, it's a real opportunity for the folks that do take that chance.
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.020]   There's a real, there's the chance of drinking a lot of people's milkshakes.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.700]   You know, pretty, pretty early on, but by getting, by getting in and getting, you know,
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.100]   getting ahead of some of these things.
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.220]   Here's the other data point that Mark throws in.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.740]   The track record of meta does not bode well.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.660]   Since meta's VR app store launched eight years ago, developers have only generated about
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:27.380]   one and a half billion dollars despite meta having sold 20 million quests.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.740]   So he's saying very hard to ever compare somebody else's track record to Apple's track record.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.620]   Like, it just doesn't, it usually doesn't, it doesn't line up.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:41.500]   You know, I think that that's, you know, meta is, I mean, I've developed stuff for the,
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.300]   for the quest or not for the quest, but Rockulous and hard.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.300]   It's hard.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.740]   It's unity as well.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.420]   Is it not?
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.820]   We use unity to do it.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.980]   Yeah, but it's just, it was just a, it was quirky, you know, and, and so it was, it,
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:01.420]   it wasn't as nearly as simple as putting stuff out there that, that this will be so, or that
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.420]   I think it'll be.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.340]   So he also says he wouldn't be surprised.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.500]   And I think he's right on this.
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.740]   It's kind of what you were saying, Alex.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:12.220]   If $20 is the new $1 for most vision pro apps, we could see many of them costing me doing
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:18.100]   $50 at $250, especially in the graphic designer productivity categories, games, maybe price
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:23.260]   closer to their console equivalents, somewhere in the range of $40 to $60.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.340]   I'd love to see if he's right on that because I just don't think coming out of the gate,
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.340]   that's what's going to happen.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.860]   What you're going to do, because the thing is, is that at 10 bucks or 15 bucks, a lot
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:37.100]   of people who bought this headset will just knee jerk by the app to see how it works.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.740]   And if you start making it higher than that, people are going to start thinking about it.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.580]   And I think that that's, you know, I, I, you know, at the beginning, like I could definitely
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.460]   see more expensive apps coming out, but I have a hard time seeing a much higher price point
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.460]   than that.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.140]   Disney Plus is already slated to come to Vision Pro.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.140]   Of course, Apple made a big deal about that at the keynote.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.220]   Apple's wide ranging deal with Amazon rights mark problem.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.500]   It means prime video will have a similar arrangement.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.940]   Microsoft and zoom have committed to the platform.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.020]   So that would be teams in zoom.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.180]   But the biggest streamer of all writes, Tim Bloomberg.
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.180]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.380]   Mark German.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.340]   Netflix will take a pass.
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:22.100]   I'm told the company has no current plans to develop a native app for the Vision Pro.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.100]   Not that a native app, but as he points out for Netflix would be anything different than,
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.540]   oh, I'm in a theater now looking at his screen.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.500]   You could still run the Netflix app on it and be looking at video, right?
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.660]   I don't know how this works.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.660]   And they don't have a lot of 3D content.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.340]   I think that like Disney's wanting to be there.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.100]   Disney's got a lot of movies with 3D content.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.020]   I think that Apple's probably going to put all that 3D content in their store as well.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.060]   So you can buy or rent 3D video.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.620]   Netflix may just not prioritize it.
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.620]   And that's fair.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.900]   I'm sure you'll be able to watch it on your iPad.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.340]   But yeah, I think it comes down to do you have a lot of 3D content because I think this
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:05.660]   thing will actually be a pretty great 3D content viewing device.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.380]   And so there is an opportunity there.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:14.260]   It may just be that Netflix looks at it and goes, eh, not enough for us to gear up our
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.900]   line and maybe change our contracts to get access to 3D content.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.900]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.020]   I mean, that's the low hanging fruit.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.260]   I think that a lot of what we're going to see in the first year that's commercially released
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.100]   is the low hanging fruit, like video player.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.100]   Great.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.100]   Wonderful.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.660]   We've had that already, but now we have it on this.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.660]   Great.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:35.980]   Well, we'll see a lot of simple apps that probably will occur to most developers and one or
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:40.180]   two of those developers will be out there fast enough or with enough marketing to have
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.700]   us to success with it.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:47.580]   I think that a lot of makers of really good and successful and well known iPad apps will
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.780]   want to be able to say that we've, oh, we've updated this for a version.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.300]   It's not just simply the iPad app.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.380]   You're using the new vision version of on the outline or whatever.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.900]   But it's just tastes the same interface, but we've added some charms to make it a little
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.900]   bit easier to use.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.100]   A lot of low hanging fruit is going to take a long time before we see the sort of apps
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:15.380]   that justify, I'm not talking about the expense, but justify the existence of a platform like
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:20.700]   this to say, here's an app and here's an experience that could not have been done possibly on
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.900]   any non immersive platform whatsoever.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:30.540]   This is why there was a gaping hole in the landscape of what computing needed to be and
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.540]   this fills that exactly.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.100]   I don't think we're going to see it in the first year.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.860]   And that's what I mean when I say that I'm not sure that a lot of developers are going
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:43.420]   to be putting a million dollars, half million dollars, $150,000 into developing a brand
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.320]   new productivity app that they can then charge that kind of money for and make a success
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   out of it.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.820]   I just don't see it.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.460]   What is the fart app for the vision grow?
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.060]   What is the low hanging fruit?
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:59.740]   Well, viewers, I mean, I don't want to do that.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.740]   I'll tell you that.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.340]   They can take them off taking a flashlight app.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:09.500]   And augmented reality camera app where you look inside the room and place props there,
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:15.420]   place avatars there and basically take pictures and direct your own scenes, at least in static
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.420]   form.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.660]   I think that space invaders game you talked about last week where we're actually, I played
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.660]   that.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.660]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.940]   Although you're going around with buildings and space invaders are coming out.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.140]   Although they definitely tell you not to take it outside and not to walk around.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.140]   Oh, that's right.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.140]   You can't do that.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.140]   I can't do that.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.140]   So it's probably...
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.140]   Space invaders.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.140]   I think the bedroom is what it is.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.140]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:40.380]   I mean, I think exploring spaces is something that'll be interesting.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.980]   If they can get the...
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:48.380]   Right now, the new HEVC streaming platform is not really...
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.820]   It's not fully cooked yet.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.780]   So how we deliver that is going to be something people are interested in to be able to deliver
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.620]   3D content to it.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:34:01.020]   So basic video viewers, you probably see a lot of those for that kind of thing.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.100]   But I think that games will be something.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:07.420]   Games and some base educational stuff about how to take something to look at it like a
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.340]   molecule or something like that.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.220]   They're going to want to show those kinds of things, I think.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.780]   The cool thing is that it can respond to...
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:21.180]   I mean, it is really magical the way that when the phone works, it just responds to your
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.620]   space and you don't think about it very much.
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.540]   I just used it.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.180]   I was getting a fan from my house.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.700]   Every fan I ran into in Amazon says, "Would you like to see this fan in your space?"
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:37.140]   And I definitely clicked on it, looked at something, looked at it sitting there going,
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:39.180]   "Oh, that fan's a lot smaller than I expected."
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.780]   And then went to another one, and that fan's a lot bigger than I expected.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.860]   And I finally figured out which ones I wanted.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.820]   But what was amazing was it just did what it needed to do and sat down on top of what
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.020]   I needed to figure out.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.980]   And I think that there's going to be some interesting opportunities there as far as
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.060]   it just responding to those things.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:58.140]   Yeah, see, this is the difficulty that I still have with the Vision Pro.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:02.100]   I understand that it is an upscale version and it's a very apple version, meaning that
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.660]   we're going to do the best we can.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:09.300]   We're not going to make a cheap version of this, especially if we only do limited quantities.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.140]   We're going to make sure that the 203,000 people who see this see that this is the best
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.100]   we can do in 2024.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:21.260]   However, I'm still not saying, "Well, why do you need a $3,500 Vision Pro?"
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.900]   It's a 3D molecule in front of you.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.940]   That's fine.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.100]   How is that not better than three or four or five of those kids in that classroom with
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.580]   phones or iPads?
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.020]   And they are physically in a space together and they can turn to each other and make comments
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.260]   on, "Hey, did you see that?
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.260]   Hey, look over here at this."
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.300]   Again, 3D movies, that's something that we've had for quite a while.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.540]   3D shopping, this has been...
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:51.860]   When I hear that, I'm sure that there's going to be money behind that, but I keep thinking
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:59.500]   of every single ad for every single home computer in the early 80s saying, "And Dad can balance
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.460]   the checkbook while Mom looks up the recipes for tonight."
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:08.860]   It's like, "Okay, you're imagining as a marketing person what you could use this thing for,
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.380]   and you're imagining that that's what people are going to use it for, but that's not going
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.940]   to be what people actually use it for.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:18.180]   Because Apple hasn't pushed...I wish that some company, I'm not just throwing Apple in here
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:24.300]   before, wish some company would say something more than 3D gaming, augmented reality, and
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.860]   it won't be that much better than looking at this on an iPad, and it will be affordable
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.860]   for lots and lots of other things.
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:34.020]   I think I have one of those saying 80s or 90s computer ads.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.700]   Hey, it's me, Martin, the kid from next store.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.660]   Sorry about the road to Dendrons.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.620]   Anywho, Patrick here needs some help with his computer.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.620]   Hi, Mom.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.660]   Now, Mr. Norton Corn, here's the deal.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.820]   You can get our friend Patrick to help you needs at Tech TV.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.500]   All you have to do is watch.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.500]   Ta-da!
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.500]   Tell them what they get, Patrick.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.500]   They get Leo and Martin, Patrick and Jessica and Mary.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.500]   Very good, Patrick.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.500]   And Mrs. Norton Bean?
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.140]   That's Norton Corn, actually.
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.140]   Whatever.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.060]   The screen savers are on every weeknight.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.660]   Perhaps that's why it's America's favorite computer help show, perhaps.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.620]   Get the screen savers every weeknight at 7/6 Central on Tech TV.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.700]   All the computer help you need free.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.420]   No special deals, no CD burner, no legal bloody glove.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.420]   Ready?
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.820]   Mr. and Mrs. Le Port?
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.820]   It's me, Martin.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.820]   Okay.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.820]   Dude, you get me Leo.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:26.020]   I know those of you who are in the club bought ad free versions, but that one you're going
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.060]   to get.
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.780]   You do not cut that one out of the show for the club members.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:34.780]   Oh, no.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.900]   No, it's not a real ad.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:42.860]   That's reminded me of that was a parody of the old Dell ads, remember, with the Stoner
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.860]   Kid selling the Dell computer to his.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.060]   Dude, you're getting a Dell, dude.
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:53.700]   What Andy said about the about what's the killer app?
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.700]   Why do we want this?
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:55.900]   Why do people want this?
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:03.100]   Honestly, not only is Apple's-- Apple doesn't get enough credit, one of its greatest assets
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.420]   and one that it sometimes takes advantage of and exploits is the fact that it has an
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:11.620]   enormous developer community and they're familiar with Apple's developer tools and their frameworks
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.780]   and building apps on Apple's platforms.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.460]   It's a huge, huge benefit that Apple has.
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.140]   When we remember, we started talking about this, it's the DK, right?
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:24.180]   The developer kit and Apple wanting to get developers into this platform and Mark German
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.540]   saying, "Well, are they going to be there?"
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:31.500]   But this is why it's so important for Apple to get those developer kits out there and
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:37.260]   to get them in the hands of developers that are, to Andy's point, not just any random
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:42.900]   developer but developers who do interesting things and know Apple's platforms because
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:48.740]   it's entirely possible that the best reason to get a Vision Pro is going to be an app
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:53.940]   that Apple hasn't thought of but that one of its developers is going to have a little
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:59.140]   moment and the light bulb's going to go off and on day one, they're going to have an app
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.900]   that Apple heavily promotes and says, "Look at this amazing app that a third party developer
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:03.900]   wrote."
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:09.380]   Because Apple doesn't know the whole picture here and the developers can be a huge resource
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:15.300]   for the company if they let them be and that's why I think that having that developer kit
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:19.180]   out there is super important for the future of that platform, potentially.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:24.020]   I'm sure that's why Andy mentioned the Omni Group because that's one of those kinds of
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.300]   Apple-specific developers.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.140]   You need a delicious library, right?
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.860]   That was the one that showed you the new one.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.540]   Yeah, those indie developers don't always ship lots of units.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.660]   The good news is they can often make a living without that because it's one or two people
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.780]   but they often are the trailblazers.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:45.260]   There's a dichotomy in the App Store today too, which is like Apple makes most of its
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.780]   money on in-app purchases and games.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.620]   It's not very exciting, it's kind of gruddy at times but it's where they make their money.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.340]   What they're proud of and sometimes it's like the thing that makes them feel good about
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.540]   their platform is often these things that are coming from the indie developers and the
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:04.660]   very clever and they embrace Apple's technologies with their new OS versions in a way that the
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.820]   money makers don't and like both of those are important to Apple and when you're trying
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:14.020]   to figure out what a platform is for, I think especially important.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:19.260]   I think that one of the things that the irony of course is that when Elements 3D came out,
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:24.180]   which comes back to science, it made me think this is what the next generation of books
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.700]   are going to be like but the irony of course is that it wasn't built with iBooks.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:33.500]   It was built with raw code because iBooks couldn't do what it was out there to do but
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.980]   it was something that you really felt like, "Oh, this could be could step forward one."
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:41.380]   And the unfortunate thing there was that Apple partnered with Pearson and got a bunch of
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.220]   junk that was not inspiring at all.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.420]   So I do think it's important to find things that get people excited.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:54.740]   I think about building tours of really interesting places that you can roam around and see things
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.580]   that you probably won't travel to anytime soon and I think that those kinds of things
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.900]   I think you're going to see, I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:06.500]   I mean there's already stereo cameras on the space station.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:11.380]   There are Apple's putting stereo cameras in their film productions.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.940]   I don't think they're shooting the shots with those stereo cameras.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.700]   I think what they're doing is shooting behind the scenes with them.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:22.860]   So imagine being able to sit at a certain, go to certain parts and feel like you were
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:27.260]   there when it was getting shot or MLS I think is going to be a big piece of that as well.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.460]   So I think there's going to be a couple interesting things that are there.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.460]   I think there's going to be a lot of developers that think of things that we're not thinking
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.740]   of right now that are going to be pretty interesting.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.900]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:42.820]   But just a quickly tie a bow on it, this is the sort of stuff that kind of worries me
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:48.780]   that again 3D experiences are going to be wonderful but you can do that already on much
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.380]   cheaper hardware that actually exists for everybody.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.140]   I'm sure the experience will be much better.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.820]   I'm sure there's going to be much much better on Apple's hardware but we're still talking
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:04.300]   in terms of here is a viewport through which you observe things in 3D.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:09.860]   And so the only thing that was really missing from Apple's presentation was here is something
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:15.020]   we figured out that no other developer of 3D hardware has figured out yet and this is
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.780]   how we've cracked it.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:23.100]   The iPhone had, look, we're doing away with almost all tactile interface, give you a full
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:27.620]   glass interface that can reconfigure itself so that when you don't need that keyboard,
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.100]   it's a huge wide screen iPod.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:34.780]   I realize that this isn't a failing of Vision Pro.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:39.620]   This is something that has just simply been deferred until again, cool developers get
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.900]   their hands on it and find the awesome inside it.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:48.940]   But this is the largest thing that concerns me that Apple and nobody else really has yet
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:53.580]   to basically say here is something that is, you need a very, very specific, very, very
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:58.180]   involved platform in order to deliver this sort of content.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.380]   These are just problems that haven't been solved yet.
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.580]   It might be a display problem.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.020]   Can you develop this sort of hardware so you can work for three or four hours and not
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:12.580]   want to just simply scratch out your eyes and throw this like a bat has landed in your
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.020]   hair and throw it across the room?
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.020]   We don't know that yet.
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:20.300]   Yeah, we've got Disney Plus, they've got 3D stuff, but here's what I'm waiting for.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.660]   Turner Classic Movies on the Vision Pro.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:28.620]   Do you think you could take on with the wind, Alex, and make it 3D?
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.180]   Kev Brewer says maybe Casablanca and 3D.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:36.500]   I'd like to go through the Atlanta burning and have the flames all around me.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.500]   Can you do that?
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.500]   Good news, Leo.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:45.900]   Machine learning technology automatically analyze all films and generate 3D colorized
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.900]   versions that you can just sit there and watch forever.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.420]   At 120 frames a second.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:55.420]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.900]   By the way, that's not a fart app.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.620]   Somebody says in the Discord that that's not.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.620]   It's not.
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.620]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.620]   Sorry.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.780]   That's going to get hard to get out of my head now.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:09.900]   Thank you, Matt, for that image.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.740]   Sorry, but we have a title.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:22.340]   Anyway, so I think that while it does many of the same things, it's kind of like saying,
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:28.860]   "Well, I don't need to buy a sports car because my car will get there into the grocery
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.860]   store."
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   Right.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.860]   That's a good analogy.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.500]   It's a different experience.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.300]   And I'm not like, again, I'm not a car guy.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.340]   I don't have a sports car.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.820]   I don't have a car that goes very fast.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:44.060]   I have a car that I hope works every day because I spend all my money on hardware.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.820]   I don't spend my money on cars.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:53.820]   And so to me, probably, if I had another $80,000, I would not go out and go, "Oh, now
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.820]   I'm going to buy a nice car."
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.820]   I'd be like, "I'm going to buy it.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:56.820]   A nice camera."
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.300]   That would be easy for me.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.580]   So I think for some people, it's not going to make any difference.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:06.180]   But I do think that when you put it on, it's hard to say if you've ever gotten into a
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.500]   really nice car and you drive it, you suddenly realize there's a whole different level of
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.220]   all the things that are made and how they work.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.940]   And then you go back to your car and you're like, "Okay."
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.260]   So I think that that is the level of interactivity.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.740]   So the see-through experience where you're actually seeing what's going on, the interactivity
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.460]   with the scenes around you.
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:30.220]   It's not just the fact that it can do BR, but that it does this AR process and the ability
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:33.380]   to pick up your hands.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.980]   Everybody that I think Jason is the only one here that's actually used it, but it seems
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.460]   like it's a pretty seamless experience when you have that on.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:44.060]   That's not what's being produced by the other ones right now.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.540]   That's not the experience that you get with the Quest.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.940]   It's a pretty immersive experience and it's not really seen through it and not really
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.940]   having those experiences.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:57.380]   So I think it's going to be interesting to see how it moves forward.
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:00.820]   But I would, anyway, we'll see.
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:06.780]   Yeah, I'm the guy with the Porsche 911 in the driveway, aka the Metacuest Pro.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:10.020]   And the question is, will I want to buy a Ferrari?
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:13.980]   I would say the Metacuest Pro is more like a MR2.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:14.980]   Yeah, okay.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.980]   That's a great one.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:16.980]   It's not really a Porsche.
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.980]   Yeah, it's a nice one.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:18.980]   It's a nice one.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:19.980]   It's a nice one.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:20.980]   How about that?
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:21.980]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.980]   All right, I want to take a little break.
[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:23.980]   We'll come back.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:24.980]   We'll talk more about this.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:29.700]   The other five topics of the day in just a bit.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.420]   I though I have to say Vision Pro, sure.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.700]   But I understand the word Twitter is now available.
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:40.260]   Maybe they could call it the Twitter Pro or the Twitter nerd helmet.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:45.020]   If there is one CEO who would cheap out and not pay attention and let that trademark
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:49.420]   lapse and get bought out by some porn company, it would be Elon Musk.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.780]   You know how many people have the X trademark, including Microsoft?
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:57.580]   A lot of porn companies.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:03.780]   It's amazing to watch, but it's just a good reminder that the rich are not like you and
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:04.780]   me.
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.780]   They're stupid.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.780]   All right.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.940]   I have to admit, I know you're about to go to the thing, but I have to say that everything
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.940]   else that has happened to Twitter, I've been like, well, it's my largest following.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:17.060]   I'm just going to keep just going on going on.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:20.580]   Yesterday I registered at Blue Sky.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:21.580]   Yes.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:25.620]   Blue Sky is at this point very Twitter-like.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.260]   It's even still blue.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.260]   You know what?
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.900]   I think the bird's available.
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:36.180]   Just check the dumpster behind the building.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:40.580]   Our show today brought to you by a company I'm actually a customer of and love and have
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:46.500]   for some time when we wanted to create our own Twit forums at Twit.community.
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:52.060]   I looked at all the different things and actually it was John O'Bacon who was an expert on
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.340]   communities, written the book on communities, said, don't even think about it.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.820]   Just get discourse.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.020]   Discourse is awesome.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:05.260]   The online home for your community, for our community, for over a decade, discourse.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.860]   They don't confuse it with discord.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.700]   I often do because we also have a discord.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.860]   Discourse is the forums-like software.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.900]   They've made it their mission to make the internet a better place for online communities.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:21.460]   They've got all the tools to make your online community home.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.940]   By harnessing the power of discussion, they've got real-time chat.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.100]   They've even got AI built in.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:31.900]   Discourse makes it easy to have meaningful conversations, to collaborate with your community
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.900]   anytime, anywhere.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.260]   Would you like to create a community?
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.020]   You really need to go to discourse.org/twit.
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.180]   We'll get you one month free on any self-service plan.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:49.500]   In fact, once I started using discourse and I kind of went, oh yeah, I recognize discourse
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.700]   everywhere.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.300]   Everybody uses discourse.
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.100]   Now I'm using a particular theme.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.460]   One of the nice things about discourses is they have a whole bunch of different themes
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.740]   you can use.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:04.500]   But it is just, and I can speak as a moderator, it's incredibly easy to moderate.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:08.180]   This is where our fans go to comment on our shows.
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:12.020]   When we set up discourse, I was blown away by how easy it was.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.980]   And of course, I let them manage it.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:20.060]   Discourses open source, that was important to me, powers more than 20,000 online communities,
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.380]   including Twit.community.
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.020]   Whether you're just starting out or want to take your community to the next level, there's
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.020]   a plan for you.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.380]   There's a basic plan, which would be great for families.
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:31.980]   It's a private invite-only community.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.140]   Or just any community, you know, a business group, a nonprofit.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:40.420]   There's a standard plan if you want unlimited members and a public presence.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:45.580]   And then of course, we have the business plan, which is for active customer support communities.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:52.300]   You can ask anybody who asked Jonathan Bulava, he's a developer advocate at Twitch.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.180]   He said, this is great quote.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.180]   And I agree with it.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.380]   Discourse is the most amazing thing we've ever used.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.500]   We have never experienced software so reliable ever.
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:06.500]   I have run many, many forums in my time.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:10.380]   And there has never been one that's easier to use, easier to configure, more powerful,
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:14.820]   more engaging for your audience, to me, than discourse.
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:18.500]   One of the biggest advantages to creating your own community with discourse is you own
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.340]   your own data.
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:23.020]   You always have access to all your conversation history.
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.620]   Discourse will never sell your data to advertisers.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:32.740]   Discourse gives you everything you need in one place for a great discourse.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.660]   Make discourse the online home for your community.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.940]   Discourse.org/twit to get one month free and all self-serve plans.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:43.820]   That's discourse.org/twit.
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:46.180]   We are very, very happy discourse customers.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:49.020]   There's lots of less expensive than I thought.
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:52.460]   It actually costs us less than our mess in our instance.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.140]   But we get such great conversation.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.940]   In fact, if you want to try it, see what it's like to be to use discourse, go right ahead
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:03.340]   to sign up a Twit.community.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:05.100]   I think it's just fantastic.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.340]   Discourse.org/twit.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:13.340]   We thank you so much for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:20.700]   All right, as long as we're talking Mark Bloomberg, let's go to part two of his power
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:27.380]   on newsletter, Apple Races to Enter the Generative AI Wars.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.580]   He's been talking about Apple GPT.
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:32.780]   That's what some inside the company call it.
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.860]   It's a large language model.
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:39.820]   They call the framework Ajax.
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:45.340]   Mark writes, "The LLM project is a cross-company effort spanning software engineering, machine
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.180]   learning and cloud engineering.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.500]   They use it internally for employees.
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:57.300]   It helps them prototype future features, summarize text, and answer questions based on data it's
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.740]   been trained with.
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:05.220]   What he does say also is that Apple has not decided what they're going to do with it in
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.020]   public.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.580]   He has some speculation, including Siri.
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:16.820]   You know, neither Google nor Amazon have updated their voice clients with their LLMs.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:30.100]   I think it's because it would be too chatty and boring and wrong and disturbing."
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:38.300]   They did hire John G. Andrea, who is a former Google expert in this area in AI.
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.260]   Germond says he aims to be conservative with the technology.
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:49.940]   Although Tim Cook is pushing for broader AI regulation.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.580]   I think Apple is probably smart not to have this in public.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.500]   What do you think?
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.660]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:01.620]   There's too much for PR hit when things get wrong, go wrong, and they definitely go wrong.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:09.020]   Meanwhile, internally, these AI tools are really, really useful to a large company like Apple.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:13.300]   They certainly are smart enough to know that security-wise, they can't trust chat GPT or
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:20.380]   any large language model solution that they didn't develop in-house themselves.
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:26.940]   And, thirdly, they have to keep hold of their really, really smartest AI employees.
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.700]   They can't just simply, if this is where all the action is, if this is where all the really
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:35.020]   interesting research is happening, and Apple says, "Hey, we think it would be really, really
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:39.420]   great if you could figure out these eyelashes on this picture are not coming out the way
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.420]   that you'd like.
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.260]   We need a new AI model to get eyelashes better on pictures."
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:48.660]   So, yeah, but I want to be able to summarize PROST and rewrite it and analyze large values
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:54.400]   of information and help people assimilate a crushing inbox of mail that they can't really
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.620]   get their hands on.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:00.900]   Those people are going to walk to many, many companies that are paying 10 times top dollar
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.380]   for talent like them.
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:08.020]   So, I would be surprised if they actually had a chat product, but I wouldn't be surprised
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:16.860]   if in the next couple of years suddenly recommendations get a lot smarter, suddenly the option to
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:23.740]   go to Apple Support and explicitly offer the opportunity to talk to a chatbot that might
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:28.220]   be able to solve your problem that's been trained only on Apple Support Questions and
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:29.620]   Apple Support Data.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:34.820]   I think we'll see the MSG that gets sprinkled over everything that acts as a flavor enhancer
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.580]   for a lot of different Apple things.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.380]   A lot of that it's already there, right?
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.660]   Apple has been the narrative, right?
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:42.660]   Is O.A.P.E.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:43.660]   isn't doing AI?
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:47.100]   And the fact is Apple, they built the neural engine into their chip.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:52.420]   They have been doing 60 million scans of every photo in your photo library for like seven
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.620]   years now.
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.220]   They have machine learning AI technology.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.060]   The thing is the chatbot thing.
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.060]   They didn't have that.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:07.020]   What bothers me about German's report is he says they started working on this chatbot
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:12.780]   late last year, which reads to me very much like somebody went, "Hey, do we have a chatbot?
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.540]   They're really hot right now."
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.660]   Somebody looked at each other and they're like, "No, no, no."
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.980]   Maybe John G and Andrea was like, "No, they're stupid.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.220]   I told them not to do it."
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.740]   And then they were like, "Maybe try.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:24.740]   Maybe try a little bit."
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:28.500]   And so you end up in this situation where that feels really late to the party and makes
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.980]   me wonder like, "One, what are they doing about Siri?
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.380]   Like, was that not?
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:33.380]   Was a language model?
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:38.060]   Like you use a language model for autocorrect in iOS 17, but we're Siri and what is Siri
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.060]   doing?"
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:42.500]   And then the other troubling thing, the most troubling thing in this entire report is the
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:46.180]   fact that Mark German says, "Okay, they don't have a strategy.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.060]   They don't have a consumer angle.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:51.540]   They don't have a concrete plan.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:55.180]   But you know what they apparently have is a ship date because they want to ship something
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.180]   next year."
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:57.180]   So what?
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.620]   What are you shipping?
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.500]   What are you shipping next year at all?
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.820]   And that's where bad things happen, right?
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.020]   Where they don't really know what the product is.
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:09.220]   They just know they need to ship something because peer pressure, I guess, they don't
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.420]   want to feel like they've been left behind.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.900]   And like, I think Apple being restrained about some of this stuff and saying, "You know,
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:19.260]   the current large language models are really embarrassing and don't really serve the user's
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:22.980]   purpose yet and we're going to wait and we're going to do our typical Apple thing where
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:26.140]   everybody thinks we're late, but it turns out we're just waiting for the right moment.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.420]   Like, okay.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:33.340]   But when I hear that they don't have a plan but they have a ship date, scary because like
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:38.780]   that's how disasters happen in this industry is you ship something because you have to
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:41.820]   and not because you have an idea.
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.820]   Very good point.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:43.820]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.900]   Is that a ship date to the public or a ship date internally?
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.100]   Well, I mean, I haven't said anything publicly.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:52.220]   But German's report says they plan to announce something next year, but they don't have a
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.220]   plan.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:58.660]   It's like it's got to be hard if you're sitting on this technology.
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:04.500]   You know, you've got it that people inside, I think quite rightly, including experts like
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:09.260]   John Jay and Dreja say, "No, no, no, guys, this is not something we ever want to put
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.180]   our name on."
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:15.620]   But there's got to be a lot of pressure, but Google's doing it, Facebook's doing it,
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.660]   and Microsoft's doing it.
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:21.020]   We're missing the bus, you know?
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.420]   You don't want to miss the bus.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.780]   Even if the bus is headed to hell.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:28.740]   And the danger is, is he being a naysayer or is he being really smart?
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:35.220]   And I think the danger is that it's possible that he's absolutely right.
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:39.060]   Assuming John Jay and Andreja is the guy who's saying no.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.540]   It's possible he's exactly right.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:44.300]   It's also possible that he just looks down on that technology and says, "Oh, no, no, no,
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.300]   no, we don't like that."
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:46.300]   We could do better.
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:50.100]   And you risk missing something important, which brings us back to Siri, which is like,
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.100]   "Okay, Apple.
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:55.220]   Well, maybe this isn't the right thing except everybody's looking over at Siri saying it
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:58.740]   seems like maybe Siri could be better and it isn't.
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:01.020]   So what's it going to do?"
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:07.060]   And I get the, being enough of an adult to say, "We're not ready, so let's not talk
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.060]   about it."
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:09.740]   And that's a very Apple thing to do.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:15.580]   But it does, when the chatbot came up late last year, I wonder, or were they just saying,
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:18.380]   "We're just not going to bother with that and are they going to regret that?"
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:23.820]   It is likely that it's Gia and Andrea because he's senior vice president, machine learning
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.940]   and AI strategy, right?
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:31.940]   So I mean, it's his job is to decide what their AI strategy is.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:32.940]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:38.500]   Obviously, an Apple missed the boat on subscriptions for a very long time.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.620]   They just were like, "They're going to keep on having us buy music."
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:45.060]   And the good news for them is they don't have a controlling interest in that market
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:49.540]   because of that, because if they had switched over very quick, 10 years earlier than they
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:54.460]   did, they probably would have 80% of the market that's out there.
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.940]   So you're lobbying for them to release something?
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.300]   No, I don't think that they should rush at it, I think a lot.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.420]   But I think that there's something, I mean, I use chat-up-y-t every day.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.420]   So I'm kind of--
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:06.420]   Yeah, and mid-journey.
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:07.420]   You're a big fan of these.
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:08.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:10.340]   Yeah, I use both of them extensively.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:18.580]   And so I feel like it's kind of hard for me to imagine how I did what I do before I had
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:19.580]   those two things.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:24.700]   And I use them so much every day that it's hard for me to-- because I'm constantly going
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.700]   back and forth.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:29.900]   If I'm trying to figure something out, I'll ask chat-up-y-t that question.
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.020]   And then I start Googling.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.700]   But what it does is it gets me through that conversation.
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:38.700]   I can't think of the words to use, to search for what I'm looking for, or even how to
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:39.700]   think about it.
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:45.460]   So I just ask chat-up-y-t like I'm asking some person, and then I'll say, "You are this,
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.060]   and I am this."
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.060]   Explain this to me.
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.420]   And then it just goes, "Oh, I got it."
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:55.460]   And then I start searching, and then I cross-check it, and I often find that, again, the internet
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:59.740]   is not much more accurate than chat-up-y-t because that's what it's based on.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:05.220]   So you have to kind of read and recalibrate between each page to figure out what's actually
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.220]   accurate.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.220]   But it gives you a good sense of it.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:12.740]   But Apple could be missing the boat, because this is just like VR.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.300]   This is still an infancy.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:19.300]   So most of the moves are stepping on rakes.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.300]   It's not.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.460]   There's a lot of stumbling features.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:25.180]   Slowly, I think that a lot of the industry and a lot of the users are starting to realize
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:31.060]   that, although just asking a generalized chatbot that's been trained on all the racism of
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:35.460]   the internet and all the idiocy of the internet is not quite so useful, once you have a tool
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.540]   that says, "I'm going to ask you a question.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:42.660]   I only want you to answer it based on information you get from this trusted source or these
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.660]   three trusted sources."
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:48.100]   Or, "Here is the corpus of all of the technical documentation that we have written in this
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.380]   company over the past 11 years.
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:57.020]   Only give me answers and texts that's based on this source and this trusted source only."
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.460]   That is a real power move.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:01.580]   Just the ability to say, "Learn my inbox.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.500]   Learn nothing but my inbox."
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.740]   Then let me ask you questions based on it.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.660]   I don't think they necessarily have to.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:12.900]   I also think that Apple is in a little bit of difficulty because philosophically, they're
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:17.380]   going to want to do that all on device for privacy and security reasons.
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.780]   That's kind of a challenge.
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.860]   You really have to be selective in the features that you're going to be creating if you're
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:26.300]   only going to be doing it locally on a computer, let alone a phone.
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:31.380]   Again, people don't know the MSG is in there, but you give them a choice of two different
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.580]   dishes, one of them has a flavor enhancer, the other one does not.
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:38.180]   They're going to lean towards the one with the flavor enhancer maybe.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:45.220]   The hard part is that I guess I would say that the mid-journey and Photoshop or the Photoshop
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:49.180]   beta are a good example of a limited library versus an unlimited library.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:55.340]   We'll see where all the lawsuits go, but the Photoshop fill paint in and what it'll
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.120]   create and everything else is really cool and it's really fun to use and it's one-tenth
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.340]   the quality of mid-journey.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:05.620]   It's not anywhere near what mid-journey is doing.
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:10.300]   Because it's limited to what Adobe owns or what it's licensed.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.100]   I think that that's always the problem with limiting the library that it's based on is
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.540]   that you're limiting the output.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.380]   I think that that's going to be the challenge for Apple is they definitely don't want to
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.140]   just give you this unlimited thing, but is it really going to work?
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.700]   I think that they could through licensing, through a lot of things.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:29.980]   If it just went through all the encyclopedias and all of the things that Apple can afford
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:36.220]   to pay for to Andy's point, Apple could build all trusted sources and then I'm asking questions.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.420]   But I do it now with my phone.
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:44.820]   I'm on chat, GPT on my phone and I'll ask it things while I'm somewhere.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:50.980]   I do want to just be able to say, "Hey, whatever, what is this?
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.980]   What am I looking at?"
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.980]   Or, "What is that?"
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.860]   If I point at a plant, "What is that?
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:55.860]   And where does it grow?
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.860]   And what does it do?"
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.940]   And have it just answer the questions would be really powerful.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.900]   Like it, you'll learn a lot faster.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:08.660]   Just when I was cooking a couple days ago and I thought that, "Ooh, I think some paprika
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.140]   would work really, really well in this dish."
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:15.060]   And I would have given anything for it that time to simply ask the smart speaker in my
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:22.460]   kitchen, "Hey, Shlomo, if I'm using paprika, should I add it at the beginning of a 30-minute
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.260]   simmer or spice it at the end?"
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.580]   And for it to find that information and get it back to me, that would be quite wonderful.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:31.820]   I would just like to ask you where the hell my paprika is.
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.780]   Is Domino still open?
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:41.980]   This is an interesting challenge for Apple because the Apple Playbook, of course, as it
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:49.540]   was with the iPod, the iPhone, everything they've done, even the Vision Pro is to let
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:55.180]   the market simmer with early products until it becomes clear what directions to take and
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:00.180]   where Apple can add value and then release a product later in the lifecycle.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.820]   The problem with AI, though, is not any one thing.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:08.500]   I really like your idea of taking Encyclopaedia Britannica and the world book and a bunch
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:12.460]   of vetted quality sources, just ingesting them.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:16.700]   Apple could make the next Wikipedia, couldn't it?
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.740]   But reliable, right?
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:23.500]   And not prone to the political fights and so forth that Wikipedia is prone to.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:28.460]   Although, in a real-time data sort of way, Wikipedia oftentimes is more accurate than
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:29.500]   most of the other things that you can do.
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.580]   That's the challenge, right?
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:35.420]   So how would you, you know, you could take in all the existing vetted material, but how
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.180]   do you keep it up to date?
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.180]   Is it really interesting?
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.380]   I would say that I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I would give the Wikipedia media, or whether
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.380]   the foundation, ton more money.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.380]   You know, like just a billion dollars.
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.380]   I give them a hundred.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.180]   I give them as much as I can afford every month.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.180]   But Apple doesn't need to create a fact source of its own, right?
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.660]   Like Apple needs to pay for some sources and use those as data sources.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:01.180]   Yeah, I think that that is the future for Wikipedia, actually.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.180]   What is it?
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.780]   I think it's the future for other, other data sources like Encyclopedia's and news organizations,
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:06.780]   right?
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.380]   You pay the AP or Reuters or whoever.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.260]   For access not to republish, I mean, they do some of that.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.260]   What's the corpus?
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:18.260]   But to use it as their corpus of current events for their search engine and even link out and
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:21.140]   say, if you want to read more, go here.
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:23.700]   And that's a pretty good model, right?
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:28.380]   As a trust database for this kind of search engine.
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:35.980]   Andy, how much would you pay for a cookbook LLM that had ingested the top 5,000 cookbooks
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:36.980]   in the world?
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:41.060]   And so, you know, knew everything there is to know about paprika.
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.340]   I would pay a lot for that.
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:46.580]   You know, especially if it was a nice recipe, you know, take paprika and I would be happy
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.580]   with just the LLM.
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:51.500]   And the LLM pointed at the modernist cookbook.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:55.860]   That's like, yeah, I have, I think I have all of those and there's like 12, you know,
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.860]   there you go.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:57.860]   All you use of it.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:58.860]   Just pointed all of that.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:05:59.860]   Those are the opportunities.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.860]   They're niche opportunities.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:04.020]   They're not like, you know, Siri, they're niche opportunities.
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:09.620]   Although, boy, I'd love to see Siri have these additional skills added in.
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.620]   That would be very interesting.
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:15.980]   So in other words, there are places Apple could use this without the risks of the internet
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:18.180]   trained LLM's like chat GPT.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:24.820]   That's why I wouldn't be shocked if they did release this as a consumer facing thing.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:29.620]   I wouldn't be surprised if it was something like Siri where it's not.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.620]   They're going to focus on safety, aren't they?
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.900]   No, no, I meant in the sense that it is a sticker that they put on a whole bunch of different
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.780]   things and they indicate, hey, this is an active voice agent.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:47.180]   So the basic say, hey, now Apple mail is now enhanced with Schmingy brain.
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.220]   I don't know whatever.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:55.100]   And now when you have your, if you're having, if you have an outline for your presentation,
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:57.300]   but you don't have like a, you need a slide deck immediately.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.460]   Hey, Schmingy brain, go to the Schmingy brain feature inside keynote and it will create
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.980]   a slide deck based on this outline.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.740]   It will generate artwork that's appropriate to each.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.220]   It will fill out the text.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.100]   And it'll be called Siri.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:17.700]   I would love to see what if Apple ingested IMDB and every movie ever made and then gave
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:22.980]   you a vision pro app that you could say, Hey, I remember Humphrey Bogart in front of a plane
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.380]   saying goodbye to Ingrid Bergman.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.900]   Do you, what was that scene?
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.860]   And then it pulled it up.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:30.860]   We have that out.
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:31.860]   Technology.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.260]   It's called, it's called watching any movie with your mom.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:40.220]   I'm sorry, I'm not a minute and then it calls the 911 and says, I think Leo hit his head
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.140]   because he doesn't remember Casablanca anymore.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:45.420]   Was that, was that guy in that movie with that lady?
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.140]   She was used to be on the TV show.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.140]   She used to drink coffee.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:50.060]   You can do that with music now, by the way.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.060]   You can go.
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.060]   What's the song?
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.060]   Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:55.220]   And sometimes they'll get it right.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:08:00.460]   So, oh, did you know Google Google search will even do, I forget which app it is.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.020]   I think it's a Google like search thing where you can say the album where.
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:09.700]   Yeah, it's a pool and there's the baby and I don't, and it's underwater.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.500]   And they'll say playing never mind.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.500]   Yeah, I know.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.500]   Right.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.500]   Exactly.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.500]   I think that's so cool.
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:18.940]   There's, there's the real uses there in constrained data sources.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:20.820]   So you don't have the hallucination.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:23.940]   You don't have the misinformation and.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:24.940]   It's a disadvantage.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.580]   It's what we want, right?
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.980]   Which is what Siri was always supposed to be intelligent assistant.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:32.380]   I don't know how to get this thing, but you know you're an expert in that.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:35.500]   And then, and then you use the large language model just to talk back and forth.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.340]   So it's like I'm talking to somebody who understands me, but it's not confabulating
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:42.340]   like an invented album that didn't ever exist.
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:43.940]   It's going to the source.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.100]   It knows how to search that.
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.740]   It knows how to summarize that.
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:47.740]   Like that's, that's the dream.
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:52.060]   And I hope they are working on that at Apple and it may just be that, you know, what they've
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.500]   said is like chatbot is the wrong way to think about.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.500]   Yes.
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.180]   LLM chatbot is not the right way to think about that.
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.180]   It's a toy.
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.540]   And yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:03.500]   But I also understand why they would be feeling the pressure to announce something because,
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:08.100]   you know, they, they, they don't want to feel like they're behind, but it's also not.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.620]   Well, they could do a Google does it and never release it.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.820]   You know, that's always that.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.820]   Let's not stop all that.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:14.820]   Do that.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:20.860]   Google has announced where they had glasses that would translate as you're talking to
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:24.740]   somebody in another language and they never did that.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.140]   They just talked about it.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:33.260]   Yeah, they were, they bought a very promising augmented reality I glass company that made
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.740]   a very nice pair of eyeglasses.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.060]   You could buy actually at a, at an eyeglass store.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:42.780]   That would be just a simple one way communication between your phone and this thing, getting
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:43.780]   notification stuff.
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:47.900]   And it was lovely, but Google bought it and made used to use the company to make this
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:53.980]   demo and then said, enjoy your hope you enjoyed your free cat string orientation to your
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:54.980]   members.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:55.980]   Hi.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.740]   That being, you may need it again.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:58.740]   All right.
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.740]   Let's take a little break.
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.540]   We've got, I think we have some more Apple news.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.100]   I'll find some really well.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.100]   I promise.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:11.740]   But first a word from our sponsor are, are my daily beverage that is such a great way
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.340]   to start the day.
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:19.660]   A G one, the daily foundational nutrition supplement that supports whole body health.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.380]   Like you, I'm sure I wanted to support my health.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:27.300]   I already had a fistful of pills, didn't want to drink some of those things I've tried
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:32.940]   or just got awful through a science driven formulation of vitamins, probiotics and whole
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.140]   food and sourced nutrients.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:40.660]   A G one delivers comprehensive support in one drink for the brain that got in the immune
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:41.660]   system.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.300]   It's like my favorite beverage.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.620]   I look forward to it every morning.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:48.700]   Since 2010, A G one has improved their formula 52 times.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:55.460]   They are in constant pursuit of perfecting the best foundational nutrition supplement
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.980]   possible.
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.260]   High quality ingredients, absolutely rigorous standards.
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:03.700]   A G one has become a part of millions of daily routines.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.820]   The A G one saves you time.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.140]   They save you confusion and yes, they save you money.
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:13.380]   Each serving less than three dollars a day when you subscribe and they make it really
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.380]   easy.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.540]   Just one scoop of A G one and 12 ounces.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:21.140]   A G one makes it easier for you to drink the highest quality supplements and whatever your
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.380]   goal, improving your digestion, supporting your sleep.
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:28.180]   A G one is the best bang for your buck.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:32.460]   One scoop, A G one is a simple drinkable daily habit.
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.980]   So if you're looking to take ownership of your health with a simple effective investment.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:38.860]   Oh, by the way, I love the travel pouches.
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.100]   Makes it so easy to go on the road.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:44.740]   Just throw one per day into my suitcase and I'm done.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:48.020]   Put your day every day with a G one try a G one.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:53.460]   You can get a free one year supply of vitamin D and five free a G one travel packs.
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.580]   You're going to love them with your first purchase of subscription.
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:05.940]   Go to drink AG one.com slash Mac break drink a G one.com slash Mac break.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.940]   Check it out.
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:15.220]   G one drink AG one.com slash Mac break.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.780]   There is some negative, I guess negative news.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.660]   Apple is being targeted.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.540]   It's so funny because the apple can't win.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:28.980]   On the one hand apple is constantly beat up for privacy.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:34.900]   On the other hand, now the EU is investigating a TT application.
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:35.900]   What is it?
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:36.900]   Application transparency.
[01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:38.900]   Add tracking transparency.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:42.420]   Add tracking transparency because it hurts.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.420]   It hurts.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:47.420]   It hurts your little small businesses.
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:53.100]   So we're just trying to protect your privacy.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:13:04.420]   This does seem like conflicting news from from the EU, the French antitrust watchdog,
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.820]   which is L'Shire key.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:14.660]   Give wa issues the statement of objection over apple app tracking yesterday or actually
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:18.380]   this was today signing concerns.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:22.580]   Apple could have breached regulations linked to the use of iPhone user data for advertising
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.580]   purposes.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.380]   Wait a minute, what?
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:29.340]   This is the switch you flip that says they can't track you.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:34.420]   The watch targets concerned that apple quote might abuse his dominant position by implementing
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:40.740]   discriminatory non objective and non transparent conditions for the use of user data for advertising
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:41.740]   purposes.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:49.700]   Oh, I put the nice yellow gazion.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:53.140]   Well I guess I guess what you could say, they don't say this, but you could say is well
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.860]   noticed there's no ATT for apple, but there is for third party apps.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:03.780]   But you could say that apple says denied the allegation saying the mechanism gives users
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:09.780]   more control by requiring all apps to ask permission before tracking them.
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.900]   And we're going to engage constructively with a French regulator.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:22.700]   Hey, buddy, where did this come from for French online advertising groups filed an antitrust
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.700]   complaint in 2020 over a TT.
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.740]   And I guess, you know, it's inevitable.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:32.380]   IAB France, MMA F SRI and Uticom.
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:38.460]   So the changes brought by apple did not meet European Union privacy rules because while
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:42.220]   the opted mechanism applied for third party developers apples own apps did not include
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.220]   it.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:52.220]   So they got a third party, right, right, it's apple and apple has first party data, regardless,
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.220]   right?
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:59.620]   Yeah, GDPR is becoming such a problem for so many people because it's it's basically,
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:04.660]   if you if you don't think you have a weapon to hit a big company with pull out GDPR, you'll
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:08.820]   have some success because it's vague enough that'll probably go to trial.
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.780]   It'll probably cause some sort of a problem.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:13.300]   I do support the principle of it.
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.660]   I do support the idea of it.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:21.980]   But in practice over the past few years, we've seen that the balance of holding large
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:29.980]   companies to account for violating user privacy is happening at a slightly smaller pace than
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.140]   a lot of companies.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:36.820]   They're doing their best being really, really harassed and almost put out a business by
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:40.060]   the impossibility of complying with certain terms of this thing.
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:45.420]   I hope that I hope that gets updated a little bit just to make it a more finely focused tool.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:51.460]   On the other hand, apple is being targeted in app store antitrust damages suit.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:16:00.740]   UK developers seeking a billion dollars plus it's a class action lawsuit, which seeks compensation
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:04.380]   accusing the tech giant of abusing a dominant position by charging in anti competitive.
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:08.660]   We've heard this all before 30% fee on in app sales.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:15.980]   This is the one thing, you know, that Epic kind of won in this in their in their battle.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:18.140]   Actually Epic didn't even even even win this battle.
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:23.820]   The only one the one the one thing in and Apple's got a stay a 90 day stay on it that Apple
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:30.420]   doesn't allow you to put a link to your third party payment system on the web for apps like
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.340]   Kindle or audible.
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:36.260]   It does show that this is how Apple gets picked to death by ducks.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:40.460]   Not not to death, of course, but this is the one thing where, okay, you know, you kind
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.460]   of got us here.
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:46.340]   We're at least going to have to spend a lot of money to make this go away one way or another.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:50.100]   It's this class action suit would not have been brought if not for the fact that it's
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:56.180]   been identified as a as a successful point of entry to get at Apple's wallet.
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:57.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:00.980]   And it's still going to come down to the same thing as come down to every other in every
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:07.420]   other case, which is are other phones like the Apple phone, you know, like are they,
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:12.020]   you know, and if they and if a court decides that they are the same that most of these
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.980]   phones work the same way, then it's hard to calculate them and off only, you know, if
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:20.580]   they decide that that it is distinct, then it's easy to calculate them and off only.
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:24.620]   So it's just a matter of so far, no one's been successful at making that turn yet.
[01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:28.820]   I wonder if in this class action suit, the courts might say, well, the regulators already
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:29.820]   looking at this.
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:34.860]   So we're going to, you know, we're going to let's wait and see what they do first.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:38.100]   Otherwise, right, the ducks can really get you.
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:42.380]   It's nibbled to annoyance by ducks, I guess.
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.740]   Not death, it's just annoyance.
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:46.740]   Annoyance.
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:47.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:52.140]   If it puts pressure on Apple to consider what I always term as not evil motivations, but
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.900]   dogmatic things that they put into place at the very, very start at the app store that
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:01.300]   have long since outlived their usefulness and their sanity in an app store, that's
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.300]   a good thing.
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.620]   I hope that that's what happens.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.980]   I don't hope that Apple keeps having the right billion dollar checks.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.260]   I don't think they're not right at billion dollar check here.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:13.100]   But just as that kind of pressure is the reason why a lot of the developers who aren't
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:18.140]   making actually 85% developers, as Apple says, don't pay any fees whatsoever because
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:23.500]   they're not making enough money to actually start to be charged the tariffs, so to speak.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.180]   And that didn't happen on its own.
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.180]   That had happened because of pressure.
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:32.540]   You're saying, eventually King Farquhar will look out of the tower and see all the pitch
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:36.740]   forks and torches and say, you know, I don't think they like this policy.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:37.740]   Not some.
[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:41.940]   Yeah, it's also very hard to find a bank that will cash a billion dollar check.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:46.500]   Well, you got to make it one of those big, big, big, big, big checks, the demo.
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.180]   It's the oversized novelty check.
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:50.860]   And then you got to wait to endorse it.
[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:54.940]   You need like one of those wide sharpies so you can write your name really big.
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:19:00.220]   Did you see there was a woman claimed to have won the power that whatever was the billion
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:05.580]   dollar powerball payoff and they gave her the big novelty check and then it turned out,
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.580]   no, she hadn't.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:12.100]   You know, you couldn't just check your ticket and see, but no, they got her 15 minutes
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:13.100]   of fame.
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.860]   They got the, she wanted the big novelty check, I think.
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:16.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:19.420]   That cost that lottery company $187.
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:20.420]   She can't go.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:24.100]   I hope they got some of that money back from her.
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:28.860]   I just love, I love the reading that article or I think a TechCrunch article on this, on
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:34.140]   the UK that it said, another element that is critical is that even if the fee was zero,
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.340]   they would still have the same app store because Apple could not sell.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:41.740]   Apple could not sell a single device without valuable apps such as Tinder, Spotify, Netflix,
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:42.740]   news apps, game apps.
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:47.180]   And like, that was like, like Fortnite, like we, like users were just kind of like, oh,
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.340]   Fortnite's not here anymore.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.340]   Okay.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.340]   All right.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.220]   Like, like I just think there was, it was like the thought that people aren't going to
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:56.140]   buy their iPhones because of those apps specifically.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:59.580]   I was kind of like, well, I think most Apple users would just move on.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.060]   Like they just be like, oh, I guess it's not here anymore.
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:05.380]   So you'd have to take them all out to make that possible.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:10.860]   But Fortnite, I thought was an amazingly illustrative thing of the leverage that an individual app
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:13.900]   has because it was like, I had a whole bunch of friends that were playing Fortnite and
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:14.900]   then they just weren't.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:15.900]   And they stopped.
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.380]   And they were like, oh, it's gone now.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.780]   So I'm going to do something else.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.860]   You know, it wasn't like I'm now going to go to an Android.
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.580]   Like that wasn't one of the, that wasn't one of the options.
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:30.820]   So Apple is a little upset about a proposed UK surveillance bill, the government in the
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:36.300]   UK seeking to update the investigatory powers act of 2016.
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:46.700]   It wants messaging services to make, to go, go to the home office and make sure the security
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:50.540]   features meet our, their needs.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:56.460]   In other words, the home office could say, turn off those security features without telling
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.460]   anybody.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:02.100]   Apple says, yeah, over our dead bodies.
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.100]   And everybody else.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.460]   I mean, like everybody else that's connected to messages are just like, well, we're going
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.460]   to have to turn it off.
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.460]   Like, you know, we're just going to have to turn it off.
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:12.820]   They're under this, under this proposed rule that Apple and others would be required to
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:16.900]   do what Apple was proposing to do a couple of years ago, which is to scan content on
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:23.060]   the phone for CSAM, child sexual abuse, child sexual abuse material on the device before
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:27.460]   it goes into a messaging service, which means that they would have to break all encryption,
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.460]   which is no, not that's not going to happen.
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:33.740]   And as you say, what's happened, Signal both have also said, you know, we're just going
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:37.340]   to leave the UK if you make us do that.
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:39.620]   Hope your citizens enjoy email.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.900]   That's all you're going to be using to talk to each other with.
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.460]   Well, and, and I mean, come on, the, the politicians here, right?
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.060]   They want to look tough.
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:51.580]   Let's, let's, I mean, yes, you want to, first off, they bring the most egregious examples
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:52.580]   to the table.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:55.660]   So they say, this is about saving the kids and it's about stopping terrorism, but like,
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:59.540]   it's also about providing the government with access to whatever they want to see.
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:02.580]   And that's where it always goes because that's ultimately what governments want.
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:06.900]   At the same time, the politicians who make the laws that let the government operate don't
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:12.860]   want to be the ones who make their constituents angry because they broke their phone and they
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.060]   broke their messaging app and all of those things.
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:19.020]   So it feels like the most likely scenario here is that there will be, there's already
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.980]   carved outs in there for like zoom.
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:26.660]   And my favorite is for government people, the government doesn't, the government stuff
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:27.660]   can still be encrypted.
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:30.420]   If you work at the government, that stuff still be encrypted.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.420]   It's fine.
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.940]   It's the people, regular people who, who don't get encrypted.
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.060]   So they'll be carve outs.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:39.660]   I would imagine they don't want Apple and WhatsApp and anybody else to like storm out
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:42.260]   of the UK and like, and stay out, right?
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:47.940]   Like they're going to more likely they'll have like a little like, you know, oh, they agreed
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:50.940]   to this minor thing that doesn't break anything.
[01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:56.380]   And that's how we got them to stay because it would be quite a scene and it would be
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.820]   interesting to see it if it happened.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:01.780]   But like that not only would that make the UK politicians, I think maybe look bad and
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:06.140]   be a little afraid, but like they also have to realize that Apple and WhatsApp and the
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:09.300]   rest of these guys aren't going to say yes because they know the moment they say yes,
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.500]   like, okay, in the UK, we'll do that.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:12.940]   Apple, the jig is up everywhere else.
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:17.020]   Like literally everywhere else will pass similar laws at that point.
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.380]   So they're not going to say yes.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.740]   They're going to say no.
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:24.420]   So if you're a UK politician, do you want them to storm out of your country?
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:25.420]   Probably not.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:27.420]   So we'll see.
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.700]   But it's, it's real interesting because they're right on the verge here.
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:35.500]   It's just, it just undermines our, our belief in the competency of our leaders.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.860]   You know, like it's just the dumbest law.
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:42.260]   You get it and you just, this is why a lot of times when politicians say they want to
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:47.180]   make a law about something, you go, well, like, are you really, are you, do you, you
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:51.420]   know, they're just, you know, these are technological infants, you know, that are, that are, that
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:54.180]   are trying to make laws about things that they just don't know anything about.
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:58.340]   And they're being told that they're being given a pile of things to think about from
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:23:59.900]   the intelligence community.
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:03.100]   So the intelligence community is pushing this and they're talking to people who barely
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:08.180]   know how to use email about why, why it's important that they have access to this data.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.460]   And so they're like, ooh, okay.
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:12.540]   You know, like, you know, like, oh, this seems like, seems reasonable to me.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:15.540]   And it's just, you know, and we're, we see this in all the countries, especially the
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:20.260]   five eyes, like those, the five, the five countries that you see most, the most action
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:24.540]   outside of Russia and China, which kind of have their own little world, is the, is the
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:30.140]   Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States and UK.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:34.960]   The Apple says, one, we're not going to make changes to security features specifically
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.140]   for one country that would weaken the product for all users.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.420]   Two, some changes require issuing a software update.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:45.500]   So we can't even do it secretly.
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:50.860]   Three, these proposals constitute a serious and direct threat to data security and information
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:56.220]   privacy that would affect people outside the UK, to which the home office said, well, well,
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.300]   you know, well, well, well, well.
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:02.740]   We keep all legislation under review to ensure it is as strong as it can be.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.740]   And this consultation is part of that process.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.700]   No decisions have been made yet.
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.260]   Round and roll.
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:14.260]   So I think once, once people sat up and took notice to the Snoopers charter, as it's called
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:18.860]   in the modifications to the Snoopers charter that maybe the home office will walk that
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:19.860]   back.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:20.860]   Oops.
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:23.460]   Didn't mean to offend you, Governor.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:32.420]   Actually, a little threat to Apple in Apple Pay, a threat to Venmo and Cash App and so
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.420]   forth.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:37.820]   The Federal Reserve Bank has launched its own instant payments service.
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.340]   It's called FedNow.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:45.340]   And it's free, although the banks that implement it may end up charging you some money.
[01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:50.700]   FedNow is launching with 41 banks and 15 service providers.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:56.380]   You know, Venmo at least doesn't charge you anything unless you want the money deposited
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:01.020]   directly into your account because they make a little money holding your cash for you.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:02.580]   Let me hold that for you.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:06.580]   I presume Apple does the same thing.
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:13.540]   FedNow is apparently just the US example of a service that's widely available everywhere
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.780]   else in the world.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.180]   Canada's got it.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.180]   Something similar.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.180]   France has it.
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:19.180]   Something similar.
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:25.380]   It's just because here in the United States, we have the Federal Clearing House that you
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:32.700]   write a check, buy a stamp, put it on envelope, you mail it, check goes to the bank, which
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:38.260]   then passes it on the Federal Clearing House, where some guy with a green shade and garters
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.660]   goes, "Well, that looks okay."
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.260]   All right.
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:46.460]   And three days later, the money's deposited in your plumber's account.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:49.100]   This is kind of an old-fashioned way of doing things, I guess.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.100]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:52.100]   And countries like Japan have had this since the early '70s.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.100]   I know.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.100]   It's truly.
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:56.820]   It is bank infrastructure.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:00.180]   It's not as though this goes live and a week or so.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:05.580]   That suddenly you'll be able to essentially PayPal your PayPal between any two entities
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:09.940]   in the entire world without using PayPal and without using any fees.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.260]   It's basically so banks can talk to other banks, including international banks that
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:14.860]   have something similar to this.
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:19.140]   It's a long time coming and it's a good base upon which a lot of future services can be
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:20.140]   created.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.420]   I was reading about this last week.
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:27.500]   And apparently, this is part of when crypto started to become a thing a long time ago,
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:31.860]   the Fed started having conversations about how, well, should we have a federal cryptocurrency?
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:34.700]   Is digital currency where things are going?
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:40.220]   And this was one of the outcomes of those discussions saying that it's not necessarily
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:42.700]   that we need a form of digital currency.
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:48.260]   We just need to-- the process of making the numbers in one person's account affect the
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:50.860]   numbers in other people's accounts simultaneously.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:55.460]   We need to make that easier and simpler and make that into something faster and network
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:56.460]   that we can create.
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.460]   Exactly.
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:05.220]   Just today, I paid somebody a fee with the simplest and most technologically advanced
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.500]   method that was available to me.
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:11.900]   I picked up my phone, launched my banking app, and told my banking app to please print
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:16.700]   out a paper check and mail it to this person in this mode.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:19.220]   And it tells me that, OK, this will be mailed out on this date.
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:21.420]   We will hold the funds on this date.
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:25.860]   I'm glad I no longer have to do the 10 steps of where's the checkbook.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.860]   OK, let's write it out.
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:30.260]   But the point is, they're still mailing a check even though--
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.260]   Exactly.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:35.660]   So these are the ability to simply say, yeah, whereas the conversation started with, do
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:38.700]   you have PayPal, Venmo, or do you need a check?
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:43.100]   With the system in place, it would simply be whatever token you need to show to say,
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.580]   here is how to put money into my account securely so that I can steal from you and you
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:47.580]   can't steal from me.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.860]   I do have noticed that a number more and more places are using Venmo.
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:53.380]   I can-- they'll show a QR code.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:56.180]   I hold up my Venmo app and the payment goes through that way.
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.500]   So I think more people want to do this.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:03.420]   You have to say, though, this is the Fed joining the 21st century.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:08.660]   Look at this banner that they got designed somewhere that really looks like 1940s.
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:15.700]   It's a big billboard over a building that says Fed Now is live.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:18.140]   And then there's another building with Showcase.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:24.020]   This is like-- and they got spot-- it's like a movie opening in 1943.
[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:27.060]   It's a pretty savvy sight.
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:28.060]   That's HTML 1.4.
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:30.060]   They're using tables.
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:33.660]   This is hysterical.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:34.660]   You got it.
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:37.420]   This is what they're going to have the guys with the green shades.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:42.020]   And the excited guys do is design their graphics for now, and I guess.
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.380]   Anyway, Fed Now services live.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:46.380]   Ask your bank.
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:49.660]   A lot of big banks are already signatories.
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:53.940]   I see Wells Fargo, for instance, is in the network.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:59.380]   A lot of community banks, Mellon, JP Morgan, Chase.
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.780]   And the question is, well, what are they going to charge you for this?
[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:07.220]   And they remember a lot of these banks also have Zell, which they created to do this.
[01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:09.220]   So we'll see.
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:12.140]   There are a lot of questions about this.
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:15.220]   Like you said, they've already created their own services.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:21.020]   Do they want to switch users over to a competing service that they don't have their thumb into?
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:28.340]   And also things like, how much are they going to lose once when I make a transfer from one
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:29.900]   person?
[01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:33.740]   During the week that that paper check or electronic to paper check is in transit, that
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:39.260]   money is frozen inside my account, and they can still use it for banking purposes.
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:43.780]   How is it going to affect their bottom line when all those transactions happening a million
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:46.980]   times a day are instantaneous from party to party.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:52.260]   People are no longer parking money inside a bank account for as long as they used to.
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:56.140]   What's going to happen when if I get the slightest twitch that something's up at my bank, or
[01:30:56.140 --> 01:31:00.860]   if I just get nervous about the economy, I can take $500,000 out of an account and move
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:06.140]   it instantly as opposed to this is going to take a day or two in order for the bank to
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:08.100]   actually maneuver it.
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:11.660]   I'm sure they anticipated a lot of this, but we're going to see a lot of interesting
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:13.420]   things happening in the next couple of years.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.420]   And Apple could actually become a FedNow provider.
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:19.660]   I mean, they could actually, in fact, I would imagine they'd want to use this.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:21.580]   I don't know.
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:26.300]   I don't know if they could, if it's just what kind of an institution qualifies for access
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.300]   to this network.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:33.260]   These certified service providers include people like Jack Henry and Finzley Open Payment
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.260]   Network.
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:40.180]   So, yeah, I mean, I feel like there would be a place for Apple to play in this.
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:43.900]   I don't know what it gets you that I guess in order to use Apple Pay, you have to have
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:45.500]   the other person has to have Apple.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.500]   Yeah.
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:52.020]   And there's just this idea of a middleman that that's a pain point for security.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:53.860]   It's a pain point for privacy.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:55.900]   And again, that conversation, do you have PayPal?
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:56.900]   Do you have Zell?
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.900]   Do you have a Venmo?
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:58.900]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:03.820]   And that's the reason why I'm sending them a check because a check is not like cash,
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:06.660]   but it's like cash in that I put it in your hand and you have the money.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:09.940]   And again, after another three or four days of deposits, I haven't written a check in
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:10.940]   so long.
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:11.940]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:12.940]   Ages and ages.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:13.940]   I had a right one.
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:17.500]   I had a right one last year and I was like, how do I do this again?
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:21.100]   It was literally like I was like, what am I in my hand as a claw?
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.100]   I don't even know how to write anymore.
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.100]   Yes.
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:25.100]   Like the day to pay.
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:26.100]   I filled out.
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:29.820]   I filled out one form for the doctor and I felt like I could barely move my hand.
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:31.500]   Like all those muscles don't do that anymore.
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.900]   I'm just like, what am I?
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:34.420]   Like, what is going on here?
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:39.660]   The whole concept has totally ruined like when I go to Comic-Cons and stuff, I used to,
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:44.460]   I used to be able to say, Oh gosh, I'm glad I'm, you know, if I could, I really love that
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:47.460]   sketchbook, I certainly would buy it for $80.
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:50.940]   But as soon as I go, as soon as I see an AT, I'm going to go find an ATM and then come
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:51.940]   right back.
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:52.940]   I'll be right back.
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:56.980]   And they say, Oh, I do take PayPal and Zell and, and, Oh damn it.
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:33:02.660]   And I have to say, actually I have, I think that I think that your, your artwork is still
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.380]   on the uphill side of the fence.
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:08.940]   I don't think that I really want to see your naked women doing improbable things with no
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:11.980]   anatomy that I've ever heard of before.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:15.740]   But I wish you the best in your future endeavors.
[01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:17.500]   Trouble in paradise.
[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.900]   According to Wayne Mott, the information he's well connected.
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:28.220]   Apple is struggling with manufacturing larger screens for the iPhone 15 pros.
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:31.660]   Two people with direct knowledge of the issue say this could lead to a shortage of units
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.700]   at launch in September.
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:39.140]   We're starting to hear a little bit about this now because here we are in July and it's
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:40.940]   just a couple of months off.
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:41.940]   How big are these?
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:42.940]   I don't want to be.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.620]   It may not be that they're that much bigger.
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.740]   I think it's that they're reducing the, the bezel size again.
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:49.740]   They really want to get rid of the bezel.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:53.140]   And I think that they're making it smaller and trying to have it not change the form factor
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:54.660]   but have a bigger screen.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:57.340]   And Apple does a lot of things that are hard.
[01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:01.620]   And so that's part of what makes the phone the phone is that it they do can, they do
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:04.780]   assembly processes that are very difficult.
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:10.140]   I remember hearing a story that the, that they, you know, that they had the basically
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:14.740]   they lot when they first made the track pads that were that had, you know, push back on
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:16.580]   them that those track pads.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:18.980]   Like 40% of them didn't make it.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:21.380]   Like, you know, like didn't make you see, right?
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:25.140]   You know, and that was like for millions of them as they went out until they got it sorted
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:26.140]   out.
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.820]   So oftentimes at the very beginning, they, because they're doing things that are hard,
[01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:30.740]   I mean, it oftentimes is, is difficult.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.540]   And we've seen these delays before because of that.
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:36.700]   Yeah, I thought 12 had a similar delay probably because of COVID.
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:41.900]   Also sounds like it's a, there's an LG screen that they're trying to use here and there's
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:47.820]   a process there and they're failing more, but that the information report says that,
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:51.940]   that they've made it so that if they have to, they can use a Samsung display instead,
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:52.940]   right?
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:57.300]   So there's the aspect of this, which is just like, look, they would rather not pay Samsung.
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:58.580]   Of course they would.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:02.980]   But which would they prefer shipping iPhones with Samsung displays or not shipping iPhones?
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:05.540]   And the answer is shipping iPhones with Samsung displays.
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:06.540]   So it's interesting.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:11.820]   This seems like a growing pains kind of thing where they really want to use this LG display
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.980]   but which uses this new process.
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:17.460]   Low injection pressure over molding or lipo.
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.100]   They're lipoing your iPhone.
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:20.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:23.540]   But if your iPhone doesn't want to be lipoed, you know, they'll put a Samsung display and
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:27.140]   they just, because in the end priorities, right, they want to move on.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.980]   But if they, if they can't ship iPhones, the jig is up.
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:31.700]   So they'll ship iPhones kind of in this.
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:36.060]   And it's interesting insight into the, the process.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:37.940]   iPhones are now in a manufacturing stage.
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:44.180]   Wayne Ma writes, known as risk ramp in which Foxconn makes hundreds of thousands of units
[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:48.620]   of the device to test how reliably they can build it without defects.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:54.020]   Apple traditionally moves to mass production in August, of course, shipping to customers
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:55.660]   late September.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:58.300]   So we're in risk ramp mode right now.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:35:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.300]   That's where this news comes from.
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:04.220]   Although our friend Scooter X in the Discord points out a 95 max story that says it sounds
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:09.540]   like there's a story like the next step after the information story, which was like they're
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:16.140]   working on it is like the, this other report is they worked on it and this is from Zach
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:22.580]   call at nine to five Mac iPhone 15 pro production concerns over thinner bezels may be exaggerated.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:27.660]   Well, it's this, it's this update from display supply chain consultants, right?
[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:31.360]   Saying that they, that they solved the problem that this was an issue, but maybe they've
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:32.360]   resolved it.
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.360]   Interesting.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:37.060]   There is no higher priority at Apple than making sure the iPhone ships in volume on time.
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:38.060]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:39.060]   Right.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:42.540]   That's number one job number one and two and three is make the iPhone be fine.
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:43.540]   Right?
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:44.540]   That's it.
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:49.000]   And there's another, there was another report last week about how Apple's basically talking
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.000]   to Samsung and LG to say, we need you to develop a truly bezel is display for us.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.380]   We don't want the display to curve around the size like we see in other, in other phones.
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:02.020]   And we want to maybe be able to do that in 2017.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.020]   Yes.
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:04.920]   And we're actually band warming up.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:08.760]   Oh, no, that's just bikers with my, with my two-state food meth delivery.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:13.080]   That was a a taiko, taiko drummer is getting ready for the big parade.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:17.200]   I, I only, I only start worrying once there's gunshots that I know that I really have to
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.200]   answer.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.320]   Are you, do you argue in a biker area?
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.320]   Is that?
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:29.800]   No, I'm in a very, very picturesque touristy, New England seaside of a quaint village where
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:34.540]   a lot of people try to take a diversion through our quaint village because that way they
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:37.380]   will avoid a red light on North Main Street.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:38.700]   So you want to see it?
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:44.260]   So people, so people are out on their, on their, on their, on their entertainment vehicles.
[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:48.700]   People, people are on the vehicular version of their vision pro displays because it's
[01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:54.400]   such a nice, and they don't realize that there are, yes, we have, yes, we have, we have boutique
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.120]   eyewear shops, we have antique shops, we have chocolate shops, but one floor above those
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.600]   things are actual hardworking Americans who are just trying to make a living in a very
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.600]   cool shop.
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.720]   What kind of shop do you live above or is that secret?
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.680]   I'll tell you that where I, I used to, but, but across the street used to be a hip hop
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:12.680]   dance studio.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:20.960]   And so like two nights a week from like six to nine, they're just be boom, boom, boom,
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.360]   boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:26.440]   And I, and I used to use that kind of like to, oh, as soon as the music would come on,
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.440]   I've known that, oh good.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.440]   It's time for dinner.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.440]   And exercise.
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.080]   So what do we care?
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:33.160]   What do we know about the iPhone 15?
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.440]   Will it have a USB C port?
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.440]   Ooh, yes.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.920]   This your next?
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:39.920]   Yes.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:40.920]   You think so, Jason?
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.920]   Yes.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:42.920]   Yes.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:43.920]   It's the time.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:44.920]   It's time.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:45.920]   Mm hmm.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:50.240]   And I guess that means you have to update the AirPods because it's a last thing.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:54.920]   The AirPods and my Apple TV remote are the last thing they use lightning.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:58.560]   And we'll have to get updates on those.
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.520]   I've heard it's going to look pretty much the same, right?
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.560]   Maybe a little more rounded, but not a significant difference.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:11.680]   And then there's rumors that the camera will be even better.
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:15.000]   Our customers love the phone camera.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.840]   The iPhone camera is the most popular phone in the world.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:21.440]   And we're happy to announce we've made it even better.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.960]   It's one of the most interesting things to look at for the next couple of years is what
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:30.720]   they do to the physical form and design of the phone.
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.400]   Because one of the things they're still working on is they want to put the cameras and all
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:36.840]   the kind of stuff under display.
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:39.840]   And to do that, they're going to have to maintain like square edges.
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:43.120]   That's one of the reasons why they want that edge to edge display because they want to
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:47.360]   lose all the bezels and just basically make this a total glass surface.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:54.480]   So we might see if we see what seems like a trivial redesign to what the case looks like,
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:02.200]   it could be in advance of a larger redesign that again is adapting for a display technology
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:06.480]   that they anticipate they're going to be switching to in the iPhone 16 or 17 and the ability
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:11.920]   to put the Face ID underneath the actual display itself instead of having to have a forehead.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.560]   Will there be an iPhone 14 Pro Ultra?
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.800]   Pro Max Pro Ultra?
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:20.800]   I'd buy it.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:21.800]   You'd buy it.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:24.520]   Andy wouldn't, but you know, everybody else wouldn't.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.520]   Right?
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:31.200]   Well, the phone is different because you can put the phone in a really cool looking tough
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:38.480]   rugged case and you'll have ultra, you'll ultra-vised your phone very, very nicely.
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:40.480]   No one will know.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:48.560]   Yeah, and rest the ultra watch was a solution that you couldn't get without having really
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:52.360]   designing it as an ultra watch from the beginning, but also it was a way to have a different
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.920]   style watch on a expanded line that was kind of looking kind of boring.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.000]   Yeah, I really like those things.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.300]   What do you think, Jason?
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:04.240]   That's a rumor that there'll be a third iPhone Pro model of the ultra.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.440]   Good old Mark G. Bloomberg said, "I'm not sure it's this year."
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.440]   He was one of our best mayors.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.440]   That's a question.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:19.440]   There's a question of whether you go up to an iPhone Ultra, what is the year, what is
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.440]   the feature that makes that?
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:24.760]   Does it really replace the Pro Max and just be kind of like the super big, like the Apple
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:25.760]   Watch?
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:30.280]   You could argue that's just a marketing question, what they call the big pro phone.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:33.800]   And so they could do that at any point if they feel like they could.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:39.240]   The rumor is that the largest pro phone is going to have a camera that's like super awesome
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.600]   with a periscope lens and all of that.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.920]   And if that's the case and it's really strongly differentiated from the other Pro model, calling
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.680]   it ultra instead of Pro Max.
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:54.200]   I mean, Pro Max, for those who don't remember before there was Pro Max, Pro Max is a dumb
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.200]   name.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.160]   It sounds like a medication for older gentlemen.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.840]   And so I would go with ultra on, you know, you're Flow Max is the world that Pro is going
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:04.840]   there.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.840]   So you think they drop Max and call it Ultra?
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:08.840]   Don't they have M2?
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.040]   I mean, they have M2 Pro and M2 Pro Max and M2 Pro Ultra.
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:16.080]   Those are just chips, but like, they don't have M2 Pro Max.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.520]   They have M2 Pro and M2 Max.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.400]   And M2 Pro Max is only available on the high end iPhone.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:25.640]   So like if they took that name, name away and just called it ultra like the Apple Watch
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.000]   feels like a better name to me.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.280]   But the thing is it needs to be differentiated, right?
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.840]   But the reason they say you're pro, why?
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.280]   They have pro and non pro models.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:38.840]   And then within the pro model, they have regular and max.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.920]   And within both models, right?
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:42.960]   We have regular and max in both models.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:43.960]   Oh, we do.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:44.960]   Okay.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:52.040]   So, you know, but, but iPhone 17, Max iPhone 17, Pro Max, you could do it, but you could
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:54.040]   also say, well, it's ultra this time.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.040]   It's ultra.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.800]   It just, again, if it was identical specs to the pro, just a bigger screen, it's not
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:00.800]   an ultra, right?
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:03.760]   So you would, you really want to make it a big deal.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:08.720]   But if it's got the best by far, the best camera ever on an iPhone before and it's only in
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.360]   that model, why not call it ultra?
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.360]   Like go ahead.
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:14.360]   Because you've got some way to differentiate.
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.840]   Also they know that Apple consumers, there's a, there's a tier of Apple consumers that
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:22.960]   will spend whatever they, whatever they get to get the best, particularly if it's like,
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:27.600]   Hey, I'm a, I do a lot of photography or I'm a creator and I shoot a lot of video.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.560]   I've been happy with what I've got, what I've got on the, on last year's best model,
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:35.440]   Oh my God, this one takes it into entire separate, separate tier or even people who
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:41.120]   just want, just like with the watch ultra, I want a phone that absolutely does not look
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.120]   like the cheap version of the phone from two years ago.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:49.120]   I want the version of the phone that everybody knows costs $1,500 and just came out a month
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.200]   or two ago.
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.880]   And that's not in the Apple market.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:52.880]   That's not particularly crass.
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.080]   There are people who have that kind of money and they want that kind of new styling.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.080]   It's a nice thing.
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:00.640]   I think the loaded phone is $2,000 now.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.840]   Like it's, you know, like the, the whole thing.
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:11.600]   The, the, you know, with the headset coming out the 3D capability, you know, even with,
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:16.640]   without changing the lens configurations, you could probably do a 3D version in an ultra.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.760]   And that would be for anybody who wants to generate content that they'd want to watch
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:20.760]   on the headset.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:22.800]   I think that's going to happen either this year or next year.
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.440]   It might not be until next year, but I think having, you know, arming 70 million phones
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:30.760]   with the ability to generate 3D content for the headsets is not a bad idea.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.320]   It kind of makes sense.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:38.120]   It's, you know, for a long time when you went as we first went over a thousand bucks in
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:42.640]   a phone, people went, oh my God, but this has become our primary computer for almost
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.040]   just going to say that it's the primary computer for me.
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.040]   I mean, that's what I spend.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:49.160]   I spend more time on my phone than any other computing device.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:53.320]   Also, it's, it's like a cigarette case back when everybody smoked.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.400]   Like there is something about, Hey, I have, I've, this is, this is, this is, this is
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.360]   part of the, this is one of the things I put in my pocket where I put my purse every single
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.040]   morning after I shower and get dressed.
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:07.320]   And when I, yeah, and when I put it on the desk or the, the, the table where I'm going
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:11.840]   out to eat or the bar next to me, this, the choice that I made and the fact that I wanted
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.320]   something expensive and flashy looking versus something that was simple and practical also
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.320]   says something.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.480]   So that it really is a personal item.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.480]   It's not, that's why I want to repeat.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.600]   It's not necessarily crass to think that there are people who will want like a titanium
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.720]   but something that has like an interesting new design that telegraphs that this is something
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:35.960]   that you need to bring Johnny Ive back as a consultant just to do the voiceover to explain
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:40.880]   exactly the bevels on the bezels have been ground to a tolerance.
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.880]   It's like jewelry.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.880]   It's not possible.
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:44.880]   It's, it's personal.
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.160]   This is a, this is an object that we handle all the time every day.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:53.680]   And it kind of, and it does circle back to something that Alex said earlier that there,
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.320]   there are enthusiasts, there are genuine enthusiasts just like there are people who,
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:02.920]   like if I, I do have friends who have sports cars and they can't, I can, they, they, then
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:09.520]   when they can easily explain why this car was worth $140,000, even though to me, it's
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:13.160]   a car that will take you to the train station and back again and you can get some groceries
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.160]   in the backseat.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:18.080]   There are people who want to know here is how the, here's how the, the engine aspirates
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.440]   here is the displacement.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:20.840]   Here is the overdrive.
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:24.280]   There is, here is basically how the suspension was put together.
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:27.920]   Here's how it raises and lowers itself depending on the road conditions.
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:30.120]   We're asked, I don't care about that.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.960]   But for those, for these people, they are enough of an enthusiast about this vehicle,
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:38.960]   about cars in general that this is a value added benefit that not a lot of people are
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:42.680]   going to get, but those people are going to want to have to, are going to want to pay
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:44.640]   for because that's their bread and butter.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:50.160]   Uh, by the way, the, the one terabyte iPhone Pro Max is only $1,600.
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.720]   So don't get all worried about your $2,000.
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:53.720]   Liar!
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:59.600]   Although there are rumors, there are rumors that you may have spent more because you've
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:00.760]   got it bedazzled.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:01.760]   I don't know.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:06.560]   But there are rumors that it will be more that the top of the top prices are going to
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:07.560]   go up a little bit.
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.560]   So we'll watch.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:09.840]   I think there's some room there.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.960]   I really do.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.160]   There are many great Gatsby's in this world of ours.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.160]   Yes.
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.160]   All right.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.160]   Let's.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.160]   I'm going to talk about it without a lot of the problems.
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.400]   One, one hopes.
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:30.080]   Uh, let's take a break and if you will, prepare your picks of the week or show today brought
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:34.360]   to you by my email service, Fastmail.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.640]   I love Fastmail.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.880]   I've been saying this for a long time.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:41.040]   If you care about email, you should not be using free email.
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:44.800]   You should not be using email for which you are the product.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:49.800]   You should be using email that you are the customer, email with good support, good features,
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.360]   email that protects your privacy.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:54.480]   That's Fastmail.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.160]   I can go on and on about the features of Fastmail because I've been a customer for more than
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:47:59.160]   a decade.
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:02.120]   This has been my main email provider.
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:05.600]   Incredible spam protection that's completely configurable.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:12.080]   They use SpamSiv on the server side and you can write your own rules if you want to.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:19.080]   They have an incredible system so you can actually have your domains go through Fastmail
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.560]   so that, you know, I have many domains and many of them are actually the DNS is provided
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:24.560]   by Fastmail.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:30.440]   Now you can add or buy a domain through Fastmail and it'll set up all the records for you.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:31.440]   Now what do you get?
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:39.000]   Well, the reason I do this is because Fastmail works with DKIM and all of the authentication
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.800]   protocols to make sure your email is going to go everywhere.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:46.960]   It lets you send and receive emails from your own domain.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:50.880]   You can have unlimited email addresses within that domain.
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:55.360]   I love that because, you know, I have a variety of domains for different purposes and even
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.000]   within that infinite email addresses.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.920]   They also have this new masked email address which lets you use a private email address
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.680]   every time you sign up for a product or service.
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:13.520]   If you're using Fastmail with our other sponsor Bitwarden for instance or OnePassword, when
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:18.360]   it creates a password it can create a unique email address at the same time using Fastmail.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.200]   Fastmail of course works with any email client.
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:27.280]   It's true IMAP implemented using the open source Cyrus server and by the way they're
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:31.640]   very good open source contributors.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:34.960]   They constantly contribute back upstream to the servers.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:41.440]   But it also has an incredible app on the iPhone, on Android or the web app which has a lot
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:42.440]   of great features.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:46.400]   For instance, they just added Quick Settings which lets you quickly choose a new theme.
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.960]   You can switch between light and dark mode.
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:51.400]   Change your text size without even leaving the Fastmail screen.
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:55.120]   I like that because I can get the size just what I want looking at it.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:59.880]   Quick Settings also offers options related to the Fastmail screen you're viewing like
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:01.120]   that masked email address.
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.520]   You can show or hide your reading pane.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:06.560]   Switch between folders and labels and more by the way.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:10.160]   Gmail which is not a true IMAP implementation uses labels.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:15.760]   IMAP uses folders but Fastmail has done it so that you can use either which is fantastic.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:17.160]   You can auto save contacts.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.280]   Whenever I reply to somebody they automatically get added to my contact list which then goes
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.840]   back to my filter rules.
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.680]   Very sophisticated filter rules.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:28.640]   One of which is if you're not my contact list I'm going to downgrade your email and
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:33.020]   if you are in my contact my address book if I have a conversion to do before I upgrade
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.600]   your email so I see the important emails.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.440]   You can choose to show public images of senders from external services like Gravatar.
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:41.840]   I really love that.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:45.640]   You can set default reminders for events change how invitations are handled.
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.720]   That's really important if you get a lot of invitations.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:53.440]   In fact I've moved all my calendar and address book services off of Google onto Fastmail.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:58.320]   So Fastmail does notes, calendar, contacts and email for me.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:00.520]   It's the best.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.500]   Over 20 years Fastmail has been a leader in email privacy.
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:05.780]   This is one of the reasons I moved there.
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:08.060]   They don't sell advertising.
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:09.380]   They keep my data private.
[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:10.900]   They don't sell it to marketers.
[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:15.820]   The Fastmail team believes in working for customers as people to be cared for not products
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:17.460]   to be exploited.
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:18.460]   No advertising.
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:19.620]   No advertisers.
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:21.260]   No marketers.
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.540]   You pay for free email with your privacy.
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:28.940]   I got to tell you at Fastmail your data stays yours with better productivity features incredible
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:32.720]   support for as little as $3 a month.
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:38.520]   Fastmail has better spam filters, no ads, incredible productivity tools.
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:39.760]   Obviously I can go on and on.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:45.200]   I am a huge Fastmail advocate and I have been for all the years I've been using them.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:51.600]   It's very easy to move to Fastmail and port your old email server into your in-mail box.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:55.680]   You can also by the way continually get mail from an old address which makes it very easy
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:57.800]   to switch over.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:59.040]   You can also move email forward.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:03.360]   They propose new internet standards and open source innovations that power many other
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:06.120]   email services.
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:10.240]   But don't get stuck with a substandard email provider.
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.240]   This is the one.
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:12.240]   Fastmail.
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:15.320]   Reclaim your privacy boost productivity.
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:18.200]   You will actually love your email again.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:19.200]   Fastmail.
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:20.200]   Try it now.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.200]   30 days free.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.200]   Fastmail.com/twit.
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:28.160]   You know I've been recommending this for years.
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.640]   It's just the way to go.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:30.640]   Fastmail.com/twit.
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:35.320]   If you care about email, don't use the free services.
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:36.960]   Use an email that cares about you.
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:41.600]   Fastmail.com/twit.
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:47.440]   We have some, I want to just quickly mention some big events coming up in our club, Club
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:48.440]   Twit.
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:53.120]   This Thursday, Rod Pyle, a host of This Week in Space, a show that launched in the club
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.080]   and is now out in public.
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:58.520]   We'll be doing a fireside chat with Aunt Prud, our community manager.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:59.920]   We've got home theater geeks now.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:02.640]   Scott Wilkinson's classic is back.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:06.160]   We're looking at bringing back other shows and introducing other shows all in the club
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:09.760]   because the club members pay for it at seven bucks a month.
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:11.600]   They get ad free versions of all of our shows.
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:12.760]   They get these special events.
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:15.600]   They get access to the club Twit Discord.
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:19.440]   Aunt's going to be doing a live photo critique session August 4th.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:22.080]   We have a photo walk planned at the end of next month, by the way.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:23.440]   I want you to put this in your calendar.
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:26.920]   Save the date August 26th, Saturday 6 p.m.
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:31.640]   If you're in the Northern California area, Aunt and I and Elisa and a bunch of us are
[01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:35.120]   going to go down and take some pictures in Petaloma.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.920]   Stacey's book club is also coming up in August.
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:42.400]   And then in September, very excited about this, a fireside chat.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:45.640]   You may remember Hugh Howie did an interview with Aunt.
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:50.960]   He's the guy who wrote the Wool Book series on which the Silo TV series was based.
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.360]   He's a really great book.
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:56.200]   He and Daniel Suarez, his friend and buddy, are going to be joining Aunt.
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:54:02.120]   I think I might wedge my way into this conversation as well because I love Daniel.
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:07.080]   On September 7th at 2 p.m. Pacific, members only event.
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:11.360]   So these are all, we're trying to make the club something you want to be part of.
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.360]   We got the Discord.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:14.320]   We have ad free versions of all the shows.
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:19.080]   We have special shows that we don't put out anywhere else because the club members support
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:20.640]   it.
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:23.360]   I think with all of that, you might say, "Well, how much is that going to cost?"
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.720]   It's seven bucks a month.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.840]   That's it because we want to make it affordable for everybody.
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:32.280]   So if you're not yet a member of club twit and you want to support what we do and keep
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:34.360]   it going, it really helps.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:37.440]   I know we have ads for the non-club members.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.920]   That's how we pay for those shows.
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:44.960]   But ads are a hit miss business, to say the least.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:49.640]   We really like the idea of having a consistent revenue from our listeners so that we can
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:51.880]   make the best possible stuff for you.
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.880]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:58.820]   There's a seven bucks a month, there's $84 a year, there's a family plan, and there's
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:00.120]   corporate memberships as well.
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:02.360]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:05.800]   Thank you for your support in advance.
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:10.460]   That's kind of my pick of the week, but let's find out what Jason Snow has for his pick
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:11.460]   of the week this week.
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:12.460]   I like the name.
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.460]   I'm going for a blast.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:14.800]   A blast for the past.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:17.360]   So this is a classic iPhone game, ridiculous fishing.
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:20.600]   It was a big hit a long time ago, it's sort of gone.
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:25.120]   By the wayside as they do, the developer of it basically went out of business.
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.440]   They shut down the studio.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:32.440]   But Apple Arcade, in part of its attempts to get classic iPhone games back on the platform
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:38.440]   and up to date, went to the original people who developed the game and got them to build
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:44.800]   a new modern version of ridiculous fishing for Apple Arcade called Ridiculous Fishing EX.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:49.600]   If you don't remember Ridiculous Fishing, you cast a line, you're a guy in a boat and
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.160]   you try to dodge the fish and get your line as low.
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.000]   Once it hits a fish, you got to grab all the fish and bring them back up and then it throws
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000]   them in the air and then you shoot them out of the air with a gun.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000]   It's ludicrous, but it's fun and really well done.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.040]   And also just from a game preservation standpoint, the fact that Apple Arcade is going back to
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:13.400]   some of these old classic iPhone games that are basically haven't been updated because
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:16.000]   there has been no business model to make sense of it.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.280]   And essentially, I didn't give money to the developers to update them and bring them back
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.840]   in Apple Arcade, even from a company that basically shut down.
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:30.040]   But the developers are all still out there like Zack Gage, the great iPhone game developer
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:32.160]   is one of the people involved in this game.
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:33.240]   And they've added some new features.
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:35.520]   The graphics look better.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:41.400]   There's a weird tick-tock-like thing which shows people fishing.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.200]   There's all sorts of strange stuff in there.
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.280]   But the core of the game is the mechanic that made it such a great game back in the day
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:48.280]   on the iPhone.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:53.280]   So if you're an Apple Arcade person, this is one of many classic iPhone games that is
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:57.080]   now back in the store in the arcade section.
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:58.560]   So ridiculous fishing.
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:56:59.560]   Check it out.
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:01.720]   I think that's so cool that they're bringing those back.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:06.000]   These are games that resonate because we played them when we were younger.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000]   And slightly younger.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000]   Slightly.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000]   It's just great to bring them back.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000]   Remember the 2010s?
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000]   Oh, yes.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]   Oh, those were the days.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000]   I love those.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000]   All right.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.960]   I'm downloading it right now.
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.200]   Ridiculous Fishing from Apple Arcade.
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.920]   It does what it says on the box.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:23.920]   It's ridiculous.
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:24.920]   It's fishing.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.920]   I hope so.
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:31.360]   There are others that do they have a section where they say like back to the back of the
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:32.360]   game.
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:34.720]   Yeah, there's a revived classics section where they brought back.
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:37.000]   Like flight control I think is in there now, right?
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.960]   Which is a game that everybody loved but it also just kind of died on the vine because
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:44.680]   you do a bunch of OS updates and then it doesn't really work right anymore.
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:47.080]   So they're paying to bring a bunch of that stuff back.
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:51.880]   Plus, new titles and stuff that is unlocked and doesn't have any purchases.
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:57.720]   I think Apple Arcade, they did a course correction about a year ago and it's been a really interesting
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:59.960]   new selection of games that they put in there.
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:00.960]   Good.
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:02.960]   And new old games, old new games.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:06.960]   I guess it's under the timeless classics section.
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.960]   Ridiculous Fishing.
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:12.840]   Andy Enoco, your pick of the week.
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:16.800]   My pick of the week is time to well, Sad Event from last week.
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:24.120]   2009 in January, Apple did their very, very last keynote at Mac World Expo in San Francisco.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:28.440]   And it was the very last one.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:31.680]   And there was some announcements, not a whole lot of really cool stuff.
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:37.160]   I refreshed my memory by reading live coverage written on the fly by no less luminaries than
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:42.240]   Jason Snell and Dan Morrin, in which I learned that they were really, really happy that
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.120]   cut copy and paste was finally coming to the iPhone.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:46.120]   Yay.
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:47.120]   Again.
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:48.120]   Wow.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:51.400]   We were relying on, there was some sort of, there was smaller stuff that made us really
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:54.120]   happy because there was still a rebuilding here.
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:58.840]   But at the very, very, and it was also unique for another sad reason.
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:03.680]   This was the first one that was not keynote that wasn't delivered by Steve Jobs just a
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:07.800]   couple of weeks earlier before this keynote in January of 2009.
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:11.520]   He had announced he was taking medical leave from his CEO positions and all of his duties
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:12.520]   at Apple.
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.560]   So this was kicked off by Phil Schiller.
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:18.840]   Must have been a very, very hard time for everybody on stage and backstage to put this
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:22.400]   together knowing that the big guy was not going to be there.
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:27.960]   But they did close it off in verse in style because as they often did back then they had
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:30.800]   they got because of iTunes being a big thing.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:36.480]   They had access to really good talent to close out the keynote by doing a set and who did
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:41.520]   they get in 2009 but Mr. Tony Bennett himself who did three or four incredible numbers.
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:46.680]   I think that he let off with the best as yet to come I think possibly at Apple's suggestion.
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:48.400]   It is one of his classics.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:51.400]   And so this is, it was of course live streamed on QuickTime.
[01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:57.120]   So go on to either YouTube or go on to the internet archive at archive.org.
[01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:01.800]   You can find copies of it, scroll all the way down to about five minutes before the end
[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:03.720]   and you will hear Tony Bennett.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:08.280]   God, I'll bid for the last three years of his life.
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:11.440]   He was in his prime and even when he was not in his prime he was still nothing less than
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.000]   great as a singer.
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:18.360]   You'll understand why people were so excited to go to Macworld keynotes back then.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:23.400]   Even without Steve Jobs, although Steve Jobs was a very, very big sorely missed part of
[02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:24.400]   it.
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:26.400]   It was an exciting time and exciting time to be there.
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:31.720]   I'm also going to recommend, don't just go, I'm sure that you've heard, I left my heart
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:37.080]   in San Francisco like a thousand times since Mr. Bennett died a few days on Friday.
[02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:43.040]   However, go to Apple music, go to Spotify, whatever, get the complete Tony Bennett Bill
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:44.640]   Evans recordings.
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:51.480]   This was when, he created his own label and he got to do absolutely whatever he wanted
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:59.480]   to do and he decided Bill Evans, the magnificent jazz pianist, I want to basically do two albums
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:02.000]   with him and we're just going to sing songs together.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:07.640]   It's just him playing the, it's just one of the greatest singers of the 20th century,
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:12.120]   singing being backed up by one of the greatest jazz musicians of the 20th century just on
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:13.120]   piano.
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.480]   They're simple, they're bare and they're devastating.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:18.320]   Okay, I'm serious.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:23.200]   Whatever emotion you're having, you'll find tracks there that will intensify it and magnify
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.200]   it.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:27.880]   If this isn't, this isn't, this isn't put on a happy face.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:32.760]   This is, you must, you must believe in spring, that spring will come just as the flower dies
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:37.320]   underneath the snow and believes that spring will come and will bloom anew.
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:39.800]   It was, it's just magnificent from start to finish.
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:43.440]   So two, two recommendations, one free one, you're going to have to hand over personal
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:47.600]   data to a mon, I'm an, I'm an opally to let them know what you're in Tony Bennett.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:51.880]   I suggest that you buy it because it's going to be Bill Evans is incredible.
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:54.920]   Tony Bennett is incredible.
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:02:01.200]   I remember running into him at KGO, he was doing an interview at the radio station and
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:06.240]   I remember him saying, and this is probably right about in this time, he's in his late
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:10.560]   80s, that he still took music lessons, singing lessons every week.
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:12.440]   He says, I'm a guy.
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:16.840]   Women can sing easily, but we have to, we have to work a little harder at it.
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:19.160]   I thought this is one of the, one of the greats.
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:21.160]   I was, I've been, I've been doing nothing.
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:21.960]   I'm a huge fan.
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:26.440]   I bought, I don't know how I bought the art of excellence in the early 80s.
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:30.240]   This is before his MTV of Renaissance, but something about that cassette spoke to me
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:34.240]   when I was a teenager and I bought it and I became a huge, huge, huge fan from that
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:35.240]   on.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:38.960]   And I was so impressed, I was, I was breeding all the, all the, all the dug up interviews
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:43.280]   and all the quotes, especially from his like the eight, the seventies, seventies, eighties
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:46.800]   and nineties, where he's talking about, he's like 90, 90 years old, 90 years old, 90 years
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:47.800]   old at this point.
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:51.120]   And with a talk, they're talking about like future, what are you going to do in the future?
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:55.920]   So, oh yeah, I'm, I'm studying, I'm studying a whole, a whole book of like Ellington pieces.
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:59.200]   I'm like, you have to, you're, you're like studying this.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:02.920]   Like either still some standards that you don't just walk up to the mic, knock it out
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.800]   and then go home and play video games.
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.680]   Like, no, you, you, he's still learning.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.680]   He's still studying.
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:08.680]   And boy, did that show off.
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:10.520]   I'll stop now, but oh my goodness.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:11.920]   What a, what a talent.
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:18.880]   We went to on Friday, we went to see a concert in Napa, a band called Train, which is also
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:21.680]   a very well known San Francisco band.
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:26.920]   And at the very end, they, they put up a big picture, the Golden Gate Bridge started playing
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:30.240]   Tony Bennett and the whole band turned around and bowed to Tony Bennett.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:34.240]   It was a really kind of a beautiful thing.
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:35.240]   That's great.
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:37.280]   I did not, I must have been there, but I don't remember.
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:38.280]   Maybe I wasn't there.
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.920]   I forgot about that to see Tony Bennett.
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:45.000]   I've seen, I won't, I won't read the whole list, but I've seen so many of my favorite
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.080]   acts just by virtue of the fact that I was at like an ample press event.
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:49.080]   Yep.
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.560]   And seeing, seeing you two do like a five song set in front of a hundred and fifty people
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:58.960]   seeing, seeing Foo Fighters do an entire set in front of 800 people in a small theater.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:04.360]   And then like realizing, oh, I'm, I'm, I just jostled Mr. Pat Smear.
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:05.360]   And I don't know.
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:06.360]   It's pretty amazing.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:09.280]   And I want to, I want to tell him how, how incredibly he was.
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:13.040]   He's been like pre Foo Fighters and post Foo Fighters, but I don't know whether I call
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:15.600]   him Mr. Smear or Pat or whatever.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:18.720]   I don't want to put on errors for Mr. Smear.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:21.440]   Mr. Alex Lindsay, pick of the week.
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:26.200]   When do we, when do we actually call Pat and say it's me?
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:30.720]   It's not allowed to just tell him it's me.
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:34.560]   What is it like he has a thousand friends?
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:35.920]   Thank you for getting that reference.
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:36.920]   Thank you.
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:37.920]   That's a true friend.
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:45.040]   Anyway, I ran into this accidentally over the weekend and was just kind of blown away.
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:49.480]   There's this, I don't know about the magazine, but there is a YouTube channel called Mother
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:50.480]   Grid.
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:52.640]   And if you're into doing what I do, it's really cool.
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:57.920]   So Mother Grid magazine, it is a breakdown and specifically the video I would watch is
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:02.240]   they break down the Metallica, the Metallica tour that's going on right now and just the
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:03.920]   tech that it takes to get it done.
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.640]   So it's not the tour itself.
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:08.680]   It is the guys in the back talking about it.
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:15.360]   He was like, well, we've got 192 audio channels, 192 audio channels for the concert.
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:18.120]   And he goes, that may seem like a lot, but you remember there's four drum sets and each
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:20.800]   one has 30 channels, like 30 mics.
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:25.120]   And so you just get the scale at which these things run.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:33.000]   And so I would, it's a, well, if you do what I do, if you do production, like event production,
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.320]   I started going through the channel and I was like, oh, this is pretty nifty.
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:40.760]   Like there's a lot of data, some stuff that I would know, some stuff like they were using
[02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:43.080]   an audio pipeline that I'm not familiar with.
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.560]   So I was like, now I have to study.
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:47.360]   And so it's pretty slick.
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:51.000]   So I would, I would, I would highly recommend it.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.200]   The other thing that I know we just talked about music, but I was going to throw it in
[02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:55.200]   there.
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:06:00.280]   I just saw, I don't go to concerts much anymore, but I actually went to see a band that I hadn't
[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:06.200]   seen in probably 20 years and toad the wet sprocket.
[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:07.520]   Oh my God.
[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:08.520]   There's a name.
[02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:09.520]   Played at Hot Monk.
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:10.520]   Good place to see.
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:11.520]   Yeah.
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:12.520]   I went to that concert.
[02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:13.520]   Jason was there too.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:18.000]   Well, they were, I think they played two nights, but I went to one of them.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.200]   You go to one last week or two weeks or two weeks ago.
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:22.200]   Yeah.
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:23.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:30.000]   So the, so the one last Thursday or last Wednesday was the last, did they give you one of these?
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.000]   Did you get one?
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000]   I've got it.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.000]   It's right over there.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.200]   Posting and the jam bar, the jam bar is actually pretty good.
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:40.040]   They play, it was the last show of the con of the, of the tour.
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:43.840]   I'm sure it was, I'm sure both shows are really great.
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:44.840]   Just such a great band.
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:49.520]   You know, Glenn is such a great guy, you know, just, just the lead singer and did they play,
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:52.000]   did he play Mercy Street on your concert?
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000]   No.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000]   Wow.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.760]   He has sprinkled it.
[02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:58.200]   You can find one version of it on YouTube.
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:01.440]   If you searched, he played it, I think in January, he played it.
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:05.960]   I saw him play it by himself a couple of years ago and, or a year ago.
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:10.400]   And anyway, I'm big toad what you got to tell us about this before the event, not after
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:11.400]   the event.
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:12.840]   I'm going to go.
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:16.000]   I should have, I should have, you know, the, it was, it was sold out.
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000]   Oh, I bet it was.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000]   It was.
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.320]   Hotbox, a tiny little venue.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:22.000]   You could stand right there on the, practically on the stage.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.200]   You can get right up there.
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:24.200]   Yeah.
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:30.800]   It was a really, really, really great show and, yeah, he's played this, you know, and,
[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:35.720]   and anyway, they have a great, there's a company that's doing like a lot of PR so that Hot
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:39.640]   Monk has become this like the outdoor theater all summer playing a lot of great stuff.
[02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:41.360]   But anyway, I told the West Brocket's great.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:43.840]   They played when I was 30 years ago and I worked at a radio station.
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:44.840]   They played outside.
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.440]   We didn't have any permits.
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:50.320]   We just built a stage and put some speakers up and they played.
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:51.800]   And I remember it got really cold.
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:56.040]   It was 70 degrees, it was on June in Pittsburgh, which should be very hot.
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:59.520]   It was 70 degrees on Monday and on Tuesday, it was 40 degrees on an eight and then it
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:02.720]   was 70 degrees again on Wednesday and of course they played on Tuesday.
[02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:03.720]   And it was funny.
[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:07.200]   I had, I had the opportunity to have lunch with Glenn on, on last week.
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:10.960]   And I said, you know, the first time we met, I, you know, you were playing at this radio
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.760]   station, it got really cold and he goes, yeah, my mantle in brook.
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:14.760]   He remembers it.
[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:15.760]   He remembers it.
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:18.800]   It was so cold, you know, like, like, it was a little bit of a pop.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.800]   Wow.
[02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:22.400]   You know, it was so cold and so if you know what I mean.
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.400]   Yeah.
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:29.920]   So anyway, so that yeah, the really, really great band, I would highly recommend, you
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:30.920]   know, checking them out.
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:34.400]   I just forgot how much I love that band until I saw them again.
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:38.280]   I mean, I listened to them relatively often, but I just hadn't seen them live and they're
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:39.360]   just a really great live band.
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:40.360]   So if you see them, they're all.
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:41.840]   What's the name come from?
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:43.760]   I think it comes from Monty Python.
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:44.760]   Yeah.
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:45.760]   It's a Monty Python.
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:48.960]   It's a reference in a Monty Python sketch and there's a story about how Eric Eidl was in
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:54.080]   Taxi Cab in New York City and a song finished playing and the DJ said that was toad the
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:56.920]   wet sprocket and he went, what, what?
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:57.920]   What?
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:00.280]   He didn't know there was a band.
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:01.720]   Now it's a band?
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:02.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.560]   That's fantastic.
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:07.640]   So well, there you go.
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:15.880]   But the pick is Mother Grids and their YouTube channel, YouTube.com at mother grid Mag- magazine.
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:18.840]   If you want to, I guess you could just search for mother grid.
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.280]   Event technology news and documentation.
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:23.480]   It's really, it's really good.
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:24.480]   It's not sure.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:27.240]   And that's why it's a little strange.
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:28.280]   Some of it is in German.
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:31.040]   So, so it is, so, so not all of it though.
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:36.200]   And that's probably why I hadn't seen it before, but you could, if you're into events
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:41.120]   and especially big concerts, you can learn a lot, you know, watching how these things
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:42.720]   get built up.
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:44.520]   I think I always think that's fascinating.
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.360]   The behind the scenes stuff.
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.360]   It's kind of amazing.
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:50.720]   Thank you, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:54.440]   Go to officehours.global if you find all of this stuff interesting.
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:10:00.440]   That's a place you can talk about production to your heart's content.
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:04.040]   Today's show just a general Q&A, but you can join the Zoom.
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:06.360]   There's an invitation form there.
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:13.120]   So you can join the Zoom or just watch them on YouTube or at officehours.global.ai productivity
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:15.160]   yesterday.
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:16.880]   Game sound tomorrow.
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:17.880]   Wow, you guys just talking.
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:19.600]   Yeah, we, Rob Bridget is coming on.
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:21.720]   Rob Bridget is like when it comes to the game sound.
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:23.480]   He's a big deal.
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:24.480]   Nice.
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:28.640]   And he just finished a book on it and he's worked closely with Dolby and so he's done
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:32.600]   and he's a really, really one of the world experts in game, game audio.
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:35.920]   And what are Bermerang carnés when they're at home?
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:36.920]   What is that?
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:40.200]   So, when it's coming up Friday, come on.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:43.680]   It sounds like to the wet sprocket, actually.
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:47.160]   So when you take a lot of gear, so if you're taking a couple hundred thousand dollars a
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:52.440]   year out of the country, what you don't want to do is pay for the import duties when you
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.840]   bring it to France or Germany or England or Japan or whatever.
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:00.760]   So you have carnés and these carnés are, you have to fill out these carnés that say,
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:04.280]   I'm only bringing this in temporarily.
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:08.280]   And it's a process and we've used, obviously, Pixelcore used them extensively.
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:09.280]   We used them.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:12.520]   We probably worked with Bermerang maybe once a week because we were moving so much gear
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:14.560]   in and out of the country all the time.
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:16.880]   And so, and I just thought it'd be fun.
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:20.760]   I think that it's important for building every time we brought somebody in, we were like,
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:23.520]   okay, now we're going to have, we're going to do a carné.
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:24.520]   And this is how our carné works.
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:26.080]   And you have to keep all the serial numbers.
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:28.120]   And this is why this is, we send it over.
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:32.640]   So a lot of times we, you know, we like, we can talk about things in office hours for
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:33.800]   a very long time.
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:38.360]   Like we, Friday, I mean, we had one where we did a whole hour on gaff tape.
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:40.760]   And on Friday, we just had a whole hour.
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:41.760]   Oh my God, a whole hour?
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:43.360]   Well, not on Friday, but we did.
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:44.360]   We did a year ago.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.200]   And the whole hour on different kinds of gaff tape and how we gaff tape and what do we,
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.520]   how we use it and everything else.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:53.040]   On Friday, we just did load in, load out, like literally is an hour of how we load in
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:56.080]   and how we load out of venues.
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:01.040]   In this case, this is, I just feel like for people who haven't done a carné yet, this
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:02.040]   is something that they need to understand.
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:04.400]   Every single thing you never need to know.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.400]   And I love it.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:06.400]   You just put it there.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:07.400]   You don't explain it.
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:10.320]   You just put the title is, "Boom Rancarné."
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:11.320]   You'll know if you need it.
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:12.320]   If you need it.
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:16.920]   There's a little slightly more description in the emails that people get.
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:18.400]   So we send emails every day.
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:20.320]   If you go to a website and that's a good idea.
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:23.440]   If the emails that you get, you get a little more description of what it is.
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:26.840]   Because I think they, I think in the email, you get like all these links to all the different
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:31.120]   websites, links, resources on Boomerang and everything else.
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:35.520]   But yeah, but the, the, it's a really like, what happens is, is people start doing things
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:38.920]   with their cameras and then they start getting slightly bigger jobs and they can't figure
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:39.920]   out how to get all this gear.
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:40.920]   Right.
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:42.520]   So we would, we would smuggle it in and out.
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.920]   We put it into regular, you know, like you do all this weird stuff and then you, and
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:48.520]   then someone said, why don't you get a carne and you're like, what's a carne?
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:51.360]   And they're like, oh, it's the way that you get gear in and out of countries.
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:54.120]   And you're like, so I'm trying to get past that.
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:56.600]   Get everyone past that today on Fridays.
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:59.720]   So that's what Boomerang is.
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:05.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, Andy and I, where are you going to be next on WGBH?
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:08.560]   I'm on on Thursday at 1230 in the afternoon.

[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:03.560]   Six colors used to be secret podcasts, but then we realized we should probably tell people that we do it so that they will pay for it.
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:08.560]   Anyway, it is one of many benefits you get by being a member, but we do it every week.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:10.560]   I think very good podcasts.
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:11.560]   We try to keep it loose.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.560]   We're just checking in on what happened during the week.
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:21.560]   Sometimes I'm doing laundry in the background or my cat is mowing or my dog is barking and those all go in the podcast too.
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:27.560]   People should check that out if they would like to.
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:29.560]   That six colors membership should be $6.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:30.560]   That makes sense.
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:31.560]   You're kind of stuck, aren't you?
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:35.560]   Honestly, I was going to raise the price and I realized I just can't.
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.560]   I added a couple of higher levels.
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:40.560]   Actually, the higher tiers, the podcast, you can listen live.
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:48.560]   There's a longer version of it that we do an extra segment, but it's very hard to say goodbye to the $6 or $60 a year given the branding.
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:49.560]   You're really in there.
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:55.560]   You should have made it 100 colors and you could be making some money at this.
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:03.560]   By the way, Michael Sargent had a great time at the incomparable cookout or whatever you call it.
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:12.560]   Yeah, we had a meetup of all the hosts because we're all scattered all over the world and like 24 of us got together in Portland, Oregon a couple of weekends ago.
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:16.560]   Yes, we recorded some podcasts because, you know, podcasters, they do that.
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:18.560]   I think that's so cool.
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:21.560]   Yeah, we should do that probably.
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:22.560]   We have a good time.
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:23.560]   Yeah.
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:24.560]   Anyway, thank you, Jason.
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:25.560]   Thank you, Andy.

[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:07.560]   Oh, that's why he's here for security now.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:08.560]   Now I understand.
