[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Renee Richie's back from his self-imposed 200,000 word exile up all night.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Hi Renee.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hi Leo.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Hi I'm Mark.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm back.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   He's not only yet, but I'm back.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   He's got all the stuff.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   All the stuff around here.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Oh, we're going to talk about it in just a second.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Also with us Andy Inako from WGBH in Boston, Boston Public Radio.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Hello Andrew.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Hello Leo.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   You went to the event too.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Indeed I did.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   It was nice to see Renee in the flesh as bandwidth was excellent in person.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Andy Hugs, it was so great.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And from Washington DC, the nation's capital.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Hi.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   It's in uproar right now.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Alex Lindsey, pixacour.com.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   People are everywhere talking about the things.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Is it exciting?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Is it exciting?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's, you know, we're on the floor that we sit on is the floor where all the Eurovision,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   so basically all the European networks are all sitting on the same floor.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And so it's chaos here.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   People running around everywhere because how all the European networks are covering the
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   our elections is all happening.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   That's literally 10 feet from my door.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's neat.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So it's crazy.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   That's neat.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Are you going to have to replace that backdrop with like a photo of like Congress like on fire?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   You know, every week I think I'm going to replace that lap, that backdrop and then I just don't get around.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Well you said the White House, I like it now that you have the capital.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So that's good.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It's nice.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Well the White House one is actually a live feed because Eurovision gets it for the cable
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   networks.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   We just we just route it in, but I just don't like depending on them.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So I just a little bit of inside baseball here.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And the other thing I wanted to know is how many Mac minis did you buy, Alex?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I haven't buttoned yet.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Oh, so when Apple releases hardware, especially computer hardware, I have a tendency to go,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   well, let's see how like point one rev goes.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You know, I so I'm waiting on the on the Mac minis because I'm probably going to, you know,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   unlike a phone or an iPad, I am probably going to obviously put a lot into the Mac minis.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And so they'll be expensive ones.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And so I'd rather Apple get through its turn.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So it's like a car.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You don't want one built on a Monday.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's been my experience with Apple products is that a new build with a lot of new components.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Sometimes they're not, you know, it's because we push them pretty hard to it.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And a lot of average, you know, if you're just using them to run little things, it's probably fine.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But if we're if you're pushing a lot of video or a lot of other things through them, little quirks that they haven't quite worked out show up for us faster.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So so I'd rather give it a give it a couple a month or two.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   How good how good did it make you feel though in the presentation where they showed they didn't use the Mac made to show and look little school children learning kind of program and swift.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   No, they showed racks and racks and racks of them being used by the hundreds.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   That's how we use them.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I mean, you know, I think that they finally realized that's all everyone was putting them in those racks.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Everyone was, you know, and I have to admit, I was like, thank goodness they didn't change the form factor too much because I've got a lot of those sonnet racks.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You know, like if they if they had changed that, that would have been almost as painful as anything else.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And so it's so it's so it's it is nice that that all of those bits and pieces will fit back together except now with a lot more power.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We're you know, we push our Mac mini is pretty hard and and so it's great to have all that overhead coming in.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So I'm excited about buying them. I'm just not ready to buy them.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Just let me give you the Marco Arment.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It was a little call out to Seinfeld.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   The 2018 Mac mini is real and it's spectacular.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So so Terry Hatcher of computers.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yeah, so we will we will get to because I know that you Renee have everything, right?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You got it on the new iPad. You've got the new Mac mini. You've got the new Mac book air.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So we'll get to your your actual hands on thoughts.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   But I'd like to talk to you and Andy about we talked to Andy right after the event, but now that it's the dust is settled and you're back.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I'd like to get some thoughts from you guys about how the event was last week.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   You know, just some background, some colors, some detail.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I thought it was really it was a really nice venue. It was a really good place to have one of these events.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It kind of underscores how interesting it is to we all thought that now every single event is going to be at the Spaceship Campus.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But no, sometimes Apple really has a message to send that isn't sent by having a generic spot.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   They really chose this really beautiful Boar style 100 year old opera house for it.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   There was a lot of crowding.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   We've talked about the technical stuff. So as far as as far as the event went, I got a little turner.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It wasn't a demo room that was agent to the space.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So we had to kind of go back and around a corner and I didn't know whether I supposed to go back here or whether I was supposed to go over here.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And as a result, I was I got to like be in the crowd that's like waiting in the stalls outside of the demo area as I looked up and saw my good personal friends, Jason Stell and Ray.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   On the balcony, like where they had the demo area for the iPad Pros thing.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Hi, friends.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   We ran. We ran so fast, Andy.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   We sat at the back and we ran.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Well, now you've had time to sit with them and actually use them.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Apple seeded a really long. I mean, when you see Marco with a review unit, some YouTubers got MacBook Airs.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I mean, they seeded a lot of people with early units and review units this time around.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It feels like Renee. You had you have everything.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And by the way, with the top of the line, did they say I noticed most of the iPad reviews were the 12.9 inch with a terabyte storage.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Yeah, I got the top of the line iPad, but I got the bottom of the line Mac Mini, which is the same as I got for the iMac Pro.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I think Apple actually likes giving me the entry level model to see what I can do with it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Because it's like the third or fourth time in a row. They've done that.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And it's always fun to see because one of the main questions is, do I really need to pay for anything extra?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So I think it's fun to take that.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   I agree.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Yeah. I mean, what do I get for 11.99? Is it worth buying a MacBook Air for 11.99 or should I load it?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I find it really, like I really like, and I find it so interesting what Apple is doing now because previously it was you had an event.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So I think the first thing I did was I had a bunch of people in the early days, it was magazine and newspaper people.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Then eventually they let the bloggers in and the magazine and newspaper people were really upset for a little while.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And then they started letting YouTubers in, but it was like, you went to the event, you went to the briefings, you posted your review, and that was it.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And now they're sort of doing all these different things where sometimes you have like a big Steven Levy story in advance,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   or you have a big YouTube video come out in advance, or you have YouTube hands on.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And as much as it pains me to say this, like when I write about it, or Jason writes about it, or even MKVHD does a video about it, they're talking to Tech YouTube and Tech Blog.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And one of the things I liked is that they, and I think they started this with the watch, they had a bunch of people from like who do Broadway plays and who do business and who do also like fashion and people who just use vlogging and photography.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And some of the earliest MacBook Air videos were from people who weren't Tech YouTubers, they were photography YouTubers, and self-servingly I think Apple knows that that's now, if they want to grow their audience, they have to actually give it to people who are beyond their normal review audiences.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I have to say, and it's purely personal, it's a parenthetic note, but I feel like Apple loves those guys and hates us.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   We were dinged, got a copyright ding on our YouTube feed of the Apple event, they pulled us down, we're still down on YouTube Live, we got a nasty gram from YouTube, a attorney named Michael Fortis trademark attorney at Kilpatrick Townes in San Francisco.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And we're off YouTube Live thanks to Apple, and Michael Fortis, they're apparently their guy.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So I feel like it's like, at the same time, they can embrace the YouTubers, but boy, if they're pushing us away, why is that?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Is that because we aren't tame, pisses the hell out of me.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   No, that happened to it, it's been happening for the last two months and a bunch of really high profile YouTubers too, and there's been videos about it in articles, and I feel like Apple just hired this company to go out and enforce copyright, and they have no idea what they're doing because
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   there were a bunch of iPhone reviews that were demonetized last year, and this year there were videos about people who had their views taken down, which are totally legitimate, and they had to complain and file against it and eventually they were brought back.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So it just feels like lawyers who are doing loyally things and have no, and Apple is just not supervising them at all.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Yeah, and also, only Apple knows why they invite certain people or why they don't invite certain people. It's hard to speculate and really useless to speculate on that sort of thing.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I really think that's just, I got their actions to prove it.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Well, that's a different thing. That's where they can suddenly decide that we're asked, we were not willing to pursue the idea of, is it?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   We were asked before they weren't willing to pursue legally the question of when you add your own commentary above our live video stream.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Does is it journalism slash is it modified content? Is it protected speech, or is it someone abusing our IP, or is it something that we can get away with?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Apparently, as as Renee has as Renee said, they've got a new group that is willing to at least see how far they can push people around before that becomes too expensive for them.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   But I just wanted to amplify something that Renee said earlier that it's, people aren't invited to this thing as a sign that they have made it or that they are accepted by Apple or that they're laptops of Apple.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   People aren't not invited because they're out of favor or because they've said the wrong things.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I think the biggest the biggest feature here is that they have a thousand invitations, a thousand cease to fill.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And they're trying to get a specific message to as many people as possible.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   So if you've got like 50 Renee Riches on the list, maybe 15 of those Renee Riches are going to have their seats given to someone who is not Renee Riches, so to speak, because, well, we got, we already have 20 or 30 Renee Riches.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   We need someone who is like in the fashion industry, we need someone who's a photo blogger, we need even a makeup blogger because we're also, this is also the inexpensive line of MacBook Air.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   So we're trying to get people who are just students, like getting their next machine.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   So people, it's been a long, long time since these things have been strictly press conferences.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   I have been around long enough that the big Mackerel keynote was once a folding chair set up in a back room at a Boston, at a Boston convention hall, and a folder that you could probably just pick up the folder full of press releases and leave, rather than actually sit and listen to the whole presentation.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Right, it is this is promotion, this is marketing.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Oh, it's clear.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   I mean, when you first started watching the rest of us that maternalism.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   When we first started watching the stream and they were these cheers, it was clear that the audience was packed with Apple employees, at least I.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Oh, those were Apple retail.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   They were so excited, Leo, because they had for any of the rumors.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   I know when Angela started talking about the stores, that's when the cheers got the latest.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   But it was funny too, because they had not heard the rumors.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So when they said like USB-C on the iPad, they're like, "Oh my God!"
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   That's interesting.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   You got to find Apple employees who don't know anything and load the auditorium.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   But they're also the ones on the front lines who hear all the people complaining about these every day.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And when they get something that they think is going to solve a complaint of their repeated customers, they were like, "Joyous!"
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   I know, but grudge them their cheers, absolutely not.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   But it's very much like President Trump loading the FBI with staffers so they can applaud him or the CIA with staffers so they can applaud him.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   It is intended to cast the impression that the people are going wild for what we have.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   It's completely an advertising event at this point.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   I guess that's not a surprise, but it's just disappointing that on the one hand they're doing that,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   and the other hand they're shutting down commentary on their stuff.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   That is really, in my opinion, anti-media and it's shameful.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   But that's their right to do it.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   We never dispute it.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   It's particularly dangerous on YouTube.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It's impossible for any company to shut down commentary and shut down journalism.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   If I don't get invited to an event, I will still watch the live stream.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   If I don't get loaner hardware, I will buy it.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Guess what? I don't get invited to an event.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   I get my YouTube shutdown and I buy all the hardware because we need to cover it because we care about our audience.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Apple clearly doesn't care about our audience.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   But the reason why it's so dangerous when they shut down people on YouTube is that they don't make money when their things get demonetized.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I can still sell anywhere I want. I can still put it on my own site.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   They don't have the ability to shut down an audience of millions of people.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   That's why I think that Apple should really tread a lot more lightly when it comes down to demonetizing YouTube videos because that is...
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Andy, you don't understand.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   They didn't demonetize our video.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   They prevent us from streaming this and everything we do on YouTube Live.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Period.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   We killed our YouTube Live feed.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   I have no interest in monetizing it.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   There were no ads on that stream that was pure commentary.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   This is...
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Anyway, enough because it's about me.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I'm just saying that is disrespect for the audience.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   That is not disrespect.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   I don't take it personally.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   That's disrespect for the audience.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   It impairs our ability not only to cover Apple products but all products on YouTube Live.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   They shut our YouTube Live feed down entirely.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Period.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Not about monetization.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   We monetize otherwise.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I don't care about YouTube money.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   This is why it becomes dangerous to have lawyers making decisions.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   No, that's not.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Apple made that decision.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Not some guy named Tony Ford is...
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Again, well, what I was about to say is that corporations have our face with lots of "problems"
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   where technically someone is violating copyrights, technically someone is violating a trademark, but it's not in their best interest to pursue it.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And the fact that it's been done for the past 10, 20 years without any problems happening...
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Means that you say you should probably continue to let things go.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   It's when they start to flip the switch and start to be aggressive that it does become a big problem.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Whether it's just demonetizing videos, whether it's shutting down live streams, I think Apple, as usual, is...
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   As usual, they tend to be conservative and then roll it back as they get pushback.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   So hopefully...
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Hopefully things get rolled.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   We're still going to do the coverage.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I'm not going to let it bias my coverage, but I think it's a terrible way to handle media.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   It's very much the modern way to handle media.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   So let's talk about the products, because that's really all that matters.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   One of the things...
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   We've talked about this last week during the event and during the Macbreak weekly, but Renee wasn't here.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I don't think you were here either, Alex.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   One of the things I saw immediately...
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I'm gratified they start with the Mac, but then I realized why they started with the Mac,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   because as soon as they started talking about the iPad, it was like, "Oh, you don't want the Mac."
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   You want the shiny new...
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   It's pretty clear that Apple's heart and most of their technology is now going to iOS devices, yes?
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Absolutely.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   That's where all my money is.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   The money is all there.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Do you agree, Renee?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   You know...
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   So I don't like talking about Apple as though it's a monolith, because it's decidedly not.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And I'm going to just pimp my own content shamelessly for a minute.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   I got to sit down with Tom Boker.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Sorry, Tom Boker.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Oh, that vector was great, yes.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Oh, thank you.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   He's senior director of Mac product marketing, and he's been at Apple for 30 years, and he ran the iMac product marketing with Steve.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   So his heart and soul is all Mac.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And I think they understand a lot of the frustration with the Mac, but he believes it's really his job and hardware engineering's job.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And you look at people like Laura and all the people who are on stage there.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And they are not...
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   They don't spend part of their time on iOS and part of time on the Mac or all the time on iOS.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   They are a dedicated Mac team, and they are fighting for resources.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And when you look at what they've managed to release this year compared to previous years,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   I think an argument would be made that they're winning.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   They're not all the way there yet, but they're winning more battles than they used to.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And they don't talk about Intel very much anymore, but you can talk about T2 and custom Mac Silicon and sort of the things that they can do there.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   It sounds like they're building towards something, and they are jumping at the bit to sort of talk about the future of the Mac even though they can't.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   So both the keynote and getting to talk to him afterwards was like, I have not seen him like this.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   It's almost like he's like, "John Turnus, you can go do the iPad if you want to, but I am doing the Mac this year."
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And he was on fire.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   People who know him said he's never been on fire like that.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   So I think yes, absolutely, the iOS generates all the money, but I think we're getting closer to a Mac Renaissance,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   where they'll do some changes, some shifts, and it'll be a really interesting product line.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   So I guess we should do as Apple did and start with the Macs and save the best for last.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Oh my God, that's depressing.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   But we are gratified that they released a new Mac mini.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   You have it there. Show us. It's pretty. It's slate.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Yeah, it's Space Grey, so it has to be pro.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And look at these. Do you remember these?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Yeah, you were saying before the show, I haven't plugged in an ethernet jacket so long.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   I know that is awesome.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   So it's got a full-size ethernet.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And by the way, it could go up to 10 gigabit, which is kind of interesting.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Yeah, that's an upsell, but you can get it.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Yeah, it's got four type C. Those are all four Thunderbolt three.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Yeah, Thunderbolt three and it's got two controllers.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   So they're all full speed 400 megabits per and you've got USB C,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   which is USB 3.1 second generation, which means that goes up to 10 now.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   10 gig, 10 what?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Gigabits per second.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   You're kidding. I didn't realize that.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Yeah, so it's one quarter Thunderbolt three speed out of just USB C now.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Full-size HDMI 2.0.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   2.0, yep. Nice.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   And two, count them two type A. Is that are they USB 3.1?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   I believe so, yeah.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Okay.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Not that who cares.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And a headphone jack because something's got to have one.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   There's no retinites played to push it off the Mac mini.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   That is a sweet box.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Is it the same dimensions as the old one?
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Exactly two millimeter, the same case things.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   But all new thermal handling system.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Which is a new fan and new power supply.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Yeah, I see this.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Having the form factor and the power button in the same place is important for anybody that's got a solid button.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I don't know if it didn't think of that, but you're right.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Well, because of the way the sonnet works is there's a little button in the front and then it pushes this little spring in the back that hits the, hits the power.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And so if they had moved that power button, it would be all of our racks.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   All of our racks would be worthless.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   You're talking about this rack Mac mini rack mount enclosure.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Which all of us have lots of.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   I don't know if anyone else makes one, but I mean, anybody just got a bunch of Mac mini's.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I mean, we've got probably 20 or 30 Mac mini's and got racks for all of them.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   So this is what replaced X serve for you.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Yeah, it's like a one.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   It did.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   It did.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And I'm hoping that, you know, when I look at this, I'm hoping that that Apple keep on going down that path and, you know, that our, you know, my dream, you know, Mac Pro is three you.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   It's just three.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   You want high and just, you know, and maybe you can take the ears off and it looks nice and you can set it on your thing if you want.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   But, you know, I think that, you know, all that circular stuff has to go and we just just have something that, you know, that pros are using.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   There was some speculation.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   This might be point the way towards a Mac Pro.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I think this is, you know, this is going to let the Mac Pro be a little more different than it might otherwise be because you don't need the Mac Pro. You can get like Alex 30 of these and just do.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   But it would be nice to be able to have, you know, multiple, well, it would be nice to have Nvidia boards, but I don't know if that's ever going to happen.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   So, so, but being able to swap boards out easily, there's still a lot of things that I think Apple could innovate past what the current PC market has, which is swapping boards out easily.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   That was one knock on this, which is that the Intel motherboard graphics aren't very good, but you could use the EGPU with this.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   They had the EGPU set up to demonstrate.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And you can keep swapping them out if you need to.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   I mean, that's kind of crazy, but I guess.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Well, every single workstation where they had these things set up wasn't you.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   You have the server set up where it's like stacked in five.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   You had the media set up where it has EGPU.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   I was I was hoping that they had at least one where I could just turn it around and flop it over, but everything was hooked up into such a bionic man sort of set up that they really were showing that this is the this is the do everything Mac for a million different situations.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   This is it really does show to maybe to every names point that when you have a boring Mac, it gives you license to do whatever the hell you want in the rest of the line.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   So long as you give us that one boring Mac that has a million ports and it's just a simple, easy to deal with size and there's plenty of airflow through it so that you don't have to worry about stacking them or stuff like that.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Then you get to say, guess what? We're in a cross promotion with Doritos. We're making a Mac Pro that shaped like a curly corn chip triangle with rounded corners.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Then you could say, okay, well, if I didn't want if the Dorito shape Mac isn't isn't to our liking, especially the dongle for for ethernet.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Hey, we can just get the Mac mini. It has all the ports we want.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   I'm having a few in his review. Marco pointed out that the Mac mini builds overcast as fast as his 10 core iMac Pro.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Yeah, it's no joke.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I think some of that is the SSD. It looks like now all of these T2 Macs and I'm sure all future Macs will have the T2 chip in it.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   It acts as a disk controller for bare NAND flash, right?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   So all of them are benefiting from this way of doing.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   And it's so fast that you have to reconsider RAM because they got memory compression and they've got SSD that are so fast.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   You can sometimes barely tell when it's swapping.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   So it doesn't matter, DDA.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   When you say reconsider RAM, you're saying like the amount that you need.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   The amount of people will still be upset that they can't get like they get up to 64 on this, but they'll be someone going,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   why can't it get 128? You got to realize that 64 gigabytes on this is not going to be like 64 gigabytes was five years ago because it is so fast and it swaps so fast.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And there's just so much you can do with the technology now that I don't say go for eight.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I don't tell anyone to go for eight ever, but at 16, I think a lot of people who previously thought they needed 32 would get by swimmingly.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Interesting.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And I probably I would probably get 32 just to have a little headroom, but I think that 64 is absurd on a Mac Mini.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Which I'm glad they give us the absurd option.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Same with two terabytes of SSD.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of a lot of hard drive space in my computer.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   So I think that it just it creates bad habits, which is keeping everything.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I prefer to keep all the large files on a separate computer so that if you have to fix your computer, you can just take it in and nothing important there.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And you don't have to figure out how to extract it.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   So I keep my apps and I let my mail sit on the on the main computer, but I don't, you know, on the main drive.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   So usually I buy 256 partially, you know, it saves money, but the main thing is it keeps me from developing bad habits.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Well, and with all the connectivity in the back, this is a great machine for doing that with.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Well, and when you think about rendering, I mean, you know, this is, you know, when you think about like compressor or which has recently been a little funky, but hopefully it will get better.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   But when you, but when you think about like that, that type of thing, especially with 10 gig connections and running compressor, running cinema 4D across a whole bunch of renders, all of those things are going to be.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   These are great little boxes that you can just throw in there and sometimes just throwing a lot of, you know, a lot of processors at it that aren't expensive.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   You're not paying for the screen. You're not paying for a bunch of extra hardware.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   You're not paying for redundant power supplies, all the things you'd see in a server.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   You know, most when we think about these big social networks and huge render farms, a lot of times they're buying the cheapest computer they can.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And when it dies, they just pull it out and replace it with another cheap computer rather than thinking about expensive computers.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And in the same way, the Mac Mini just gives you the ability to throw a lot of things, you know, throw a lot at it.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And it's not that expensive. I looked at the configuration that I would do and about $2,000, 1800 bucks.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   It's not, you know, it's still expensive. It's not as cheap as they were, but we're going to be able to do a lot more with them.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Yeah. And there are a lot of people who are in a situation where the best sort of upgrade they can do is literally take it out of the box, unplug everything out of their old one, plug everything into the new one, and then continue exactly where you left off.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And so the Mac Mini is such a great machine for that sort of thing. I'm definitely considering buying a new Mac Mini because they really delivered this time.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And you know, I know you just lost your SSD on your laptop. This isn't a laptop, obviously.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   But it should be maybe the first choice on a desktop instead of an iMac?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   I would say so. The great thing about getting an iMac is that you're getting, if you're in like photo, if you're in production, you get a really beautiful display made it to that really beautiful CPU.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   So there's that. But if you already have a very decent monitor, the amount of money you can put into getting more RAM, getting a better CPU, getting all the accessories that you plug into something that make something a lot more useful and a lot more valuable, I would much do that much better.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   But much rather do that than put that money into essentially an extra display that you don't really need or an extra chassis that you don't really need.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   You always think you don't think about processing power per duty cycle. You think about processing power per dollar that you're putting into this thing.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Often times you find that if all I do is, if I were to spend a set of $2,000 on an iMac, if I spend $1,000 on a Mac mini, plus $800 for a better share because I have a bad back and I have a hard time working for more than two or three hours, you'll be a lot more productive with this setup with this $1,800 that you spent than you would with a $2,000 iMac.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So think about dollars per unit of work you get done. Well, furthermore, you can then choose the display you want.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Yeah. I mean, if you want to go with this 38-inch ultra-wide LG monitor, you can.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And also the new Apple display coming next year, you might want to wait for.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Wait a minute, tell us about that. Did Apple announce that?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   They announced at the same time as a new Mac Pro, the new Mac Pro is going to come with an optional pro display. There's all sorts of rumors, everything up to it being like 300, 300k, not a 5k, 900k or 8k, whatever those kids are watching now.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   See, I love my iMac Pro, but I look at a super wide display, one of these curved displays, and I'm thinking, boy, maybe I would be happier with a display.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   What I have is a three display, and the bezels getting away and stuff. It'd be nice to have just one super wide.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   So maybe, yeah, maybe this is a good choice.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   It's a good choice.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   My whole workflow change, my whole workflow changed the first time I put a screen on an arm and I could put it exactly where I wanted to go, and not only that, but lift it out of the way when I don't really want it in the way.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   That was such an easy expense of $180 that made so big a difference in how much work I get done.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   So that's what I'm talking about.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Or two of them.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   And then you could...
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   So you're out of your cell.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Amazon makes two monitor little arms that just attach to your...
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   We buy them like chicklets. They're like 50 bucks.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   And so, because when we're loading into locations, that's how we mount all of them.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   We know when you don't use any stands. You just throw them all onto these arms.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   What do you attach to the arm?
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   You have to attach those stands.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   It just screws onto the table.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   So you leave after you do a production and all the tables have holes in them now?
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   No, no. It just clamps on.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Oh, clamps on rubber.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Yeah, it's got a little clamp. You just clamp it on.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Every time Alex comes to town, there's holes in the caterers' dap.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   The caterers' dap is like, "I heard a lot of drilling. I can smell wood, but I had no idea what they were doing."
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Oh, they have clamps.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   So that's an interesting thing.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   See, now I'm thinking...
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   That's a big business in...
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   I mean, if you go to Amazon, there's a lot of people that make them, but the two-arm version from Amazon is the one we do,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   because the price performance is really good.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Like when we do big render, big streams and we need a kind of a control panel, we have like six of them.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   They all go off of one pole in the center.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   And then there's six 4K...
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Something like this, you mean?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   That's the...
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Yeah, there's a lot of different versions.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   That's the one. I think that...
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Nice.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   You can be three and there's one of them that does six.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Six one is the one that we like a lot.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   I like it with the clamps. So you just clamp it on to something.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   You just clamp it on. And they work great.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   The main thing is you get really...
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   That's a Visa mount, right? So you need a monitor with a Visa mount.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Every monitor you buy, you always check, does it have a Visa mount?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   You know, it comes to the end.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Once you start doing them a lot, you start to get specific about the kind of Visa mount and the way that those little heads work so that like when you have six of them, you got to make sure that the head will rotate and you can make it small.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   So you can do this.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Line it all to monitor.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   (Laughter)
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   There's a lot of options.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Showing from as you listening, this is an arm that's clamped onto the table and one is in portrait and one is in landscape mode. And so you could just go crazy here.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   It's the...
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   You know what's funny? I have a very nice desktop setup. I rarely sit down at the desk because I end up using the laptop, you know, moving around.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   See, that's a discipline problem for me. If I don't have scheduled desk time, things on my weekly to-do list don't get done.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   And that's a sign of old age. When I was in my 20s, I could... Just like you could sleep anywhere at any time.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Now it's like I can get lots of work done on a laptop in bed, on my sofa or whatever.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   If I don't get to sit off with proper posture on the loud clacky keyboard, something in the brain gets switched on to saying, "We are in work mode. We are not going to get distracted."
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   So a lot of things go factor in productivity beyond what kind of RAM you got.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   So the Mac mini looks like for a lot of people an interesting choice.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   I think a lot of people are going to be excited about it.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   I wish they'd held the line on the lowest price buy-in.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   So I'm a little bit disappointed that the cheapest Mac has gone up a couple hundred bucks.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   So $7.99. And it's got i3.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Especially with an i3.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I don't know if that... Is that a big... It's got a faster clock?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   No. I mean, I was looking at... It was a bunch of people testing them and it seems like... And I think I have to find out what mine is.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   I didn't even look at that yet. It seems like it's way more capable than you might otherwise think i3 is at this point.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Okay. Yeah, Intel has really muddied the waters with their processors.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   We don't know what the hell's going on. We're going to get to the Y series.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   The mystery. And we're going to ask why.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And they renamed Corem into i so that they don't think you can tell the difference.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   But we can tell the difference.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Oh boy, two CPUs and no GPU.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Okay. Is there... I mean, I guess if single chip performance were what mattered and it does in many programs,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   you would get the 3.6 GHz quad core i3.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   But if multi-core processing makes a difference and you get the 3.0 GHz 6 core for 300 bucks more or no.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Yeah. I'm going to wait and see what the Alex applies.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Yeah. So a little tidbit and I know... Can I share this tidbit that Renee you shared because you're getting a briefing at this event about these Intel chips.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Can I say what you said?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Yeah. Well, those weren't the Intel chips.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   That was all about the... The... Yeah, no, the arm chips.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Oh, in the iPad. Okay. We'll save that. We'll save it. We'll save it. It's going to be very good.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   But the T2 to me is very important.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   It's obvious Apple is going to put that from now on.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   If they're putting the mini and they put it in the air, they're going to put in every Mac.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   To me, that's going to be in the long run.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   The key that keeps people from making hackintoshes.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   That's the... It makes the whole platform much more secure and for 99% of the users out there, that's a huge win.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   I'm just concerned about what happens when you've got a Mac mini that is otherwise end of life that you would like.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   In the past, we've been able to simply say, "Actually, you know what? Maybe I'll just set this up as a Plex server.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Or maybe I'll just set this. I'll put Debian Linux on this and then put it in a closet and we'll run my print server or stuff like that."
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   So you can still get lots of value out of it.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Remember, the undeniable advantages of Macs is that Apple makes great stuff.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   You can... You want to crawl underneath a Mac when there's a tornado coming because these things are built, man.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   So it would be disappointing if they use it as a way to control the platform to do a systems check and say, "Ooh, I haven't seen the part number of this SSD you put in here."
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   For your own safety and security, until you take this to an Apple dealer and swap that out for an Apple branded SSD,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I don't want to let you hurt yourself by compromising the integrity of this entire system.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   So we'll see. That's just long distance thinking. Again, for 99% of people out there, I think it's a really, really big thing.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   There is a big question, Mark, and I'm quoting forronics here.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Apple's T2 documentation says that the T2 is used for signed UEFI operating systems.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   This same thing came up when Microsoft put UEFI on its Windows machines.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   The Linux community was up in arms, "Oh, we won't be able to put Linux on them."
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   It turns out if you turn off Secure Boot on a Windows machine, you could still put Linux on there.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Apple's support responded to this article saying it may be possible to disable the Secure Boot security in full when booting to the startup security utility
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   in the macOS recovery mode, which may allow Linux to then load on the device, albeit without any security.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   So my understanding is that people are still saying, "Even if you do that, you can't get it on there."
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   So my understanding is that if you're like an IFixit type Jedi, you can change your own RAM.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   The RAM is SODM, so you're fine there. The storage is long.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   I'm only back with SODM going forward. All of them are soldered on now, right?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I think the other IMX, you can crack them and you can't have to double check.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   I believe you can't, again, if you're Kyle Lyons, you can change the Mac.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   I think other people can take it in. I don't think it's soldered, though.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   I think on some of the IMX, at least, you can take it into an Apple Store, Apple Store.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   But the SSD is connected to the T-tube chip now, and they're doing that for security reasons, because they want to verify the entire boot chain,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   and they want to verify the security and doing real-time encryption.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   My understanding is if that gets broken, including you turning off system integrity protection willingly,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   if you go in and say, "I don't want this stuff," you can do that, but then you lose the ability to authenticate for Touch ID on that machine,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and you'll have to use an iPhone or an iPad because they do continuity authentication.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   That's fair. That's fair. I think if you put in the Linux on there,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   I have many Linux laptops that were Windows laptops where the secure fingerprint doesn't work.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I can live with that. But if you couldn't put Linux on there at all,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   it wouldn't be the end of the world, but it'd be red flag.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Putting Linux on Macs has always been a little trickier than Windows machines.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   And it goes the other way, too. At some point, I'm sure Apple will say,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   "The next OS 10, 10.20 is not going to work unless you have a T-tube chip on there."
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   I think that's the other direction they're going to go with.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Or it'll be ARM, and it's just going to be written for ARM.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Well, there are ARM machines out there now.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   I think that Apple is looking at in the future,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   and I think that a lot of us are...
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Right now, they have to fight a battle to keep their business model open
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   with Australia wanting to tie things in, and Britain wanting to tie things in.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   The United States wanted to do it, just using those two countries as proxies.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   The issue is that security is going to become a really big deal.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And Apple has picked the right horse, and our USB connections, for instance,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   are completely insecure.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   I'm sure you've talked about that on security now.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   You can actually defeat them at the hardware level in a way that you can't...
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   So things like the T-tube are very important to integrity of the hardware
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   because the hardware no longer has true integrity.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   If someone wants to compromise your hardware, they can do it now.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   And that technology, of course, was developed by our own intelligence agencies.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   And then...
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   So that becomes really important because you need to be able to trust,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   at least be enabled to type on your keyboard.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   And as we move to Touch ID, we move away from passwords.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   As we move to...
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   These are all things that people who are concerned about security,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   good people and bad people, are going to continue to move towards the Mac
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   because no one else is solving it as effectively,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   because no one else has the whole system.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   That's what's already happened on the iPhone, frankly.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Yep.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   And they need to have both the software and the hardware to do it.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   And at a future date, I think that the ability to sell hundreds,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   if not thousands, of device X to a contractor Y is going to rely on being able to conform
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   to security standards that are still being developed.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   So this is...
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Like I said, Apple did back the right horse here.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   And it has the added benefit of eliminating hack and touches
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   and keeping people put in Linux in their beautiful computers.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   It does, but I think that those are such...
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   For side effects.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   For side effects.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   It's collateral damage that they don't even care about.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   I mean, they're not even thinking about it.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   It's such a small percentage of users is probably less than a hundredth of a percent.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   And so they don't really care about that.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   What they care about is the fact that that's a good...
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It basically forces everyone to play a game that only Apple can play well.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And so by moving towards making security and really taking the lead in that area.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Well, we spent half an hour on the mini.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   I didn't think you deserved it though.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   We've been using this for a long show.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   I didn't expect that.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   I'm going to have my dinner delivered.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   But I will agree.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   It probably does deserve it.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   It's actually pretty exciting.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Marco said that.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   He said, "I would say this makes the Mac mini great again, except it never was great.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   It is now."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   I got to say, though, more than any feature, more than any feature,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   more than any port or any strategy.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.640]   This gives me something I didn't have last year, which is some sort of solid evidence
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.000]   that Apple does care about the Mac.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   They don't care about it as much as they care about iOS and iOS devices.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   I'm still certain.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   But Buress, a piece that I wrote last year was basically about, "I'm not 100% certain
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   that Apple will still have a Mac in three years.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   I'm not absolutely certain that they haven't already circled the date on a calendar in a conference
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   about the date when they're going to announce that they're going to stop making Macs."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Now, I feel as though it does have a future that they are going to be backing it up and
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   that you won't necessarily have to buy a Pro anything in order to get that support.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   For me, that was the best news from the entire event.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Let's take a break when we come back, MacBook Air.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   I think there's new iPads, something like that.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Are there something like that?
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Coming up.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.160]   All of this stuff, for those of us not on the Apple list, comes tomorrow if you ordered
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.160]   immediately.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:14.000]   In fact, I have a very, I don't envy my FedEx driver tomorrow.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   We've got a lot of boxes coming.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   I told you that story, right?
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   The FedEx icon goes, "What are all these boxes?"
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   And I said, "Apple watch bands."
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   And he goes, "Bands, I have 100 of these in my truck."
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   That's funny.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   That's funny.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   They're all these long boxes.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   What are these things?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   What could they be?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   They weren't all me.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   That was a surprise.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   There's other people buying them.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   There's other people buying them.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.520]   And we will have reviews of the Mac, many MacBook Air and both sizes of iPad in the days
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.760]   of weeks to come on a twit.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.840]   But Renee's got his reviews and we're going to get to the MacBook Air next.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.080]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.320]   I am, I might have to take out a mortgage to buy all this Apple.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.880]   I'm pretty sure the credit card went over $10,000 on Tuesday.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880]   Unfortunately.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.480]   And now I hear that the Pixel Slate is available for it.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   Oh man.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.200]   Oh man.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.800]   If you need a mortgage to buy a new home, I don't think they yet will offer you a mortgage
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.400]   to buy a new Mac.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:21.360]   You want to go to Quick and Loans, the number one lender in the country and for good reason.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.640]   When I say number one, I mean number one in a couple of very important ways.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.920]   Number one in customer satisfaction, eight years running.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.080]   Number one in customer satisfaction, eight years running according to JD Power.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.600]   And number one in volume.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.160]   That started in December and I think they're closely related.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.520]   Do you make customers happy?
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:47.160]   They're going to, they're going to become long time, long term repeat customers.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.720]   Rocket Mortgage is another reason Quick and Loans is so great.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.400]   They said to the geeks, hey, you guys don't want to go to the bank.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.520]   You don't want to fill out a long form.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:59.560]   And most of all, you don't want to get all the old bank statements and pay stubs and
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   facts into us.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.840]   You don't want to do that.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.640]   How about an entirely online mortgage approval process?
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.560]   Something you could do on your computer or even on your phone in an open house.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.720]   That's when Rocket Mortgage was born.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.880]   Rocket Mortgage is an entirely online mortgage process.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.120]   Actually Quick and Loans calls it the power buying process.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   It's three steps.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.720]   I'll walk you through it real quick.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.640]   Go right now to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak and create an account.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.040]   That's an easy thing to do so that you'll be ready.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.160]   Now when you see a house you want or maybe you're going to start home hunting and earnest,
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.760]   you can go right into the power buying process with step one.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.320]   You're just going to answer a few simple questions.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.800]   No 20 page application.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.680]   No need to visit the attic.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:43.120]   Just like home address, name, birth date, social, that kind of thing.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   They'll check your credit.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.920]   They'll offer, they'll tell you which loans you qualify for based on your credit.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.440]   You choose the term, the down payment, the rate.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.080]   You now have pre-qualified approval.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.360]   That was all around about five to ten minutes.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.240]   I mean quick.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:03.160]   Step two, Quick and Loans over the next 24 hours will verify income assets and credit.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.800]   If everything checks out they give you verified approval.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.080]   Now you're basically a cash buyer.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.320]   You move right to the front of the line when it comes to making offer on a house.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.160]   There's no contingencies.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.160]   Then step three.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.760]   This is something that we only recently have needed.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.760]   Interest rates have been pretty flat for a few years.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.880]   They're starting to tick up.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.880]   That means there's some anxiety in buying a home.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.680]   What if the interest rate goes up before we buy it?
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.240]   But is it going to cost us more with the rate shield approval?
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.520]   Step three, it's all new.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.360]   It's exclusive to Rocket Mortgage.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.160]   With rate shield approval your rate is locked.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.720]   It can't go up for up to 90 days.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.960]   You got three months to shop.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.960]   If rates go down, your rates go down.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   That's nice.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.520]   But if they go up yours does not, it's locked in.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.000]   That's exactly what you'd expect from America's best mortgage lender.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Rocket Mortgage.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Back in loans and Rocket Mortgage.

[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Back in loans for their supports.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   MacBook Air.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.360]   Now I've seen a lot of people, at least before they got the MacBook Air, before they got
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.880]   the Tom Bogan briefing, that you got Renee.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.000]   A lot of people looking at the MacBook Air saying, "A, Apple could have done this years
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   ago."
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.280]   Oh, there it is.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.440]   The Apple could have done this years ago.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.000]   B, it's just not enough of a change.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   See, what is this Y processor that Intel has put in here?
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Is it reasonable to say that the MacBook Air is a disappointment?
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.200]   They could have absolutely done it years ago.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:56.600]   I think the prevailing wisdom was that the MacBook would drop in price and take the MacBook
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.360]   Air slot the way the MacBook Air had dropped in price.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:03.280]   We have to remember the original MacBook Air came out at $17.99 and didn't do much after
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   that.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:10.200]   The second edition came out in 2011 at $12.99, but by 2014 dropped $999.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.840]   I think people thought the MacBook, which came out at $12.99, would drop down to that $999
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.240]   point and there would be something new.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.720]   It would become the new MacBook Air and there would be a MacBook in between.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.120]   That would make so much sense.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.120]   MacBook.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.920]   If you wanted ultimate portability, MacBook Air, and if you wanted ultimate power, MacBook
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.560]   Pro, but it just didn't work.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.320]   The MacBook 12-inch, my understanding is it's still expensive to make.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.480]   It's got expensive parts in it.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.160]   I guess Apple was just...
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.120]   There's a lot to the story and I think we'll hear about it probably next year.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.200]   But Apple was looking to do something more with that machine and just things did not
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.920]   work out, not with Intel, not with Apple, not with everything.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.280]   So rather than just keep waiting, they made a conscious decision at the same time they
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.200]   started talking about the new Mac Pro to update everything else on the line, including the
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.600]   Mac Mini and the MacBook Air.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.080]   This is the update that they could do now given the chips they're using and all the other
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.800]   technology they have.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:08.160]   It's sort of like to use the Steve Jobs analogy, a MacBook, the 12-inch MacBook hooked up with
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:12.920]   the current with the previous MacBook Air and had this little baby that's still wedge-shaped
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.840]   but has less bezels.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.840]   It's not a liquid retina.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.820]   It does another rounded corners but has the super fast SSD, has the Touch ID, no touch
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.640]   bar, but it is sort of that new generation MacBook Air.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.640]   It doesn't have...
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.640]   Again, it doesn't have a touch bar.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:32.880]   And the controversial part, as far as I was thinking and I was upset about this when I
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.920]   first heard about it, is that it doesn't use the U-series Intel chips, which the previous
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.120]   one did, which the MacBook Pro does.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:43.800]   It uses the Y-series, which is what the MacBook was using, which used to be called Core M,
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.200]   but now Intel thinks it's funny just to call it I-series.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.640]   So this is a Core M processor.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.640]   It used to be.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:54.840]   It's now called Y, but it's the M is what they use in the MacBook and it really is a
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.840]   pig.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   Yes.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:04.120]   So the MacBook currently has KB Lake Core M and then basically Core M3, M5, M7, but
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:09.840]   they still use M for the 3, but they use I for the 5 and the 7, and it's a mess.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.000]   This uses Amber Lake, which is not Coffee Lake.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.520]   Coffee Lake is a U-series, but it was explained to me...
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:21.040]   First, I got yelled at by a bunch of the other smarter tech bloggers there who actually write
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.080]   about Silicon all day, and they're like, "You can't just look at a name on a chip.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:30.120]   You have to look at the base frequencies, the turbo frequencies, and the thermals, and
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.160]   then find out what kind of job it can do."
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.840]   Because if it does a really good job, that doesn't matter if it's Y series, or if it
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.120]   does a really bad job, it doesn't matter if it's U series.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.520]   And according to them, and then what I managed to ask about and verify later is that it's
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.720]   got pretty good base frequencies, it's got pretty good turbo frequencies, and it's got
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.720]   a really good...
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.080]   Like it's 5 watts, so it doesn't put out a lot of heat, which means that it doesn't
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.280]   get throttled the way a U-series would in this casing.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.800]   Apple could have made a bigger casing, but then you get, literally get the bottom level
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.960]   Mac Pro, and you can go with that.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.960]   Apple, though I think, has clocked it up because the TDP on this, I thought, was 7 watts.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:12.280]   Yes, it's a custom variant of Core Y that didn't exist until Apple asked for it, and
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.840]   until Hardly put it up on the page after Apple announced it.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.400]   Is 7 watts faster than 5 watts?
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.920]   So you don't have to get Ian Cutriss or somebody from Ryan Smith from Anantec on, because it
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.040]   really is so complicated now.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.800]   Like I said, literally every time I go to sleep and I wake up, there's a new lake processor
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   from Antell.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.680]   It's very confusing, and Intel feels like intentionally muddying the waters.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.840]   I don't think they even want us to understand.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.280]   No, but I've been running benchmarks, I've been running stuff.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.720]   I used to use a MacBook Air all the time.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:47.200]   For everything up to trying to render file cut fast, it works well.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.560]   Like I can do everything I want to do.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.560]   See, that's the thing.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.800]   I have a lot of affection for that form factor.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:58.360]   I almost went back to a MacBook Air, even with that horrid screen and those giant bezels,
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.560]   that was what stopped me just because I liked that form factor.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.920]   Who could forget in 2008 Steve Jobs pulling a MacBook Air out of a Manila envelope?
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:07.920]   It's beautiful.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.720]   It created a whole product category, the UltraBook.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.920]   The UltraBook, yeah, it was UltraBook Zero.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.760]   Everybody copied them.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.800]   Somebody get me the Huawei MateBook.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.200]   We have a MateBook X here.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:27.000]   Everybody said this is what the next MacBook Air should be.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   It's not.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.960]   No, it's not the redesign.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:35.320]   The redesign for the MacBooks and the redesign for the iMac is still coming.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.760]   That'll probably look more like the Liquid Retina display is with the Face ID.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.480]   This is still a next generation MacBook.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:46.120]   Is this just for people like me who love the MacBook Air, who are nostalgic and we just
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.400]   want a little bit of a refresh.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.160]   I love it that it has a C2, it has a fingerprint reader.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.000]   I actually love it that doesn't have a touch bar.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.680]   This is what some people were saying, oh, this is the Huawei MateBook X Pro.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.480]   They said, oh, this is what the Mac.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.480]   Look at the bezel.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.400]   Well, you can't even see it because it's not on, but it has a fingerprint reader.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.680]   It kind of looks like a MacBook Pro.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.920]   Touch screen.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.760]   There are bezels are infinitely small.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.400]   There was one negative because of the small bezels.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:17.080]   Actually, you're not even seeing this looks like the bezels are bigger, but this the bezel,
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.600]   this is just an image that doesn't go all the way to the edge.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.920]   The one negative on this is there's nowhere to put the camera because of the small bezel.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.440]   So they put it in the keyboard and it looks like it's a noss.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   It looks right up your nose.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:31.280]   Yeah, but on the upside, you can turn it off by closing the press.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.360]   Can they just do a notch?
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.640]   I mean, haven't we just conceded the war to the notches at this point?
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   No, not you.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   Periscope.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.640]   Periscope.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.480]   I want to look in periscope.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.920]   Oh, a mechanical chooser.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.320]   It just chooshes the camera up, takes your photo, choos it back.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.360]   So if I could get, I'll be honest, if I could get Mac OS on this, this would be awesome.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.000]   It's got a real processor.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.800]   It's got a U processor.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   My guess that is coming with the Face ID Macs.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   The Face ID.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.000]   Oh, so you think they'll be a Face ID Mac?
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.680]   Yeah, they're just getting Touch ID pushed out and they just got Face ID into the iPad.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.320]   Okay, that was what some people were saying was, why is it their Face ID on this thing?
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.960]   Yeah, I mean, iPad gets it next.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   That's just a reality.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.160]   It went to my phone, iPad gets it next and then Mac gets it.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.600]   Same as Touch ID.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:17.440]   So you said, yes, when I asked you the question, this is for people who love the MacBook Air
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.040]   and just want a little bit of a more, more.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.040]   It's for most people.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.560]   Like I would say if you're all confused, if you just want to get a MacBook, the MacBook
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.560]   Air is the main one.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.720]   100 bucks more, I could get the MacBook.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.440]   No Touch bar MacBook.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.280]   Yeah, but that has way more.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.960]   You're giving up more to get it.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.320]   I was shocked by how much smaller it still is.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.440]   It is so tiny, even compared to the MacBook Air, but the performance isn't as good.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.880]   It's still running KB Lake.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:49.080]   It does come in the new gold color, but it's not quite as nice as a general purpose computer.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:53.800]   It really is for an executive or a startup person jet setting and it wants a faster than
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   the MacBook.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   Yes.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   Okay.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   Yes, considerably.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   That's what Lisa wants.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:03.680]   She likes her MacBook a lot, but she's really become disappointed by its performance.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.400]   So we'll be a little faster than that.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.480]   Wouldn't it be wonderful if they decided to make the MacBook nothing, the entry level
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:13.840]   MacBook where they found a way to sell it for $8.99?
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.080]   Because the size itself is compelling every millimeter.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.480]   It's sort of like an asymptotic relationship.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.520]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.040]   Back to math class.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:36.240]   It's like when you have when you have something like the MacBook Pro, and you make this big
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:41.760]   MacBook still big, but a little bit smaller, those extra couple of millimeters, they don't
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:42.760]   matter.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:43.760]   They may as well not bothered.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.480]   When you take a machine that is already really, really small, and you take a small amount
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.520]   off of it, it almost becomes a different thing.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.400]   And we forget I don't have a MacBook nothing.
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.040]   So it's not until like I go handle one again there.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.400]   Remember that this is essentially the size of an iPad.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.000]   It's essentially as thick as an iPad.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.920]   They could really get away with, yes, this is not the most powerful machine we've made
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.080]   by any stretch whatsoever.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:13.240]   We are in a neck and neck race with Raspberry Pi for being able to render pages as quickly.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:19.800]   I think it's all here's $900 here is a $900 machine that runs the latest version of MacOS
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:24.560]   and will compete with all of the really good five, six, seven, eight, $900 Windows machines
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.200]   out there that are convertible.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.920]   That would be wonderful because we have the same problem with the MacBook Air that we
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.600]   had with the Mac Mini as far as I've concerned where it's wonderful.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.480]   I'm very, very pleased with it, but it's still the minimum buy in has gone up by a couple
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:38.480]   hundred bucks.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   I'm not really thrilled with that.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.120]   I think the MacBook Air will try isn't go ahead, Alex.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:51.000]   Actually, a question for Renee or Randy is with the specs isn't the new iPad faster
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.240]   than the Oh, we have a guy in the iPad.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.600]   That's my point is they went through all this.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.920]   It's missing, but forget all that.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:03.120]   Wait till you see the buy a 12 by on a 12 X by on it.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:04.120]   Wait till you see.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.800]   Yeah, the eight 12 is actually faster than some Mac book pros.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:13.080]   If you're a fan of the geek, eventually, oh, the new Mac, the current Mac book is a 30 93
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:21.560]   single 48 70 multi the new MacBook Air is 42 39 single 78 46 multi.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.560]   That's fast.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:28.400]   And the top end MacBook Pro is still 52 99 single and 21 501 multi to the nine nine.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.200]   The thing that was yeah, and that's what I actually am using.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:36.880]   I'm going I'll be going from an I nine MacBook Pro to perhaps to a Mac book here, but I think
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.880]   I like the portability.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.400]   I like the form factor.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.320]   The Mac book won't drop.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.760]   My guess is Mac book won't drop just because it remains expensive for Apple to make it.
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:49.000]   So they're going to position it as you're willing to pay extra for miniscularity.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.680]   But the Mac book air, the Mac book air always starts high again, 1799 and then 1299.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.680]   This one's 1199.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:59.440]   So it's the cheapest the first edition first the first release model has ever been, but
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.080]   then it drops to 999 and I'm hoping that's an important that's important.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:08.040]   It's the cheapest that the MacBook Air release edition has ever been.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.040]   Yes.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.880]   So that means it can get down in a year or two to nine.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.840]   I think that like if you're a pessimist, you're going to say that Apple knows people
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.360]   are hungry for it and will charge them every cent they can the minute it comes out and
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.680]   then lower the price to get to more people.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.280]   If you're if you're an optimist, you'll say that it's expensive to put it out.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.600]   So Apple wants to recoup the production costs as fast as possible.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.880]   And then as it scales, they'll adjust the price to a more mainstream point.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.960]   You lose some stuff, you lose the SD card reader, you lose some connectors.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:39.960]   You've got basically all you've got is two types three type C Thunderbolt three connectors.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:43.520]   Yeah, and three point five millimeter and a headphone jack, which we're going to have
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:49.120]   to start now mentioning every time because otherwise just assume it's gone.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.320]   Apple Park is built on a graveyard of three point five millimeter.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:56.440]   And the irony is that I think that Apple's actually doing pretty well in the corporate
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.440]   environment.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:01.600]   They're always the home computer, but they are doing pretty well.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.000]   Yeah, they're doing really well in the corporate area.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.560]   And I mean, you see a lot of corporate companies.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:12.040]   I mean, even if you walk around some of these big campuses, you don't see a lot of PCs.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   I mean, you see, like I'm talking fortune five, fortune 10, you see Microsoft's got
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.440]   a bunch of PCs and even they have a lot of Macs.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:30.080]   But these big companies are buying when pretty much what happens is 90% of their employees
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.280]   when given the choice of what they're going to buy are buying Macs.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.400]   You know, saying like, you know, you're going to get issued a computer, you can have a PC
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.560]   or Mac, they all just get Macs.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.680]   You know, like, you know, they're not, they're not.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:45.480]   And so I mean, if they're forced to get PCs, they get PCs, but not very many on these
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:49.400]   big companies are buying, you know, are getting PCs if they don't, if they don't have to.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:55.480]   So, so that that also changes Apple's projected ASPs because, you know, there's a little bit
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.640]   more room to work there.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:02.520]   And Apple's been pursuing the even more aggressively in the last years that we're focusing on making
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:07.160]   as much money off of every customer as we possibly can, as opposed to market share,
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.000]   which is very, very sensible.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.200]   But we always have to put this to the filter of this is why Windows has 82% of the market
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.760]   and why Mac has much less than a 2% of the market.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:23.160]   For me, it really is the idea of I don't, I really don't care how successful a market
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:27.120]   in market share or profitability company is as long as they get to still make the stay
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:29.480]   in business and control their own destiny.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:36.320]   I just worry that we'll wind up with a platform of again, I keep, I keep saying it and I hope
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:40.760]   it doesn't come off as as glib or insulting, but I don't want Apple's motto to be go be
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:42.080]   poor someplace else.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:48.520]   I think that is important to have a low minimum buy in or at least competitive minimum buy
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:53.160]   in so that the people who are not having their computers paid for by companies who are just,
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.520]   they're starting their first year of college.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:59.440]   They have to buy their first really good laptop that isn't a hand me down.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.720]   I hope that they can get the system that they want that runs the operating system that they
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:08.080]   want and they don't have to get Windows machines strictly because it's the only one they can
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.320]   get that will meet all the guidelines that they need to meet for their freshman year of
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:15.560]   college and them which is going to be practical for what they need to do.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.480]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:24.520]   I think that probably my guess is that Apple has a designer that is pretty particular that
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:30.720]   doesn't want to compromise very often on what's there.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.760]   Anytime you build a piece of hardware, we've built some hardware that we've only used for
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.440]   ourselves, you realize how many compromises you make because this is too expensive or
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.680]   that's too hard or those other things.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:47.080]   I think that Apple would rather produce what they would consider works of art than trying
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.000]   to fit into that box.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.840]   Like I keep saying the highest level of success for any company is the ability to do what
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.760]   they want without being beholden to outside forces including marketing forces.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.640]   On that basis, Apple is probably the most successful company that's out there, certainly
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.680]   the most successful company in technology.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.280]   That's why you see a point of view with every machine that they make.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.600]   All right, enough max stuff.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.680]   That's a test.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.600]   Let's talk iPad, baby.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600]   I'll hold them hand-to-hand.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.520]   I'll switch from my wired headphones to Bluetooth for instruction.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:27.640]   But only if Renee had an iPad to show us or Andy.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.040]   They've got to have an iPad line or let's see.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040]   No, no.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.280]   Where's the folio case?
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.960]   He's got the folio case.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.360]   These keys, by the way, are bubble wrap for me.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.480]   This is my worst change because I can't stop pressing on my bubble wrap.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.040]   I'm like, all right.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.800]   Here, let me turn this bad boy around.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.800]   Here we go.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.800]   This is a 12.9.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.920]   See, this is what I was really interested in.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.880]   I had the old 12.9.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.440]   It was just too big.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.520]   But now what they've done is the same size screen with a smaller form factor.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.520]   I feel like that might be the one to get.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.920]   People thought it was the 11 inch and they're like, what does the 12.9 look like?
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.720]   They were like, that is the 12.9.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.320]   Wait, wait, wait till you hold it.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   I was surprised.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.400]   Like after the after the demo area, I went to look at the specs.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.840]   I was surprised to find out that the new 12.9 inch is not that much lighter than the old
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   one.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.720]   It felt so much lighter in my hands because it's just feels so much smaller because it
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.880]   is so much smaller.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.800]   So it's it's it's quite a nice piece of kit.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.200]   He pulled that trick that I forget was a Googler Microsoft who said that you could balance
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.760]   it on your finger because they arrayed everything around it.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.800]   So I was doing that at the thing and it made them very nervous.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   You can do that.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.280]   You can just say, yeah, I can take me a second to get my finger.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.560]   It'll be actually handy for sushi.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.720]   You could put the right kind of surface there that glass.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.360]   I'm going to totally drop my iPad now.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.360]   Please don't please don't.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.360]   There.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.920]   So you can just totally we look at that.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.120]   See, these actually that's a good.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.160]   So he's got his finger on the apple.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.920]   And it is it is.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.520]   See, that's the kind of real attention to detail.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.520]   I love Apple.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.320]   Well, it makes it feel lighter because it weighed the balance is distributed nicely.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.120]   That makes a huge difference.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.600]   Just like a magazine or a pad of paper also balances around the center.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.560]   So that's such an important little detail.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.560]   Wow.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.880]   Yeah, you don't want it to be heavy in one end.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:16.280]   And it's kind of the thing you might not notice, but you will subconsciously.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.240]   I do have to say the lack of a headphone jack baffles me.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.240]   I just.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.240]   Yeah, I asked about that.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.240]   You didn't see it coming, did we?
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   We it was a surprise.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   I mean, they got headphones.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:30.320]   They were happily showing the schematics where like there you would have plenty of room,
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.720]   but you'd have to make it because you the liquid retina goes past what you would see
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.720]   where the bezels are.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.200]   Like he goes inside there to house it.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.040]   So there's no room in those bezels.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.600]   You'd have to make it thick enough to put it underneath the display.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   And they didn't want to do that.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.760]   They didn't want to add like a Han Solo box like they would.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.760]   Many of them falcon.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.960]   They have a camera bump for crying out loud.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.720]   Yeah, but it's not thick enough.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.200]   Like the sorry, go ahead.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.760]   No, that's that's what I'm going to say.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.760]   I mean, it's okay.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.640]   It's okay for them to say we have lots of decisions to make.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.400]   We decided that we didn't want to put a headphone jack in there.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.800]   The only thing that I would do that really, really gets my hackles up is if they were
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.560]   to say, well, we had no choice.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.560]   Our hands were tied.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.520]   Well, no, you could have done it if you wanted to.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.920]   You just didn't want to.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.640]   And I do think that on an iPad Pro, that's a dumb move.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.200]   I do think that's dumb.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:24.480]   Well, fortunately it has a type C port and I can use my Pixel 3 headphones.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.680]   And the battery is long enough.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.680]   So what do you think?
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:32.160]   It could do anything type C can do except external storage.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.440]   It can do external storage.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.880]   It's just that iOS and the files app has no concept to external storage.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.000]   So you have to get an app that understands internal storage and then you can plug it
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   in and you're fine.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.160]   It doesn't have a driver.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.200]   If you plug it in as is, it'll think it's a camera.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.000]   And you got to think that that's a glaring hole that Apple is going to fill with iOS 13.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.840]   They could easily get over the next the next six months or the next six to eight months.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840]   It's going to be explosive.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.400]   Watching what happens with that USB C.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.720]   Well, don't be like a reality app that'll let you plug in a drive within three seconds.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.840]   Could I plug in a keyboard and mouse now?
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.920]   No, it has no keyboard.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.920]   I don't know.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.160]   The Bluetooth is still for that, but it has no concept of iOS itself.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   Doesn't know.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.080]   Beyond the insertion pointer on the trackpad mode, it doesn't understand it.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.660]   They would have to add something like Focus UI, which is what lets you choose on an Apple
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:18.880]   TV, which icon you're on.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.080]   They would have to actually have to build out a system because iOS was designed for the
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.080]   iPhone.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:28.880]   Like the iPad is hobbled by a lot of early decisions for the iPhone when they didn't
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.600]   really foresee what it was going to be now.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.520]   And that's another one of those things that they're going to have to go through.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.320]   You can't just drag and drop Mac on because that's terrible.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.960]   They have to actually architect it for iPad.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:44.080]   But that really shouldn't affect how it works with USB keyboard, right?
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.040]   Because you can plug in a USB keyboard into the living port with the route.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.040]   Okay.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.280]   Just want to make sure.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:58.400]   So I think Neelai Patel's Verge article for me was pretty right on in which he says, "Look,
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.400]   you can't deny it.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.960]   This is amazing hardware.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:07.200]   As Apple pointed out, the curves, screen, corners, in every respect, the Superfast 12x
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.680]   Bionic.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.600]   But without it, it's hard to edit text unless you have a mouse.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.880]   You can't do it with your finger very well and no trackpad, no mouse.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:25.400]   And the software today for iOS isn't really desktop quality.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   The lack of file system.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.080]   You can fix that, I guess.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.640]   It's a lot of promise.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.400]   I'm going to try anyway to use it as my main system, but I have a feeling I'll have the
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.000]   same reaction Neelai does.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.560]   I just think that it's just like with the day one of the first version of the iPad, I
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:50.440]   don't think you can judge it as a laptop or as a laptop replacement.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:55.440]   You have to think about it as the things that you do with your laptop and can you do
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.240]   those same things with this device?
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:02.000]   And sometimes in a lot of cases, the answer is going to be no, particularly if it involves,
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   I've got arbitrary file X on arbitrary file storage device Y. I just need to get this
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.480]   damn thing visible to this file system.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.160]   That's going to be a complete fail.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:21.080]   However, when you look at the caliber of mobile, productivity apps have been designed for the
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.080]   iPad.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.600]   And yes, we're talking about art apps.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.080]   Yes, we're talking about drawing apps.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.920]   But we're also talking about things like Scrivener by literature and latte.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:35.440]   It's a really hardcore book length writing tool that is one of the most brilliant translations
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.920]   of a desktop app to mobile, to a tablet we've ever seen.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:45.480]   I really don't think that Windows has got there quite yet in terms of taking a, taking
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:50.440]   an app that works great on a big screen and making it work as well in that context of
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.440]   a smaller screen.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.080]   I've been using a Chromebook for the past couple of weeks, particularly since my Macbook
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.440]   died.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.520]   And it does many things very, very well, but not at the same level of polish.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.560]   And then beyond that, you do get the ability to use this pencil in a way that's not, Oh,
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.560]   isn't it great?
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.080]   And notes when you're handwriting notes and you're doing little sketches and doodles,
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:15.960]   no, with the iPad Pro, you really can do professional caliber artwork with it and people do.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.160]   So I don't, I agree with the broad strokes of that argument.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:24.560]   If you're buying this, if you've got a thousand bucks or 1300 bucks for a new laptop and you
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.640]   buy an iPad Pro instead, you are going to be let down.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:35.360]   However, if you have 13, 12 or $1,300 for a mobile answer to, I need to do XYZ double
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.280]   X double Y double Z and you find the solutions for the iPad, I don't think you'll be terribly
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.000]   disappointed at all.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.240]   I have to point out that when you have Renee with a terabyte of storage, yeah, is over $2,000
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.240]   when you include the fully.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.240]   So in video editing.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.320]   And yet I, this is where it's frustrating.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.480]   It is so sexy.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.960]   It's such a desirable object.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:06.120]   And there's no question Apple absolutely knocked it out of the park for that.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.120]   It's a little frustrating.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   It can't be my computer, you know?
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.840]   Well, like, so from, I think it really, like I was reading the, the, like the response,
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.320]   nearly did a phenomenal review.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.240]   If you haven't watched it yet, please go watch it.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.840]   He also managed to do it like in half the time it took me to review it.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.760]   So the man is incredibly talented.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   There was a lot of pushback on it from both sides.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.480]   Like some people say that, you know, until it actually becomes a Mac, it is never going
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.480]   to be useful for them.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.320]   It has to have, they want finder.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.960]   They want, like the, they want terminal.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.120]   They want everything.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.640]   And other people are like, you're an idiot.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.600]   I don't want it to be a laptop.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.560]   Laptop's always terrible for me.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.240]   I'm, I do XYZ and it's always, I do like, I do this work case and it's different than
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240]   yours.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.680]   So everyone is very personal about this.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.320]   Like if it doesn't do exactly the way they want and the way that they want it, you know,
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.760]   they either think that you're wrong for rejecting it or that you're stupid for accepting it.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.480]   And I liked what Steve Troughton Smith had to say where he's like, there is just basic,
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.600]   like regardless of what your work case is, regardless of you think the current, like
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.920]   Rob McCollum was at the event and he does, he did Pacific Rim.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.000]   He did, he does Star Trek Discovery, phenomenally talented.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.080]   Does it all in an iPad and thinks it's silly that people complain.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.960]   It's not a full on creative pro device.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.360]   But there are other people who say, I work in a studio with a bunch of other artists and
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.160]   I need it to connect to storage and I need it to connect to this.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.760]   And you, you cannot do that.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.680]   And therefore it is not a pro device.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.800]   And both of those are incredibly legitimate points of view.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.200]   It really depends on your work case.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.840]   But to go back to Steve, there's just basic things like you need, you need file, you need
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.960]   system level support for external storage.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:35.000]   It doesn't matter if it's a finder or if it's something better than a finder.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.800]   It just needs to handle a bunch of reasonable professional workloads and it currently doesn't
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.800]   do that.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.880]   And I, and I, I almost always have both an iPad and a, and a computer and I use them very
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.640]   much with each other all the time.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.360]   And I think that the continuity stuff has really made it a lot easier.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.200]   But, you know, a typical workflow for me, if I'm building a presentation is I, I don't
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   want to think about what kind of type I'm using or, and I build, I build a lot of presentations
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.280]   on Kino and a couple, you know, a couple of weeks.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:11.920]   And, and so I, so I sit and I think about what I want to do and I, and I, and I'm on
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.080]   my iPad and I just sketch.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:17.360]   I take my pencil out and I sketch and I just one slide after another because now I'm in
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.760]   my, my train of thought, you know, I'm, I'm just, this is what I want on this slide
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.440]   and then I'm going to go to this slide and I'm not, I'm not constrained by figuring
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440]   out how to do it.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.520]   I don't go off into any rat holes.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.160]   Now I bring that over.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.840]   It's in the cloud, you know, it goes up into the cloud and then, and then I open it on
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.280]   my, on my computer and I replace all that chicken scratch with actual, you know, pieces.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.960]   And then when I, then I go back and I look at it on my iPad and I draw over top of it.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.520]   I really want to change this and I want to change that.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.680]   And, and so there's, there's this back and forth.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.680]   Now, I would probably do it all on my Mac if I had a touchscreen, which is part of why
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.120]   I feel like Apple hasn't given us a touchscreen is because I, you know, so I, you know, because
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.320]   I, if you have the touchscreen on the Mac, you'd be like, Oh, I don't know if I need
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.320]   my iPad.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.280]   And so, but, but I am, I do find this thing.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.280]   I can't type very well on an iPad.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.680]   Like that's the, I mean, that has been the thing that I don't feel like I can type a
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.680]   lot of stuff.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.800]   And I think that's probably what keeps me more than almost anything else away from using
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.080]   it, like just going out and going away from more.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.840]   I mean, I'll go away for a couple hours with my,
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.600]   they asked Adobe, what do you do for fonts and Adobe had to say, well, you have your
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.640]   online Adobe font account.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.280]   It's, it's, I mean, I've been, so I've been, I got the Chromebook pixel on loan for like
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.240]   long term loan a couple of weeks ago.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:38.120]   And the one of the biggest insights that I've had is that I love my iPad pro.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.120]   Okay.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.160]   I bought it the day, the first day it was available.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.720]   The first time I was available for ordering, I bought it.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.280]   I didn't even wait for my loaner to come in.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.280]   And I've been loving it and using it just almost every single day since then, what I'd
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.800]   fail to, I stopped appreciating after using this for so long is that there, so much of
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.360]   what I do is writing on a keyboard.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.440]   And when you get to just simply start writing by opening a laptop and there's your keyboard
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.440]   and it's wired in.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.600]   So you don't have to wait for it to connect.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.520]   And you can get an actual really good attached mechanical keyboard and you can actually use
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.240]   it in your lap as I did during the event last week.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:19.920]   That's a pretty big feature that I'd sort of been overlooking.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.360]   But the thing I really want to leave people with is that this is, if I've always, my general
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.240]   piece of advice has always been on buying new hardware is that if you buy a new piece
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.360]   of hardware, it should either solve a problem or create an opportunity for you.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:40.280]   So it's possible that you might look into how many new opportunities having an iPad will
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.400]   create for you as opposed to having a new notebook.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.400]   I've started screwing around with oil painting because I don't want to spend, I can't spend
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.760]   50 or 60 or 70 dollars on paints and brushes and stuff like that.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.120]   But I've been watching YouTube videos about people doing really good oil paint portraits
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.120]   and I'm like, oh, wow.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.360]   So if you just break things down into planes, that's kind of an interesting way of doing
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.360]   things.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:05.000]   And well, I'll get this fake set of oil paints for my iPad and start painting that way.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.200]   And it's fun and it's interesting.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.800]   And I feel like it's creating new opportunities for me.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.640]   So that's, I don't think that is a one to one replacement.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.440]   Think of it as its own thing.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.520]   It's like when Steve slit it in between the iPhone and the Mac book.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.720]   My big wish is that instead of iOS 13 for iPad, we actually get iPad OS.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.160]   Watch OS gets its own OS.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.080]   TVOS gets its own OS.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.200]   iPad OS needs its own springboard.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.400]   It needs its own capabilities.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:34.480]   And yes, use backboard and use all the amazing security and under the core OS stuff that makes
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.640]   iOS great.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:41.360]   Let that top layer be unique the way that it is on the watch or the TV.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:48.960]   How do you like the new pencil?
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.120]   It is so good.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.160]   He is not compatible with the old pencil.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.600]   The old pencil is not compatible with the new iPad.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.280]   So you've got to get that rage out of your system early.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.640]   I'm just placed mine.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.520]   So I can't show it to you, but it's great.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.680]   It's got a flat side to it.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.960]   I would love it to be completely hexagonal because that's, that's what a pencil is to
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.960]   me.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.800]   But you know, you can double tap it, which I like better because the having the convenience
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.040]   key on my old Wacom stylus has always bugged me.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.400]   So just tapping it works great.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.400]   It's a little bit smaller.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.200]   I don't like that it says apple pencil on it.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.560]   I would rather that was gone, but it, it, the technology, the core technology is the
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.560]   same.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.480]   The drawing experience is very, very similar, but it's got a matte finish.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.080]   So it feels better when you're holding it and just being able to funk it onto the top
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.440]   of the iPad Pro.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.160]   And it uses those magnets, those are red pole magnets to align itself like the air, it's
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.800]   like addictive, like putting the air pods back into the case.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.800]   It just funk.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:44.040]   I doing it over and over again, funk, funk right into place that I love.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.040]   It's super strong.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.640]   I do knock it off occasionally.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.760]   So I wish there was some protection on the folio cover because I have to make sure I
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.000]   hold the iPad by the top with my palm over the apple pencil or my internal paranoia.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.320]   It just flares up that I'm going to knock it off, but it's remarkably strong and you
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.280]   can like shake the thing and it doesn't come off.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:07.880]   And I love the fact that when you do, I totally agree with you both on the, as much as much
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.080]   as I love, whatever new technologies in there, all they had to do was put a flat edge on
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.360]   the old apple pencil.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.520]   And I would have just said, oh, blah, K-bella.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:23.500]   But yeah, but it, the magnet is just strong enough so that it feels really good when it
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:27.880]   thunks into place and it won't shake off, but it gives you that satisfying little plunk
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.720]   when you, when you pull it off.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:35.280]   The also such a great apple touch when you do plunk it on there, a little notification,
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.120]   not even notification, but it's a little stamp just rolls down from where you attach the pencil
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.480]   saying, hi, this is a head these pencil.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.760]   The battery level is at 73%.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.440]   I'll just go away now and let you know.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.720]   The only bad thing though is that now that there is no physical home button, it's hard
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.880]   to know, it's hard to, not only no physical home button, but no headphone jack.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.680]   Using the orientation of the iPad Pro is a little bit trickier.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:04.080]   So there, again, I've only played for, played with it for about 20, 30 minutes.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:08.160]   So maybe we're able to say more about this, but there are times where I was looking for
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.920]   like the, the power button or whatever.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.880]   And it wasn't where I thought it was going to be.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.400]   Or I wanted to put the pencil back and there is a visual cue on the actual edge, but you
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.000]   can't see it from the black of the screen.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.120]   So there are times where like, wow, why isn't grabbing?
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.600]   Oh wait, this is because I'm not actually putting it on the top of the magnet.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.840]   I mean, people have said that I haven't, I haven't thought about it.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.640]   But for me, like the industrial design team just trolls because the power button on the
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:36.280]   iPhone moved years ago and it's on the side now and it's on the top of the iPad.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.720]   So I keep pressing the volume up to turn it on.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.000]   And every time, it's always like there's always something that's just different enough.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.720]   And I recognize you can't just change everything because then the volume buttons would be where
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.640]   you dock it on the keyboard.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.000]   So there's things I want that I just don't know better solutions for.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.840]   But it is such an amorphous object.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.520]   You turn it and there is no up and down.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.160]   There is no left and right.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.160]   It is genius.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.360]   Like Andy says, if you cover the Face ID camera with your hand, it has a little pointer saying
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.800]   your hand is covering the camera.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.360]   Please move it to Face ID.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.600]   If you turn it upside down, it says please look down because the camera is at the bottom
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.320]   now to do Face ID.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.400]   So you have to look down and it tells you these things and that's a really nice touch
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400]   is.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:19.120]   But because you can tap to wake it, I almost never look for the power button anymore.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.840]   Unless I want to turn it off, I guess that's where it is, Andy.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.960]   If I have to turn it off, why would you want to turn it off?
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.960]   It's brilliant.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.920]   Oh, and what happens, I didn't get this answer last week.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:32.240]   When you want to use the iPad Pro to charge your phone or to charge something else, how
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.240]   was that determined?
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.920]   When you plug in, does it ask you, do you want to charge this device, sync this device?
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.520]   Do you ever try that yet?
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.160]   I did, but I plugged in the magic mouse just to be a jerk and it didn't ask me anything.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.160]   You just started charging it.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.160]   Because I felt like that shot of the phone.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.640]   It's a little indication that said really, really.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.280]   I felt on it.
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.720]   I feel like if they don't want that, they need to fix the mouse.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.360]   I mean, that's just me using what's available to me.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.680]   You should, you should file a radar.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:03.640]   I filed a radar saying expected behavior rose gold because egg gold and rose gold because
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.080]   they don't, they got rid of those.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.800]   And I'm hoping, I'm hoping Jaws sees it.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.720]   It's just my little, little joke, little joke.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:10.720]   Hey, let's take a break.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.520]   We got lots more to talk about, including the A12X bionic.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.520]   Bionic.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.000]   How fast is the new iPad?
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:26.360]   The first word about, is it faster than olive oil soaked pig?
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:33.760]   A word about our favorite olive oil, the new Trace Pontes Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:34.760]   I am a fan.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.040]   Trace Pontes, we talked about them before.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.120]   They do coffee, amazing coffee from Brazil.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:43.160]   You can still get that at TracePontes.com/MacBreak.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.680]   But I want to talk a little bit about the olive oil.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.080]   They've actually, what they've done is they've pinpointed a new business model.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080]   They've started with the coffee.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.600]   They said, what if we went to family farms that make great stuff they've never sold
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:58.000]   before in the United States and help them come into the United States, do a subscription
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.080]   so we can sell at an affordable price.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.240]   And they've done it now with extra virgin olive oil.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.600]   This is handpicked in the Casablanca Valley of Chile.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:14.400]   It's actually again from a single family, Jose Miguel Arnaise Olive Orchard in Chile.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:18.040]   It turns out this Casablanca Valley is one of the few valleys in Chile with optimal conditions
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.800]   for producing this incredible olive oil.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:24.400]   And they take extra care to make sure it's the best olive oil you've ever had.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:30.120]   The olives are handpicked and cold pressed immediately to capture the freshest, purest
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.280]   flavor.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:36.880]   It's extracted completely naturally, no chemicals, no heat because they're prioritizing the quality,
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.560]   the flavor and the aroma over yields.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.000]   There's Jose right there.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.640]   Trace Pontes uses the best olives.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:51.200]   They use five varietals and I don't know, it's an incredible flavor.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:57.000]   Green fruit with maximum, I guess medium intensity, a little touch of spice, although
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.200]   the acidity is as low as you can go.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:05.080]   It's less than 0.2% in many cases, much less than 2.2%, which means it's so good.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:10.480]   That's four times less than it has to be to be evil, extra virgin olive oil.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:14.600]   It is so smooth you will dip your bread in it and you'll go, this is phenomenal.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:22.840]   A reason I turned to this is I saw the 60 minutes piece where it said the Italian olive oils
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:29.760]   are now being doctored with canola oil and other oils, not olive oils in them.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:34.720]   That brings the price down, but it takes all the fun and the flavor out of it.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.600]   This is real olive oil made just the way it should be.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:40.680]   And what a great gift.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:42.640]   They have a variety of different bottles.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.120]   You can even get a giant can.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:48.040]   My mom always had a can of olive oil next to the stove.
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:52.120]   Actually what I do now is I take the can and I put it in one of those squeeze bottles
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.560]   and I have that squeeze bottle next to the stove and it really is a convenient, fast
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.960]   way to cook.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.160]   Would be a wonderful gift for loved ones or for a holiday party.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.760]   Grab a bottle of Tris Pontus olive oil for your host.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.760]   Why bring him a bottle of wine?
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.840]   You can bring him something really cool.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.840]   Sign up for an olive oil subscription.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.720]   Let me get, this is so cool.
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.400]   You get 10% off any bottle you select.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.320]   Plus add the offer code Mac break.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.880]   It's now 20% off.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.200]   T-R-E-S-P-O-N-T-A-S means three points.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.840]   Tris Pontus in Portuguese.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.760]   Tris Pontus.com/Macbreak.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.480]   Offer code Mac break 20% off every bottle of olive oil in your subscription.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:38.560]   Now you can buy an individual bottle if you want to try before you buy, but you have
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.680]   to sign up for the subscription to get 20% off.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.560]   You can place your order on Amazon.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:48.360]   You can try a single bottle, but you want to get the big deal, get the 20% off by using
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.840]   offer code Mac break at the website Tris Pontus.com/Macbreak.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:56.920]   But you know, it's not a bad idea to get one bottle and try it.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.920]   It's amazing.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.920]   You can try it.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.920]   And the other thing is, I mean if you like olive oil, this is the best olive oil I've
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:04.920]   used.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:05.920]   I use it for cooking.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.600]   I use it for eating plain.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:08.600]   I use it for my salads everywhere.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:11.600]   You want to use it up too.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.400]   If you're going to use it, I have to admit that I first started, I was talking to somebody
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:17.040]   about this and I was so good that I was like, "I don't know if I should use it for cooking
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.440]   because I just like to dip it stuff in it."
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.440]   I know.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.200]   And someone was talking about it saying, "You know, olive oil, you know, it'll sit in your
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.880]   cupboard for months or years, but it's not good for you."
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.880]   No, no, you want to use it up.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.880]   You know, you can do it.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.440]   Like when you get it, when you get extra virgin, it's not going to stay that way if
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.200]   you don't eat it.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:37.440]   Basically, basically, there's never a problem in my house.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.120]   Because I use olive oil as almost exclusively.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.520]   I make my popcorn in olive oil.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.240]   I use it for everything.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.160]   And this is so good and it's so affordable when you get the subscription that you will.
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.200]   And it's too bad you're not in studio today, Alex, because I was given this bubble wrapped
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:56.440]   bottle of olive oil for anybody who happened to show up in studio today.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.840]   Sorry, it just is.
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:23:59.840]   That's me.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:02.440]   Actually, I have this subscription.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.440]   I don't need it.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.440]   TracePontest.com/MacBreak.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.880]   Don't forget to take a look at the coffee.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.200]   Great coffee, too.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.440]   And I wanted to make sure you all knew about the olive oil.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.440]   TracePontest.com/MacBreak.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.440]   20% off.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:22.640]   Get a subscription so you always have a nice fresh bottle of olive oil.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.000]   So you got a little bit of a briefing on the A12X bionic.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.240]   Didn't you, Renee Richie?
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:31.680]   Yeah, I think everybody, they were very good at breaking down sort of the different areas
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.240]   to address.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.360]   Because I think they knew what we would find when we started using it and that it does
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.280]   sort of not just keep, like, oh, it's almost desktop class.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.960]   We're approaching desktop class.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.960]   And now it's almost like we're smoking desktop class.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.720]   At least until you get into the i9s or something.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.240]   And those are radically bigger, hotter chips.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:56.560]   It just the amount of performance they're about they're able to get out of, especially
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:00.920]   the, I keep saying A1210 because Apple has trained me within UI.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.920]   Thank you for confusing the hell out of us all.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.920]   Don't let them inside your head, Renee.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:09.320]   Yeah, and it was interesting because like basically what they said is that the platform
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.320]   technologies team has one job and that is to make the absolute fastest silicon on the
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.360]   planet given the physics of the device they have to put it into.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.800]   And that is the only job they have to succeed at every, every, every year.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:25.840]   That's to be able to say there is no way that we could possibly have been any faster
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:30.320]   given the thermal limits and, you know, and the process shrink and everything else that
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.400]   happened this year.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.440]   And when you look at the results of getting out of A1210, which is admitted say A12X there,
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.120]   I'm doing it again, when you look at the results of getting it is benchmarking like a Mac,
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.640]   like a current generation MacBook Pro.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.080]   I hate geekbench.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.120]   So take it with a grain of salt.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:52.960]   It doesn't reflect real world usage, but everybody who's touched these says, wow, they're
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.960]   fast.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:57.560]   When you combine it with promotion, which gives you almost zero lag on anything that
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:02.400]   you do, it is literally like you are finger painting with productivity.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.400]   It is bizarre.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:06.200]   Yeah, it is, it is suspiciously fast.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:15.840]   Makes you wonder what's being, what, what engineers from which companies are have condos
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.000]   in Cupertino because they're working that closely with Apple engineers to produce an
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.880]   amazing app for 2019 that really does underscore the concept of, yes, we know, we know you're
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.360]   spending 12, 13, 14, $1,500 for this.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.360]   You will not be sorry for that purchase.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.120]   And you will not, we will forget all about the first week coverage that said, oh, it's
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.440]   still not a laptop.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.520]   And battery life, it's got a little bit of a smaller battery, right?
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:48.560]   But battery life, because of all the stuff Apple's doing is still the same as the old
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.560]   iPad.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.960]   And Apple's got performance controllers and they do all sorts of really smart things to
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:57.720]   ramp up and ramp down consumption and even like the promotion display will significantly
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.120]   ramp down frames per second if the static, if you're showing like a photograph or something
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.800]   that doesn't have dynamic, it doesn't have a lot of movement in it.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.680]   So it is super power conservative.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.840]   I took it with, I'm just testing with Bookamongo and Elleo because I can find nothing that
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.320]   hits the battery as hard as no, because it's the screen is always on, the GPS is always
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:16.640]   on, the data is always on, and the GPU is always on.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.160]   So it like that, I cannot kill a battery faster than by using that.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.600]   So I took it for their Gengar Day, their raid day, which was four hours of nonstop.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.080]   Wait a minute, you're not allowed.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:30.120]   I think that's a terms of, that's a violation of terms.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.800]   So you can't use an iPad to play Pokemon go.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.080]   The app runs like in use it.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:37.440]   I mean, like I just, it's weird because it's like it's a different aspect ratio, but
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.440]   downloading.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.160]   Yeah, no, I mean, like it doesn't work as well, but it does, it does.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.920]   But you could get good battery life.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:50.000]   After four hours, I was down a 35% on my year old 10.5 and I was down a 53% on my
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   phone.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000]   That's a good test though.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.560]   It passes the Pokemon go test.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:57.040]   By the way, we should point out with that type C charger, you can charge your phone.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:00.400]   So you can bring it and use it as an iPad or as just a big battery.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.760]   Which we all want to do at some point.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   Yes.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760]   Right.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.600]   Yeah, there's so how many, I think it was Chris Breen back when, back before he worked
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.520]   for the mothership, the first person to say that this is the most awesome, I, this is
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:17.480]   the most awesome iPod ever, because I can just keep it in my backpack and it will just
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:22.400]   play for dozens of, dozens of hours because of that big battery.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.160]   That's always been one of the great things about USB C. Part of the spec has been that
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:30.040]   you can decide whether your, the battery is going to be charging something or charging
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.800]   something else.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:37.240]   And so yeah, the, the, how many times you've been a little bit chagrin to think that, okay,
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:43.240]   I got 2% on my phone, but I got 98% on, so I got like a lot of extra electrons on here.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.440]   So conceivably, all I got to do is just pour the electrons from one place to another.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:50.040]   I can't do that because God hates me.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.240]   And as we should mention that Dan Frick's has gone to Apple now too.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.080]   So someone needs to post a guard on Jason Snell immediately.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.080]   Holy cow.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:04.640]   So Chris Breen, anand Dan, they're called well, they stole from us.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.920]   They stole Nathan Oliveris Giles, almost everyone from the Mac book from the Mac world
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:12.560]   team that was at that iPhone launch a couple of years ago.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:18.600]   I think there's like Dan Morin and Philip Michaels, I think, and Jason Snell are the only survivors.
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.840]   You know who Apple's never going to offer a job to?
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.840]   This guy.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.800]   These two radio, these two radio, don't like it.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:32.000]   You and Alex, actually there is a rumor floating that terrifies me that Apple is about to buy
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.400]   or invest in iHeart Media, which is the company that my radio shows on.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.800]   And if that happens, I'm dead.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.800]   I'm just dead.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.240]   Maybe that's why they're buying it.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.040]   Maybe we could just really screw Leo.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:46.680]   Let's get let's kill him in every form of media.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.680]   How do we get that?
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.120]   I might have been actual directive.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.840]   Let's get let's just buy iHeart Media just to give it a real deal.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.840]   There's always that story.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.640]   You know, you can't get a reservation in a restaurant.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:59.640]   Some billionaires are well in that case I'm buying it.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.040]   I don't think Apple would do that.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:07.360]   But can I just say that I'm sure Renee bumped into Ren as well, but she was just as busy
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.120]   and just as she do.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:14.720]   It was a drive by hug because she had a run in say hello hug and then like run out again.
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:18.200]   So whenever she was, she's doing an Apple, she's doing the same thing that she was doing.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.120]   I think at every other Apple event.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.640]   Some of these people, I think Nathan went to the Apple news operation because we now
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.720]   are learning that there really a lot of people working in a curation.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:32.280]   They're not writing stories, but they're in the curation of stories there.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.640]   Is that what is serenity doing?
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.640]   Do you know?
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:37.800]   I don't know if she said publicly, but she's she did say she joined their communications
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800]   team.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.680]   She is on Steve Dowling.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.160]   And you got a briefing from somebody.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.840]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:44.840]   Can you say?
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:45.840]   I don't know.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.320]   I don't know if I can say maybe I shouldn't.
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.000]   Those people aren't completely gone.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.480]   You do see them occasionally.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:54.240]   Well, if you think about who they hired and who would be a good guy to brief you on
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:57.200]   processors, yes, you probably have to think about it.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.480]   You could probably put two and two together.
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:04.160]   But not only that, remember that even when they don't communicate with the outside, they
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:08.660]   are a nation unto themselves that needs its own newspaper, needs its own prov to
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:09.660]   it.
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:13.820]   It generates so much content for itself that if you've got a really good writer or really
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:19.120]   good editor who's who maybe is ready to face the fact that journalism is a collapsing
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.620]   market and is turning in rapidly turning into a veil of tears, perhaps you like to have
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.980]   dental coverage for your three children.
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.580]   Maybe it's time to consider working for Apple or Google.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:31.100]   What else can we say about the iPads they're coming?
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:33.240]   I'm I'm actually so excited.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.660]   You like that folio keyboard?
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:37.260]   Is it any different than the old Apple smart keyboard?
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.260]   It feels the same to me to type on it.
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:40.660]   It's still like I like it.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.860]   But again, I am completely keyboard resistant.
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:43.860]   I am like Fortnite.
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:47.980]   You drop me on a keyboard and within 10 minutes, I am fine with it and I'm just typing and
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:50.700]   it's probably a lack of sensitivity or refinement on my part.
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:51.700]   But I just really don't.
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:55.820]   There's very few keyboards I don't like to use, but it's still the single best use of
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:56.820]   taffeta.
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.820]   Sorry, all you prom dresses that I've ever seen.
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:31:59.820]   That's taffeta.
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:00.820]   It's not.
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.300]   It's not other fabrics.
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:07.220]   No, no, because it doesn't look like a like a dorm room, festered cheeto written.
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:11.180]   Sweat acid stained mess after a couple of months.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:13.180]   But I just don't like the keys on the back of my hand.
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:17.820]   I preferred having the soft touch fabric because I am like sort of fidgety and I feel like
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:21.660]   popping them like packing bubbles after all.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:23.580]   You're putting a bad idea in my brain now.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:24.580]   I'm going to be playing with it.
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:26.540]   I have a feeling and I don't think it's quite as good.
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:29.620]   And Andy can tell me because I haven't used them as much, but like there's two positions
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.620]   for it now.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:34.260]   You can put it really standy, upbeat and a bit leaning back, but it's not like infinite
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:38.380]   positions like on a MacBook or a Pixel Slate with the magnets or like a behinge on the
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.380]   surfaces.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:44.820]   Did they did they seed you with any interesting new software at all?
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:45.820]   Just the stuff they demoed.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:51.380]   I mean, Photoshop isn't out yet, which looks phenomenal, but I am really excited.
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:56.460]   Believe it or not, I'm excited about Diablo on people got so mad.
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:57.620]   They were so angry.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:59.120]   Why were they angry?
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.580]   Because it was mobile and not PC and how dare you?
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:02.820]   Oh, but this is.
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:08.220]   So I've always been not happy with things like Fortnite, which are really not designed for
[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:11.660]   touch on iOS.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:16.660]   You want to touch first game Diablo actually is perfectly, I would say, perfectly adapted
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:17.660]   to touch.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:21.900]   Yeah, but they were not happy when it went from PC to console and they are super not
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.340]   happy that it's like console to mobile.
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:25.340]   Oh, shut up.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:27.060]   Play your Fallout 76 and be happy.
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.140]   You don't need this.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:29.420]   This is for us.
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:32.180]   I will buy that immediately when that comes in.
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:37.340]   And boy, what a nice that 11 12.9 and should be very nice.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:38.540]   A nice size.
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:42.100]   Is that roughly the same as the MacBook Air screen is they pretty like next to each other?
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:43.100]   MacBook Air is 13.3.
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:45.580]   So it's slightly smaller.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:48.140]   It's closer probably a little bit closer to the MacBook.
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.140]   Nothing.
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.140]   Okay.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:53.380]   But it feels big because there's literally no edges and just like the edges drop off.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:57.940]   Like it's gone back to the it's gone back to the Deeter Rams, Braun, Leica, influence
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.980]   design, like the iPhone 4 era.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:03.780]   But it's I didn't think I'd like it because I was so hoping that finally Apple, the Macs
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:04.780]   are all unified now.
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:05.940]   The design language is all the same.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:09.660]   And I thought that this would finally happen and we'd have all the iOS products, all the
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:10.660]   same design language.
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:13.220]   And then they did this and now I want an iPhone that looks like this.
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:14.220]   I hate it.
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.060]   And I'm glad and I'm glad they put I think they lift just enough bezel on that display
[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:21.140]   to make it easy to handle.
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:24.020]   My worry was that they're really going to take it as far to the edge as possible, which
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:28.980]   meant that it would be so difficult to just simply take it off my table without doing
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:33.860]   more than waking it by having to basically undo whatever it is that I just just created.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:36.380]   But it seems like they made some rational choices here.
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:40.220]   It's really telling to that Apple, you know, Apple strategies started to really become
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:46.500]   clear when they say things like the it's as fast as the Xbox one S, you know, say.
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.540]   Faster than 92% of laptops.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:51.500]   Fast to the 92% of laptops, including our own.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:56.500]   So last year, those those really tell you what Apple's ambitions are.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:57.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.980]   It's it's it's not even so much ambition so much is that really is.
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:04.220]   I think that's that's how they define the win.
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:12.020]   I think they define the win as iOS continues to dominate iOS continues to to move the bar.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:15.860]   I don't at this point, I don't think that they they've stopped caring about Mac.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:20.060]   I don't think I've ever thought that they stopped caring, but without visual visual
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:22.020]   feedback about about that.
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.900]   But I do think that when they think about what is their product?
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:32.260]   What is what encapsulates everything that Apple does well, which is design interface
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:38.900]   and creating creating the best interface between a CPU and a human brain possible.
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:41.180]   I really think that that's where their love is.
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:42.180]   That's where their passion is.
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:43.900]   Their passion is in the iPad right now.
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:44.900]   Yeah, it's clear.
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:52.700]   If you think if you think about it, I still think that the $329 iPad is very much the culmination
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:57.380]   of the initial dreams that Apple had creating the very first Mac makes up thing super friendly,
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:00.020]   super portable, super affordable.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:03.580]   And I really think that that's where that that part of the Apple spirit has found its
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:04.580]   home.
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:09.100]   All right, let me take a break and then we will get you pics of the week unless there's
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.260]   actually I'll give you one last chance.
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:14.820]   Anything else that happened at the event or the new products that you want to talk about
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:18.660]   before we go to our pics of the week, I'll just add that I think it's no coincidence that
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:22.500]   they had Angela Aaron's up there to talk about retail because I think they're increasingly
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:26.940]   they know that these products are expensive compared to the rest of the market.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:30.460]   And they want to sort of establish that it's not it's in their best interest to establish
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:31.460]   that it's not price.
[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:35.220]   It's not a price comparison that they want they are charging a premium, but they feel
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:39.620]   like they are delivering value way beyond the costs of the device.
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:41.940]   And part of that is Apple care, but also part of it.
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:45.580]   They announced I forget the number, but there was a ton of new courses and it's not just
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:47.700]   you know, introduction to IM movie anymore.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:50.540]   It's like this is how we prototype new devices at Apple.
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:53.860]   And this is how you get started with coding and all of that is free.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:57.700]   So like once you do buy and if you again, if you have an Apple store near you, once you
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:02.220]   do buy in the value that you get with that product is an ongoing thing.
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:07.140]   And they're stressing that as much as Apple music or photos or any other service.
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:08.140]   My kids.
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:09.140]   My kids.
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:11.140]   I thought that was good.
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:13.700]   Alex first then Andy.
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:20.100]   I was going to say is that my kids went to a garage band on the iPad class at the Apple
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:24.580]   store and they came back and I was doing something else and I said, who is this band?
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:26.580]   And my daughter said, that's me.
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:27.580]   Wow.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:28.580]   I did that.
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:33.060]   You know, like I was just like, holy smokes, you know, my son played and my son played
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.380]   some music that he put together.
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:37.460]   And it was really well structured and put together and I was like, you got that out of
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:40.020]   one class at Apple and they were like, yeah, it was fun.
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:43.900]   You know, like their grandmother takes them to the Apple store to let them that's part
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:47.260]   of like instead of going to the playground, sometimes they go to the go to the Apple store
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:49.820]   and take classes and it's the classes are really good.
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:50.820]   They look crazy.
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:54.220]   I was super man, at least in the big city stores like our San Francisco store, they've
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.260]   got big names coming in to do that.
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:58.260]   Really pretty impressive.
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:37:59.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:02.460]   I thought it was super interesting because this is the first time that she's had a slot
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:06.340]   in a keynote, but we're used to them saying that, Oh, and here's our brand new beautiful
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:07.340]   store.
[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:11.220]   Many customers that we helped over the course past the last year.
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:14.260]   And Oh, and here's we've been here is some new teaching things that we've been doing
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:15.260]   there.
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:21.380]   This is the first time they really had such a finely honed message to elevate the Apple
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:23.500]   stores almost as though they were another product.
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:27.660]   I think that the they talk more about the Apple store than they do to about the Mac mini.
[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:29.940]   They spent she was on stage for half an hour.
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.300]   And she were in her beautiful Burberry coat.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:33.900]   I know you can help a notice.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:40.780]   I love that she continues to fly the colors, but but the line that this is this is an Apple
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:41.780]   marketing line.
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:44.660]   So we'll book in that by saying this is a line that was carefully crafted, but it's
[01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:45.660]   a good one.
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:51.660]   So it's saying that the that she regards the Apple store as the the the genius bar and
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.780]   the sales, that's the hardware and the programs that they put on for the public is the software
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:58.380]   of this Apple product.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:03.140]   And just as you said, time, minute after minute after minute talking about these programs
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:09.660]   they were putting on in such in broad details and small details, really making the idea
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:11.500]   that this is we are create.
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:14.780]   If there's a zombie outbreak, if you have a certain if you've got the latest model of
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:19.420]   Apple watch, you will be given you will be given sanctuary inside your nearest flagship
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:20.420]   store.
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:24.300]   So perhaps you do want to upgrade to the new iPhone six with zombie zombie detection
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.300]   and evasion.
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:29.460]   It does make me though, start to worry.
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:34.780]   And I think it's already maybe happened that Apple is increasingly all of Apple's products
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:38.220]   and the stores to are increasingly for the affluent.
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:44.380]   And they really are no longer a product for real people, normal people there.
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:51.900]   It's it is very much a high end experience all around it is it is for it's for rich people.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:55.380]   I think it's mitigated like the Gruber has a great line where it's affordable luxury
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:57.180]   and that's it's sort of true of all.
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:59.340]   I remember what I mean affordable.
[01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:03.340]   No, but when you go down like so their new top end products are all expensive, but then
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:07.260]   you go down to that 329 iPad that Andy mentioned.
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:10.340]   And you know, there is enough of those still filtering down where they have like the year
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:14.420]   old or the two year old iPhone to sort of fill it not completely, but they sort of fill
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:19.060]   in the umbrella under it and Gruber calls it affordable luxury and it's not totally affordable,
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.060]   especially not for everybody.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:24.500]   The Andy's point earlier, but they do sort of seem conscious like with their chips.
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:27.620]   I think Apple's got like this very unified psyche where they realize that when things
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:30.140]   go up, it leaves too big a gap underneath.
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:34.340]   And then over time that iPad with the pencil comes in and fills that and then the next
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:35.940]   thing comes in and fills that.
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:36.940]   It's elitist.
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:39.820]   But here's but here's but here's an important point.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:45.660]   The would the $329 iPad that's Apple pencil compatible with all this wonderful software,
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:50.580]   would it exist if they were not getting their butts handed to them in the education market
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:51.580]   by Chromebooks?
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:56.060]   I'm not so sure that they would have been really, really that well motivated to say let's make
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:01.660]   it really let's make it a price competitive iPad that we can sell to schools.
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:06.740]   They are a business and I said before about how the ultimate goal of any company is to
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:11.820]   maintain their independence and part of it is maintaining being competitive.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:17.060]   But I think that we're getting that is a peek into the sort of laptops we would see.
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:24.020]   If Apple suddenly saw that we are getting these that Dell and HP laptops that cost $800
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:28.340]   are eating our lunch when it comes to photo editing, when it comes to creative arts, when
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:32.980]   it comes to things that we are making a lot of money off of, then that's when you'd see
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:34.620]   that guess what?
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:37.540]   We found a way to put a headphone jack on this or guess what?
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:40.340]   We decided to put an HDMI jack inside your laptops.
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:42.060]   You don't have to walk around with a dongle.
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:47.420]   So that's just they are under their under no responsibility to make machines for every
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:49.860]   economic range out there.
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:55.340]   I'm just saying that when you talk about great companies designing great products, give Apple
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:42:01.420]   it's due for producing a really brilliant $1,200, $1,300 laptop, but also give companies
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:06.060]   like Google and Samsung credit for creating a world in which you can do a really good
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.660]   $2,000 or $3,400 laptop.
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:14.260]   I also think that Apple, I think it's less aspirational that they want to be a product
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:18.420]   for the affluent and more of a looking at the reality of who buys their product for a long
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.420]   time.
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:21.940]   It's not for the last 10 years.
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:29.620]   So, as Android has grown and PCs were always there, what Apple was really good at was giving
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:33.300]   you this incredible ecosystem for a price.
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:39.140]   People who valued their time more than their money tended to buy a Mac.
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:45.900]   That's why I have had a Mac for a long time because I value my time.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:50.780]   And so, it's not that I don't have, I have Linux boxes and I have PCs and I have all
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:55.820]   kinds of stuff around, but my day-to-day stuff is stuff that I know is just mostly going
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:58.020]   to work.
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:03.540]   I think that Apple may have, I don't think it's like they've decided we're only interested
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:04.540]   in the affluent.
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.980]   I think that they're looking at the people who buy stuff.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:11.100]   They're finding that people aren't buying the base version of their phones.
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.780]   They're not buying the base version of their iPad.
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:17.020]   That market isn't there.
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:18.980]   They're just not selling that.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:19.980]   They don't go to Apple.
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:20.980]   I don't know those products.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:23.340]   Yeah, they don't buy the 8Gig version.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:26.180]   They buy the 16Gig or they buy the 32Gig.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:29.780]   And so, I think Apple is following in many ways, just following the consumers that they
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:32.340]   have down that path.
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:37.380]   And I think that consumer base is also why they're not going to be reporting their unit
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:42.020]   sales anymore because that consumer base has a lot more money to work with and they
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:46.580]   can move towards services towards that consumer base as opposed to...
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:49.500]   And I think it's less Steve and more Tim.
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:50.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:52.300]   It does make sense though.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:55.620]   You might as well say, "Let's talk about how much money per customer we're making instead
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:57.780]   of how money iPhones will sell."
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:01.700]   Because the customers, because Apple's customers spend a lot more money per person than Android
[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:02.700]   customers.
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:04.700]   By a long time.
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:09.220]   I'll say the only time that this, that it really annoys me, not having these low-end
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:15.140]   price machines, is when Apple does the...
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:18.780]   We think that technology has the power to change the world.
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:23.460]   And that's when I have to add the asterisk saying, "Yeah, but only for people who've
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:24.700]   got a couple thousand dollars."
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:34.260]   It's the only time that I will get persnickety about it is when the Raspberry Pi is a world
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:37.380]   change in computer on so many levels.
[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:38.380]   And Apple...
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:44.860]   And I know that it has an amazing number of fans inside Apple because 30 bucks for that
[01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:48.660]   much opportunity for schools, for education, for...
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:50.500]   Anyway, it's just...
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:54.780]   I would make the point that the Raspberry Pi over the past 10 years is as significant
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:56.780]   as any computer that Apple's...
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:57.780]   Yep.
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:58.780]   Or anybody else.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:44:59.780]   I agree 100%.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:00.780]   Yep.
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:01.780]   Let's take a break speaking of affluent.
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.580]   I'm going to talk about my toilet.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:08.220]   But when we come back...
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:10.900]   It's your fault, Alex Lindsey, our picks of the way.
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:11.900]   How ironic.
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:12.900]   How ironic.
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:13.900]   I know.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:14.900]   This is not...
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:15.900]   It's the Apple of Toilet.
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:16.900]   It is the Apple of Toilet.
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:19.540]   I'm talking about my toto-washlet toilet.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:24.740]   Makes every trip to the bathroom a trip to the spa.
[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:26.780]   That's perfect.
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:27.780]   You got to trademark that.
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:29.540]   It kind of is too, right?
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:32.780]   You go in the toilet seat rises to welcome you.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:33.780]   It's heated.
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:34.780]   It's warm.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:36.460]   You sit down on it.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:43.460]   Afterward, you get a lovely warm water bath and you get blow dried and then you wander
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.780]   off and it handles the rest.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:46.780]   You haven't touched a thing.
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:48.020]   You're just happy.
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.820]   That's the toto-washlet in a nutshell.
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:50.820]   It is easy, though.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:53.340]   I have to say they do offer a variety of price points.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:57.140]   It's easy to take your existing toilet, put a toto-seat on it for just a few hundred
[01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:00.820]   bucks and get this experience or get a whole new toilet.
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:03.260]   It is the best experience you've ever had.
[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:06.580]   Alex Lindsey talked me into getting this.
[01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:09.740]   I was very skeptical, right, Alex?
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:10.740]   You were.
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:14.420]   Lisa was even more skeptical, but I trust you.
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:15.620]   You've never started me wrong.
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:20.540]   Alex, it may be for the Heston Cupots, but we'll talk about that later.
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:21.620]   You've never started me wrong.
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:26.340]   He said, "Well, Alex, and I have to admit, you experience these in Japan, which is where
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:27.340]   they started."
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:29.100]   I think it's there.
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:30.740]   You got used to it.
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:31.740]   Well, that's it.
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:32.740]   Good one.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:36.260]   I hate to leave home because I miss my toilet.
[01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:38.140]   I miss my bed and I miss my toilet.
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:39.140]   That's it.
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:43.540]   The rest of you, I don't care about it so much, but my toilet, I miss.
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:48.740]   It's such an upgrade to your bathroom.
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:52.460]   Every model has a different range of things.
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:56.580]   Some models will have a pre-missed spray that spritzes your toilet bowl, keeps it clean
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:57.780]   before use.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:01.060]   There's models with Ewater+ electrolyzed water.
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:06.740]   There's a lot of different features, but the basic feature, the key feature is this amazing
[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:09.500]   toilet.
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.380]   For one of a better word, butt washer.
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:14.820]   It's fantastic and you will be cleaner.
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:16.180]   You will feel better.
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:20.060]   It's better for the environment because you don't use toilet paper.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.180]   You don't kill trees.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:22.900]   It's just fantastic.

[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:56.180]   Well, people were going into our bedroom to use the bathroom.
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:59.620]   They were going into the master because they wanted to try our todos.
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:02.260]   We said, "We'll better get one for the guest room."
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:04.660]   You will love this innovative toilet seat.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.860]   It will change the way you experience clean.
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:11.140]   Frankly, it's the future as far as I'm concerned.
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:15.460]   You'll look back on the old way and say, "What were we, savages?"
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:16.460]   Savages?
[01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:17.460]   Yeah.
[01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:20.780]   I think I said this the last time, but the best quote was from this woman.
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:29.980]   It was working on a way systems in the emerging world and NPR asked her why she uses.
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:30.980]   What does she use?
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:36.980]   She goes, "Oh, I use one of those Japanese toilets because I don't clean my dishes with
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:37.980]   dry towels."
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.980]   It says it all.
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:40.980]   It says it all.
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:41.980]   That's pretty much it.
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:45.820]   Once you get used to it, you can't go back.
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:50.060]   Wayfair, W-A-Y-F-A-I-R, Wayfair.
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:51.060]   Wayfair.com/Macbreak.
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:54.740]   They've got them all, all the models, starting at just a few hundred dollars all the way
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:57.900]   up to the big boy, the fancy one.
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:01.900]   But if you use the Afrikaans Macbreak, you get some special offers.
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:05.060]   Macbreak, Wayfair.com/Macbreak.
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:11.180]   Total will make it easy to find the one that's right for you and your bottom.
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:13.660]   Let us get some, oh, I want to start because it is Election Day.
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:16.940]   I encourage everybody to vote and here's a little something I might do.
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:19.900]   I think that you must, did you find this, Carsten?
[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:23.220]   It's called polls.pizza.
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:25.620]   Send pizza to the polls.
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:29.860]   Waiting in line for hours to vote, Tummy's Gromblin pizza to the polls is here to help.
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:31.140]   Send us reports of long lines.
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:33.300]   We'll send in the delicious reinforcements.
[01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:39.900]   They use slice to find a pizza place near the poll and you can donate to encourage people
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:40.900]   to vote.
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:41.900]   I love this idea.
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:44.100]   I'm going to send them a hundred bucks right now.
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:48.940]   Polls, five pizzas, polls.pizza.
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:51.660]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:53.620]   So my first one was just more fun.
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.940]   It's not a Mac product, but I thought I would show it.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:58.900]   This is the, the hydrogen.
[01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:02.700]   Oh, this is the craziest phone ever for rent.
[01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:04.900]   Have you, have you, have you played with it?
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:05.900]   We have one for review.
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:06.900]   Jason Howell has one.
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:08.780]   I love it.
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:09.780]   You love it?
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:11.700]   It's the dopiest thing ever.
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:12.700]   Come on.
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:13.700]   I love it.
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:14.700]   I love 3D.
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:15.700]   Okay.
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:16.700]   I love 3D phones.
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:18.300]   So I mean, 3D cameras.
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:19.580]   I have a lot of 3D cameras.
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:20.580]   I love stereo.
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:24.620]   When I was a kid, I had the little, you know, this phone is so big it has pistol grips on
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:25.620]   the sides.
[01:50:25.620 --> 01:50:27.580]   I know, but it's a good design.
[01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:32.020]   It's the easiest, it's the easiest phone to take 3D pictures that I've ever had.
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.180]   I mean, easiest camera to take 3D pictures.
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:37.220]   I had the old member, the Fuji made, I think it was a W3.
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:39.220]   Ws3.
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:40.220]   It was the second one, Ws1.
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:42.380]   They got out of that market.
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:46.140]   And if you just, I don't, I didn't put a sim in it.
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:49.980]   You know, I don't, it's just, it, all it does it for me is I wander around taking 3D photos
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:52.780]   and 3D movies and, and I enjoy that.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:56.100]   So anyway, so if you'd like, if that's something that you like, it's, it's a really fun, I'm
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:58.420]   not recommending it because it is silly.
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:50:59.420]   I bought it.
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:00.420]   So I don't see anything.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:01.420]   You bought it?
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:02.420]   So I just kind of share.
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:03.420]   Oh, that's right.
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:04.420]   You ordered it.
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:05.420]   You had to order it right away.
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:06.420]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.420]   But the cool thing I wanted to say.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:08.420]   This is a holdover.
[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:09.420]   I did.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:10.420]   And I got a one.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:13.820]   So I got, so I got a letter that said, your titanium with the bad news is your titanium
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:14.980]   was not coming till the spring.
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:17.420]   The good news is we're going to send you an aluminum one and then we're going to send
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.880]   you a titanium one in the spring.
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:20.880]   You can keep the aluminum one.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:26.180]   So now it's not, now I'll have two phones for that I don't need.
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:27.180]   Quite the fun.
[01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:29.300]   But they shoot 3D anyway.
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:30.300]   So it's fun.
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:31.300]   It's fun.
[01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:34.020]   And I think the people, the 3D stuff is pretty fun.
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:36.300]   I mean, it's, it's a fun thing to do.
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:37.580]   And I don't know what I'll do with it.
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:41.180]   But if someone had a really good view master app, I would send them photos.
[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:42.180]   Yeah.
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:43.180]   I think that's what they should do.
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.180]   That's kind of what it is.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:45.740]   It's like a, it's like a lenticular 3D.
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:49.340]   It's not, it's like the Jesus following you around pictures, right?
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:50.340]   It is.
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:51.820]   But you know, what I'm left with is wanting to share it.
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:52.820]   You know, I want to share those.
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:53.820]   Where do you share it to?
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:54.820]   Like nowhere.
[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:55.820]   Yeah.
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:56.820]   No, they have a little, there's a little social.
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:59.500]   There's a little app on it that's social that you can send it to.
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:02.900]   And you look at other people's shots and some of them are amazing, you know, that they've,
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:06.860]   you know, and you start figuring out, because there's a way to shoot 3D that makes it look
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:07.860]   better.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:08.860]   And so you get to play with it.
[01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:09.860]   And it's just an issue.
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:12.300]   It's a JPEG with just exit information on how to turn into 3D.
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:16.820]   So it's not like in five years time, I won't have, I won't have pictures of like my child's
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:22.860]   first steps because, oh, well, daddy spent $1,500 on a camera that uses a 3D format that
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:24.860]   they've totally forgot about.
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:27.740]   Oh, they're going to, they're going to be able to, right now it's all embedded in the
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.300]   metadata, but they'll be able to swap it.
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.460]   They'll be able to pull it apart.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:31.820]   So it'll be, it'll be fun.
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:36.300]   I'm surprised that red didn't hold off on releasing the phone until they released like a lens
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.860]   that pops onto those pogo pins.
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:40.780]   It's the pogo pins that make that a really interesting phone.
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:42.900]   That chips that would be five years old by that Andy.
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:43.900]   Yeah.
[01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:47.700]   And the thing is, is that red, you know, when you buy into red, you just know you're, you're
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.340]   kind of going along for the ride.
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:52.500]   You're not, the early cameras were a mess too.
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:57.100]   I mean, you know, it's, and so, so it's, it's part of the adventure, you know, when you,
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:02.260]   when you read, you know, it's anyway, so anyway, so let's, my actual recommendation,
[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:09.620]   I was asked to be interviewed on a podcast called Unstructured and, which was really
[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:10.620]   fun.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:13.620]   I think it'll come out in a couple of weeks.
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:14.620]   I'll tweet it.
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:18.620]   But we're using a squad cast FM.
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:24.500]   And so, you know, this is a, I actually found it to be, you know, a lot of fun.
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:31.340]   And, and it's a, so basically what you can do is you can invite folks and you can bring
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.700]   them in to do a podcast.
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:34.260]   Now what it does is it double ends.
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:38.460]   So what that means, of course, is that it's recording on their computer.
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:41.660]   And then when it's done, it uploads a wave file back to you to do an edit.
[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:48.580]   So you get all the individual, you know, I so so you can do up to four people, a host
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:50.020]   and three people.
[01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:52.940]   And for a lot of folks, you know, it was just two of us.
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:56.460]   Eric Hunley is the, is the, was the host for the show.
[01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:58.420]   And he's the, he's the host of Unstructured.
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:00.540]   And, and I had never seen it before.
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:03.420]   I don't know, Leo, if you've seen it before, but I have seen it before.
[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:04.420]   And it was real.
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:05.620]   I was like, this is really cool.
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:07.980]   We use this instead of Skype.
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:10.060]   No, no, it doesn't do.
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.420]   I don't think it does.
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:13.420]   It's really a standalone thing.
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:17.580]   And it's really, it does video interviews, but I don't think it does for, and I don't
[01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:20.300]   think it does, you know, I don't think it's really built for that.
[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:25.220]   We did see, I saw a small video bits and pieces, but if you're doing a podcast and you're not
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:29.340]   using a lot of video, you know, I don't see any way for it to broadcast.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.860]   So for the live portion of what we do, it wouldn't work.
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:35.860]   But if you're doing, you know, old fashioned podcasts where you're interviewing folks,
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:38.340]   one of the complaints that we've always had is that you can't double end.
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:43.700]   And it's hard to, you know, you can't double end it and you can't, but the other thing
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:47.060]   that's interesting is when you pop it open, when you see the other person, you can see
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:49.460]   everything about their, you know, their connections good.
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.300]   You can see what kind of processor they're using.
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:54.820]   You can see, you know, so it grabs a bunch of information so that you really know what's
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:55.820]   going on.
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:59.940]   It's going to complain too when you're trying to DX someone's, the problem on the other
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:01.340]   side, you don't know what they're using.
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:03.180]   And sometimes they don't know what they're using.
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:09.340]   And so, so it's, if you're doing audio podcasts and I would definitely take a look at it.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:10.900]   I think it's like 20 bucks a month.
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:14.860]   So you know, you got to, it's got to be something that you're more than a hobby.
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:21.100]   But, but I think that it is a, it looks like a great tool to, to do those audio podcasts
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:24.260]   and get back that full wave file from their side as well.
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:26.780]   And then you just limit it to whether they have a good mic or not.
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:32.460]   So that's, um, squad cast.fm.
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:34.980]   Thank you, Alex and your pick of the week.
[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:40.420]   A tip and then maybe a pick that maybe Renee would find particularly interested in.
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:46.860]   Like you said earlier, my, the internal SSD of my 2015 Macbook Pro went home to Jesus
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:48.980]   a couple of days, a couple of weeks ago.
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:51.940]   Of course, on the afternoon before I was, but the afternoon I was supposed to be boarding
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:54.180]   a plane, a train for New York.
[01:55:54.180 --> 01:56:00.460]   So there was a lot of, again, and one of those heavy curse words, sort of afternoons.
[01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:05.300]   So I thought I'd take this opportunity to go over just a few quick things that are you
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:10.260]   known for a long time, but you need to hear them a certain number of times for you.
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:11.260]   Believe them.
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:15.740]   Number one, this was totally not an issue for me because I had a complete backup.
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:21.860]   If I lost anything, I lost maybe one or two files that I haven't even identified.
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:27.860]   Because I am always, always, always making back full backups when it became very, very
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:31.900]   clear that I was not going to be able to restore this SSD very, very quickly.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:37.980]   I just simply plugged in an external, I have an external SSD in an enclosure that is the
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:39.700]   same size as my internal.
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:45.500]   It just does, I use super duper by, by a pocket software and it just simply does a complete
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:49.100]   bootable image and I was back up and running immediately.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:55.620]   So again, you believe people will keep telling you to backup, backup, backup, but you don't
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:57:00.780]   let this happen to you where you only believe it after you lost everything and you didn't
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:04.420]   have a backup of the stuff you've been doing for the past two or three months.
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:07.020]   Just storing some stuff on Dropbox is not good enough.
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:11.940]   You will find out that you have been undisciplined and you did store some things that were not
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:14.660]   in the Dropbox folder that you lost.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:20.980]   One thing has to do with SSDs, if you are elderly enough that you grew up with spinning
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:27.020]   hard disk drives, so that would be anybody born after 2003, 2004.
[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:31.660]   Just remember that SSDs do not degrade the same way that hard disks do.
[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:35.980]   With hard disks, you're used to, if they fail, they fail mechanically and catastrophically
[01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:37.340]   and all at once.
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:40.620]   With SSDs, they are, they are like our own human bodies.
[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:43.540]   They are in a constant state of dying.
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:48.900]   As you keep writing to these memory locations, they keep basically, there are a limited number
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:50.860]   of read writes in them.
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:57.380]   And so the controller in the operating system is in a constant state of identifying bad
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:01.620]   blocks or bad, bad block, things are going to go bad, sealing them off, copying the data
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:05.140]   off of that into a fresh area of the SSD.
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:10.580]   So what you need to do is that at some point it's going to start showing signs that you'll
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:15.500]   drag something from the finder, either offer onto it, like a thousand files or something,
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:18.740]   and we'll say the operation could not be completed because some files could not be read
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:19.740]   or written.
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:24.020]   That is the sign that there are some really, really bad blocks going on and that your SSD
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:28.820]   is not about to die, but that is the extra kick in the pants to make sure that if you
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:33.740]   ignored me the first time you heard the line, make sure you back up all the time.
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:39.340]   It is time to do a full backup because sometime in the next year or so, this thing is probably
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:41.980]   going to go 100% failure.
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:49.220]   And also now you have to kind of anticipate that your SSD is going to last for safety,
[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:51.820]   figure the last two years before it'll start to screw up.
[01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:55.660]   I would not count on it lasting beyond three years.
[01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:58.220]   And I know a lot of people are probably going to be tweeting at me saying, "Oh, I've had
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:01.500]   an SSD, so we'll work for four or five years, still working great, good for you."
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:06.340]   But I'm saying that if you want to not be disrupted by a failure, once your SSD is a
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:10.580]   few years old, consider replacing it just as a matter of course.
[01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:13.820]   So keep those two things in mind when you're working with SSDs.
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:16.020]   Like I said, I didn't lose anything because I backed up.
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:21.900]   And also I was anticipating this for a little while because I was getting those errors.
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:27.540]   I did not anticipate it as such a degree that I already bought a replacement SSD to
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:30.060]   swap in, so I'm going to have to buy that.
[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:35.100]   But just again, if you don't want to lose data, do all this sort of stuff.
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:39.540]   And a quick actual pick, Renee, I know is a big fan of Hermes.
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:43.140]   I came across this book, was a $2 deal on Amazon a couple of weeks ago, and I've been
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:44.140]   just reading it now.
[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:48.580]   It's a wonderful book called Bringing Home the Birkin, My Life in Hot Pursuit of the
[01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:52.820]   World's Most Coveded Handbag by Michael Tonello.
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:55.540]   It's about this guy who moved to Barcelona for a new job.
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:58.900]   The job actually fell apart before he even moved there.
[01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:03.060]   And so he started selling some of his own designer clothes on eBay while he figured
[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:04.820]   out what kind of job he wanted to get.
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:11.740]   And this drew him into the world of like Hermes collectors and started off by buying and
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:17.740]   selling scarves and then got him into the Holy Grail of locating these Birkin bags that
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:24.260]   are like diamonds where they, Hermes keeps the stock artificially low to increase their
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:25.260]   demand.
[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:26.260]   You could get on a waiting list.
[02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:29.700]   You're told this will take two years before you'll be at the top of the waiting list.
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:32.620]   But there are ways he finds out to get them.
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:34.580]   And once you get them, you've got apps.
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:39.380]   You've got something that is incredibly rare that incredibly wealthy women want to own
[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:40.500]   in quantity.
[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:44.420]   And so he found and he was very, very well motivated to find solutions to this.
[02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:45.860]   I'm nearly done with the book.
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:46.860]   Very, very entertaining.
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:51.060]   It's a really good commuter book, assuming you don't drive yourself to work and back
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:56.020]   because it's not like a Neil Gaiman book where if you don't remember who is what and
[02:00:56.020 --> 02:01:01.140]   where they are because it was two days between the last time you read it, you're kind of
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:02.140]   going to be stuck.
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:04.500]   Everything to dip into every couple of days.
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:05.940]   Very, very entertaining.
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:07.340]   And I recommend it highly.
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:09.580]   If you're an Apple fan, you know about the Birkin.
[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:12.100]   Let me tell you, dude, one of the same.
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:13.780]   This is an ugly ass bag.
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:15.020]   That's all I could say.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.660]   Now let's move on.
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:18.660]   The money is very, very pretty.
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:20.580]   Very, very pretty money.
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:21.900]   You take the bag.
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:27.260]   Let's move on to Renee Richie, who probably has a Birkin watch band.
[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:28.260]   No.
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:29.260]   So three quick comments.
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:30.980]   One, I got to play with the hydrogen phone too.
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:32.340]   And it made me think of the fire phone.
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:35.820]   And I wish these eccentric billionaires would just like, all they want from Amazon is a
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:36.820]   shopping phone.
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:37.900]   All they want from red is a camera phone.
[02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:41.820]   I don't need your stupid screen technology that just makes those phones late and annoying.
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:44.420]   Just give me the ultimate camera on a phone red.
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:45.740]   Please and thank you.
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:49.180]   And after the event, a bunch of us got to check out Flight Club.
[02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:51.100]   And I didn't realize it was a sneaker culture.
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:55.780]   Apologies, Matthew Panzorino, which is even crazier than Hermes or purse culture.
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:58.140]   But people spend like hundreds of thousands dollars on their sneakers.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:01:59.380]   I'll just leave it at that.
[02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:00.380]   Wait a minute.
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:02.820]   Did you say hundreds of thousands of dollars?
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:05.980]   They had like the back to the future of sneakers, which are like the auto lacing ones, which
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:06.980]   like $40,000.
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:10.780]   And then they had like these pair that only Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant had.
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:12.780]   And those are like more.
[02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:13.780]   Huge.
[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:17.460]   Anyway, people if I someone there's I think it was Michael Gartenberg said that if you
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:19.260]   can buy it, somebody collects it.
[02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:21.020]   Yeah, that's probably true.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:26.460]   Birkin bags started $11,900 just in case you're trying to say.
[02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:29.740]   There's also documentary on Netflix called sneaker heads that will explain all about
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:34.820]   that culture that with people who love things will love them to your own death and that
[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:37.100]   things death and that is that is that culture there.
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:38.100]   It's beautiful.
[02:02:38.100 --> 02:02:39.100]   It is.
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:42.580]   I mean, so my pick of the week, I just I wanted to pick something that was sort of exemplify
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:44.420]   the iPad Pro.
[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:45.420]   And it's an app.
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:46.420]   It's an app everyone's familiar with.
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:48.220]   It's called Procreate.
[02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:52.460]   And they have just they always they go all in the last year when they announced the new
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:54.100]   iPad Pro.
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.540]   They had the metal version just running so fast.
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:58.860]   And this year they've got the new pencil support.
[02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:03.340]   And with a pencil you can choose when you double tap it for notes, for example, to go
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:07.180]   between the pencil and the eraser or the previous tool and the new tool.
[02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:11.140]   But developers can overwrite that and Adobe showed off, for example, they overwrote it
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:14.620]   by doing pixel level zoom to full screen zoom.
[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:17.420]   Well, Procreate is just they gone bananas on it.
[02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:22.500]   You can double tap it and like pallets will swirl out around you and is all these different
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:24.460]   context sensitive menus.
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:28.020]   And the whole idea is that humans are really bad at changing context.
[02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:31.260]   It's why you forget things when you move between rooms like you go from the room to
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:32.260]   the kitchen.
[02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:35.380]   And because the room changed your brain is like, okay, dump the former cash, start a
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:36.380]   new cash.
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:37.780]   You have no idea what you were looking for anymore.
[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:41.500]   You got to go back and forth two times or you launched another app and you can't remember
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:43.540]   what you were doing or you move from keyboard to screen.
[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:45.420]   And you're like, why did I do that?
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:49.300]   So the more you can keep yourself in context, it's like why touch ideas so great because
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:52.700]   you're on the screen, you're on the keyboard, you can just tap it.
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:56.740]   This is so great because you're using the pencil and instead of having to stop and go
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:59.860]   searching for what you want, you tap the thing, you tap what you want, you go right back to
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:04.420]   working and it's just such an accelerator and such a great app.
[02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:08.860]   And they put so much effort into it and now you can like attach it to an external display
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:13.500]   and you can use all of that firepower in the A10.
[02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:19.060]   I'm going to say A10 10, sorry, A1210, but it's A12X processor.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:22.660]   And it's just, this is one of the apps that Rob McCullen was using for all the Star Trek
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:24.220]   stuff and all the Pacific Rim stuff.
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:31.620]   And it is so, for certain creative pros, there is absolutely no limitation at what the iPad
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:34.420]   can do right now, like forget all the other stuff.
[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:37.660]   But what they can produce on it is staggering and this is the kind of app that just, and
[02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:39.060]   I'll give credit to Microsoft too.
[02:04:39.060 --> 02:04:43.140]   Google has been really lackluster in their support for the iPad.
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:47.220]   Microsoft I think treats it even better than they treat Windows these days.
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:50.620]   And there are some phenomenal apps that you can get right now that really show off what
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:51.820]   these things can do.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:52.820]   Very nice.
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:54.540]   Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:59.140]   We do Mac break weekly on Tuesday's 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time.
[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:04.060]   1900 UTC, we've set our clocks back here in the United States.

[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:13.940]   They're also watching the live stream.
[02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:16.100]   Just go to irc.twit.tv.
[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:22.140]   You can also get on-demand copies of everything we do at our website, twit.tv/mbw for this
[02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:23.140]   show.
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:24.780]   And that's audio or video, your choice.
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:26.140]   Listen at your leisure.
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:28.220]   You know another way to do this?
[02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:33.780]   Use Marcos overcast or pocketcast or, you know, Stitcher, slacker.
[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:35.420]   Find a podcast app and subscribe.
[02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:40.820]   That way you'll have it the minute it's done, fresh off the presses, and you can listen
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:41.820]   whatever you feel like it.
[02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:46.020]   It's always nice to have a fresh Mac break weekly waiting for you on your phone.
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:47.020]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:05:47.020 --> 02:05:51.260]   We'll see you another time, but now I'm sorry to say it's time to get back to work because
[02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:52.260]   break time is over.
[02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:52.260]   Bye-bye.
[02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:52.740]   Bye-bye.
