[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.500]   Welcome to MacBreak Weekly. I am not Leo Laport.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   I am Meghan Moroni filling in for Leo Laport. Leo is in Las Vegas on vacation,
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.000]   but we will still spend the next very large chunk of time talking about everything Mac,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   some iPhone stuff, some iPad stuff, some updates, some betas, all the good stuff.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.500]   And of course, joining me today is the regular team.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.000]   Let's start with Andy Anatko from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.500]   How is your clutter desk of I things today, Andy?
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   Good enough that I can type on the...
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   Any word that doesn't involve OPL or punctuation, I can type, right?
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   So the clutter situation is well in hand-making.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   We've also got Renee Ritchie from I'more and Renee, I know exactly how much he's worked out.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   He appears to have showered since then, so that's good. I follow his activity on my Apple Watch.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   How's it going over there, Renee?
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   It's great. I mean, you did send Georgia Dow back here after we asked you to keep her.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   But other than that, the whole country is doing great.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   And of course, Alex Lindsay from Just Down the Road from Pixel Core.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   He is here with an excellent connection that we've been working on for a while.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   You look fantastic, Alex.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.500]   Thanks. I'm glad that I'm in sync now. So I'm feeling ready for the show.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   All right. Well, I think I'm ready. I don't know.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   I guess we just get right into it. That's the way that it happens when I watch or listen to it.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   So let's talk about the Apple iCloud hack, which has sort of been bubbling in the news for a while,
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.500]   and more little pieces are coming up.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   This, of course, was the allegedly the Turkish crime family that said they had.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   They said they had a bunch of your credentials, and they, unless Apple gave them a bunch of money
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   or a lot of iCloud or iTunes gift cards, they were going to brick people's phones or wipe them.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.500]   It wasn't even a lot of money. It's a billion, $500 billion company.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   The ask for $32 in iTunes cards.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.500]   And I think the important thing is if you're going to do something like this,
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.500]   it's really important to have your name not sound like a Disney cartoon.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   I think that's an important piece of the buzz.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   So does Turkish crime family sound like a Disney?
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500]   And they're from England. And I kind of know if they know the country or they mean the bird?
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   I was really confused.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   So should we be terrified?
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.500]   That's the reason.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   Should we be terrified of this?
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   It is completely farcical and we should be not terrified but concerned because what it looks like
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   they did is a bunch of different companies have been breached.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   We know this for years, like Home Depot, Yahoo's lost upwards of hundreds of millions of account details.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   This looks specifically like LinkedIn and Last FM databases.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   And people, even without thinking about it, use the same password.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   They write a password for LinkedIn and because they don't want to remember many passwords,
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   they use the same password for iCloud or the same password for Last FM.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   So they found these breaches. They decided to try them on iCloud, found that they worked.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   And then Bingo, they get into iCloud accounts.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   And they decided they wanted to make money off of this.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500]   And the fastest way they could think of was to say, "Apple, give us all your iTunes cards,
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   or we're going to wipe out and lock these accounts."
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   So iCloud has not been breached. No one's broken into Apple servers.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   But because despite all the education and the best practices and the warnings we give,
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.500]   people do reuse their passwords, there are going to be a lot of people whose accounts are now vulnerable.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   They might not even remember that they're vulnerable.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.500]   So I think don't be panicked, but unless you are absolutely sure your password is long, strong, unique,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   and generated with one password, last pass, or something else that can spit out pseudo-random chunks,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   go and change your password and please, please, please turn on two-factor authentication.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   Because that'll help prevent a lot of future shenanigans.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   I think the upshot of these stories is kind of like when you hear about a home fire somewhere near your town.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.500]   It doesn't mean that your house is the next to go, but it does remind you that,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   "Okay, when was the last time I changed the batteries of my smoke detectors?"
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   And, "Hey, wait, I bought the smoke detectors. My moved in here 12 years ago.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   Maybe I should replace them."
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   And every time there's a story like this about a breach of passwords, your name is right.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   It usually winds up being something that the humans did wrong,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   meaning you yourself choosing, "Okay, the last password I chose was 123456.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.500]   If I change the one to a letter I, that'll foil everybody."
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   And no, they'll get it.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   So that gives you an idea to think that maybe I should do an audit of my passwords
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   and either check to make sure that everything that I log into every single day
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   has a unique and really good password, or maybe if you're not using one password
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   or another password manager, this is a good time to start thinking about that.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   I don't even know how I survive without LastPass for me.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.500]   But whether it's one password or LastPass, we use it company-wide.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.500]   And there's so many passwords that are required.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   I don't understand how... I don't even know how...
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.500]   There's no way, really.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   What I guess what I would say is pick one, whether it's one password
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   or LastPass, pick a password manager, you gotta use one if you're
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.500]   gonna really do much on the internet because there's no way that you can create
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   a lot of passwords that you can remember for each site
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   unless you write them down, which of course defeats the whole idea.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   And I agree with Renee. Two factors.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   Important.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   We just have to realize that we're getting out of the time
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   when things were okay to...
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.500]   And you didn't have to be worried about this.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   You pretty much have to be worried about it all the time.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   You know, this is the next frontier of...
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.500]   It's just aware of this.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   So we just have to really understand that's going on.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.500]   It's like the real world that's aware of the post- screenshot.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   You would never have the same key for your house and your cottage
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.500]   and your kids' high school locker and your gym locker.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.500]   You just wouldn't use one key for that because if you lost it,
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.500]   people would suddenly get into everything.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.500]   And that's the real world example of this, just don't have the same key for all of your internet accounts.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   And it sounds ludicrous, but people think it's inconvenient and they don't like the idea.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.500]   But seriously, think about it like it's your house key.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500]   You want to make sure it's unique and it's really good.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   The weakness of humans is the historically funny underpinning of everything.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   It not only affects users who choose really bad passwords,
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   but it also means that even your bank and other services,
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   they understand that people hate passwords and they lose passwords.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.500]   And when someone's trying to hack a specific account,
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.500]   they can exploit, that person can exploit that by saying,
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:16.500]   "Hi, it's my wife who set up our iTunes account and we just set it up
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.500]   and she needs me to go do this, but I know she's told me to write it down,
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.500]   but I didn't write it down.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.500]   And so I have my address.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   I can give you my social security number proof.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   I am.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.500]   You just reset my password and change it to our new address because, oh, God,
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   we changed from Google Mail to Apple because the Google Mail is doing so badly.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.500]   And because these tech support people are basically programmed to say,
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.500]   "Oh, people are idiots.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.500]   They forget passwords.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.500]   This happens all the time."
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   They go into, "Oh, don't worry, sir.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.500]   We'll help you.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   We'll change your email address to this new address you've given me.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.500]   We'll reset your password and send you an email address to reset it."
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.500]   It really is a big flu-but-new situation.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.500]   Okay.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.500]   So long passwords, strong passwords, password manager, two-factor.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   Do you also think you should regularly change your password?
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   Do any of you have some sort of maintenance where every two months or three months
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.500]   or once a year you go through and change your most important passwords?
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.500]   I used to because if we worked in an enterprise, we had policies, we had an exchange server,
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.500]   and the exchange server would mandate that you change it every so often.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.500]   But again, like to Andy's point, humans ruin everything because they would just,
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   they would figure out the minimum number of passwords you could cycle,
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   write them down on a piece of paper literally on top of their desk,
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   and then just go, "Okay, dash, dash six comma."
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.500]   And then just use that one again.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.500]   So I think it's important to do it.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.500]   Like, I try to get people to do it once a year because that doesn't seem too inconvenient.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.500]   But I think the company is, like, right now if you change my cloud password,
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.500]   it's theoretically transparent, but it really, it starts hitting a lot of services.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.500]   And then every phone, every iPad, every Mac you have,
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   sometimes FaceTime and iMessage will ask you separately, sometimes iCloud Drive will.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.500]   And it becomes a lot of overhead.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.500]   So I think absolutely if you have a reason for concern, like there is a breach like this
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   of unrelated accounts that happen to the same password and you're not 100% sure,
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.500]   change your password.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   Otherwise, make it national password change day in your house every new year
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.500]   or every spring cleaning day and then do it as a family as part of that product.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.500]   I have to admit, I tend to update it sitting when I'm waiting for planes.
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   You know, like, "Oh, I have nothing to do and so I'll change a bunch of passwords."
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.500]   And that's, I don't know if that's the best.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.500]   I only do it, by the way, when I change those passwords, being a little paranoid myself,
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.500]   I only do it when I'm connected via my phone or something.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500]   I won't use the airport Wi-Fi.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.500]   That's probably not.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   To me, that's a big open gate.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.500]   I do set a recurring item on my calendar for really,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.500]   like my bank password, my main email password, my private servers,
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.500]   those are things where I do have an email, an email alert that pops in to say,
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.500]   "Oh, by the way, have you changed, have you changed these passwords?"
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   I don't change everything, but nonetheless, if you're not diligent,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.500]   there are times where things auto-complete and auto-fill-in makes you forget
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.500]   that maybe you chose this password eight years ago before you decided that four letters
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.500]   is no longer strong enough.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.500]   And so you'll be surprised that I was still using a really old password on something
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.500]   that was not important when I signed up for this nine years ago,
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.500]   because I signed up for it just to try it out.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.500]   But now I found myself using it over and over and over again, and that's when I realized,
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   "Oh, perhaps it shouldn't be that name of that movie character that everybody knows I like."
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500]   And, you know.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.500]   Google bought that financial investing company.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   Maybe Logan shouldn't be my password.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.500]   [laughter]
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.500]   So, okay, our next story is pretty similar, I think, with your advice, Andy,
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.500]   is just because there's a fire somewhere.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.500]   Maybe you should check your smoke detectors.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.500]   It's the Vault 7, the dark matter, the WikiLeaks that keeps coming out.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.500]   There was another dump last week that was more directed at Apple.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   Hold in iOS.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.500]   The Sonic screwdriver, which I've learned, is from Dr. Who.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   Thank you, everyone.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   Yes.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.500]   So much here.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.500]   So, is this WikiLeaks information something we should worry about, or is it enough to say,
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.500]   "Get all your updates, get them regularly," and, again, use two factor?
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.500]   Yeah, this was pretty much a damn squib.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.500]   Most of the revelations are stuff that, if you basically gave me $10,000 to come up with a list of,
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:16.500]   as many hacks that have ever been worked, as many hacks as have ever worked on iOS and macOS devices
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   in the past 10 or 15 years, this is pretty much the list I would come up with.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.500]   A lot of these hacks only affect stuff that haven't been made for a few years,
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   or if you've got a machine that you haven't updated in any way, shape, or form for several years.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:35.500]   But it also really shows you exactly the breadth of ways that people have figured out to get into a machine,
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.500]   including if you've ever cracked open a firewire connector, or, excuse me,
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.500]   a Thunderbolt connector, or these other connectors,
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.500]   you find that's not just wires that go from the cable into the connector.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.500]   There's actually a controller of some sort in there that helps do the signaling,
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:57.500]   and so it's possible to create, because the logic board doesn't suspect that there might be anything
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.500]   weird going on with that controller, that's a good place to insert some code.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   And so, if you've got the right sort of gear, then that's definitely something you can do.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.500]   But whenever you feel that you're starting to get scared about how vulnerable your stuff is,
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.500]   number one, keep your stuff updated. Update not only your operating system,
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.500]   but also make sure you're running the proper security patches.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   Make sure that your browser is up to date.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.500]   Make sure even like your Microsoft Office installation is up to date.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.500]   That'll insulate you from most, if not all, of the stuff that is just sort of broad-based.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:33.500]   They've sought the bad people send up a flare, and any computer that is vulnerable
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.500]   got infected by these spores that the flares throughout.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.500]   That'll prevent you from that.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.500]   The things that you really can't prevent is people who have physical access to your machine
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.500]   and a little bit of privacy.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:52.500]   So, all these hacks they're talking about are if you manage to, if you leave your office for lunch
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   and someone has access to your machine for an hour, or even just five or ten minutes,
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:02.500]   they can install and insert some malware that will then give that person remote control
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500]   or remote observation.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:10.500]   When it comes to things like these hacked ports, we're talking about a compromised device
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.500]   that has to give to you and they have to trick you into physically taking this and plugging it in.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.500]   So, it's really not the sort of thing that you need to worry about unless you are working in the government,
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.500]   working for a big contractor, or as Alex often says,
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.500]   that when you go to travel overseas on business, you just set fire to,
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.500]   you don't bring anything private with you, and then the thing you buy to use while you're in Beijing,
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.500]   you set fire to it before you leave, you never take it with you.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   So, you're fine.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.500]   It's good to know, knowledge is power, but don't worry too much about it.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.500]   I'm actually more worried about WikiLeaks these days than I am about the stuff that they're leaking,
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.500]   because everything from their motivations to the way they choose to report stuff.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   We saw the horrible way that they leak the so-called breaking of end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.500]   and signal, which was completely not true.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.500]   So, again, physical access to a device and reading messages off those devices.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:08.500]   When I first saw this, it wasn't clear to me that these were old, understood vulnerabilities,
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.500]   that of course the CIA or anybody who wanted access to Macs would be using, you know, certainly by now,
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.500]   but from several years ago.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.500]   I think they've gotten very addicted to the attention that they get from these things,
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.500]   and that's factored.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   Sort of like consumer reports, that's factored into the way they choose to put it in the public eye now.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500]   So, do...
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   I don't have to raise money.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:33.500]   No, I know that when the first WikiLeaks came out, the first part of Vault 7,
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.500]   Julian Assange came out and said, "I'm going to be working with these companies."
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.500]   And when to, we'd be working with Apple to fix these vulnerabilities,
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.500]   which we've then learned are all fixed.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.500]   Do you think that he's actually in there talking to someone?
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.500]   I mean, do you think that they...
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.500]   Fix elections, fix vulnerabilities, fix everything.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.500]   I mean, I don't understand this anymore.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.500]   So, it's so depressed.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.500]   So, you don't think that he's actually talking to someone at Apple and working with them?
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   I mean...
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.500]   I don't think they're interested in talking to him about it.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.500]   I don't think they need to.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.500]   I think that most of these things, they probably already...
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.500]   As we already heard, they patched most of those things,
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   and even if they didn't, he hasn't given them enough information.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.500]   I don't think that...
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.500]   I think once...
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.500]   If they was something they hadn't patched, they either can't patch it in this current piece of hardware
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   or they have...
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.500]   They're now at a point where, as soon as you tell them that there's a vulnerability in this area,
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.500]   they can probably find it pretty quickly.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.500]   Well, I think talking about two-factor and updates,
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:33.500]   this would be a good segue to talking about the iOS updates that came through yesterday.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.500]   10.3 for your iPhone, for your iPad.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.500]   There was a new Apple Watch, new Apple TV.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.500]   Has everyone gotten their updates?
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.500]   I was so excited.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   I saw my Apple Watch update, and I was so excited that I might be able to have a watch face
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.500]   that had seconds on the digital readout, but no.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.500]   I'm still thinking I can't do that.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.500]   What does Apple have with the seconds?
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.500]   Yeah, you can't do seconds with timers, too, right?
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.500]   Like you can't set a timer, except for Siri.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.500]   Yeah, you just put it...
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   You know, like, I don't understand.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.500]   And then my whole thing is, I think my number one reason for wanting to design my own watch face
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.500]   is just so that I had a production level, you know, watch face that actually had seconds going on it.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.500]   Yeah, actually, if you want to have a timer go around, but if you need giant rings to go with it.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.500]   I don't want the giant rings.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.500]   I guess...
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.500]   But it gives you that...
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.500]   I think it moves most of the engineers under the Watch Band project.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.500]   They found themselves the short for all that might have fewer than 90 new Watch bands this year,
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.500]   so they said, "Boys, girls, I know that you're this close to cracking that seconds on the watch face problem,
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.500]   but we need a way to put blue and brown on the same band.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.500]   We know you're the people to do this."
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.500]   Isn't it delightful to build the translate?
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.500]   There's absolutely none.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.500]   There's absolutely none.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.500]   I'm certain that someone has made a decision that there shouldn't be seconds.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.500]   Like, it makes you nervous or it...
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.500]   Is it a battery issue?
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.500]   No, like I said, it's on the activity face.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.500]   They have seconds working fine.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   If you put on the ring face, you have seconds on there.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   You know, one, three rings.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.500]   I just want a black face with...
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.500]   I mean, there's no reason that you can do the other faces.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.500]   Yeah, the thing I find delightful is that they're localizing English now
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.500]   and they have automaker apps in some countries and car maker apps in others
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   and they have cinema mode in some countries and theater mode in others.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   And I think that they've gotten to the level now where everything else is so fixed that they can...
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.500]   Has anyone experienced like a rude Apple Watch user in a theater
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.500]   where their Apple Watch goes on often?
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.500]   No, it's the people who text from Samsung devices leaving the Bloopney Bloop's on.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.500]   It's the worst.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.500]   Like, they have the worst sounds and they're loud and people don't turn them off
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.500]   and they'll join the movie.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   They're like, "Doodlebloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop!"
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.500]   And you can locate them.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   It's so hard you can actually physically find them.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.500]   It's baffling to me.
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.500]   I've been that person.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.500]   Not texting, but yeah, where I did not realize that, of course, every time,
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   like, "Well, I'm applauding during a scene and my watch is blinking on off, on off, on off, on off."
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.500]   I wish I were joking, like, "Oh, my God, let's turn this..."
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.500]   I'm literally sitting like this until the intermission
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.500]   because it's a new watch and I can't remember how to turn that off again.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.500]   And because if you're in, like, live theater where everybody, almost everybody is really polite,
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:22.500]   anything that disrupts the audience is immediately marked for emulation or something.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   So, yeah, I'm glad I put that in.
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.500]   And it's not, it's really, if you're designing this thing, it would take you a while to realize
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.500]   that you need an ability to say, "Please don't shine this light under any circumstances."
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:43.500]   I don't want, I'm going to be seeing a show with Rita Moreno or somebody who, oh, I'm sorry, that's not her,
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.500]   but there are a couple of performers on Broadway who will just stop the show
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:53.500]   and start yelling at this person and then run into the audience and take the phone and just throw it,
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.500]   and yeah, you don't want to be that person.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.500]   That's not worth $300 for a watch.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.500]   Keep the watch, please.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.500]   It is interesting that this didn't come originally, that they didn't think of it,
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.500]   because I do remember the first time I was wearing my Apple Watch in a theater,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.500]   and it went on and, you know, I was super embarrassed.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.500]   So, it's good, but you actually have to, I mean, it's pretty easy to turn it on, it's just in the settings.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.500]   What do you call that swipe up menu in the app?
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.500]   Control center.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   The control center?
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.500]   Yep.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.500]   Yeah, and it's the little drama faces, so it's really easy to turn on.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.500]   Don't forget to do it if you're in a theater.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.500]   What about find my AirPods?
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.500]   Anyone use that so far?
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.500]   I did the fake version when I lost them in the snow the first time I had them,
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.500]   and then I turned up the music real, real loud and just walked around until I found them.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:41.500]   But this is so much more convenient because at a distance, it'll use the same sort of wireless location technology as find my iPhone.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.500]   So, I'm not saying I'm waiting for a chance to use it because I don't want to tempt fate.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.500]   I'm very Toby Z-Glitter that way, but I do like the fact that it's there now.
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.500]   Does it use the same?
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   I thought it used Bluetooth, so it's not exactly like find my friends, or is it?
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:01.500]   Well, so it will, depending on what is near it, I believe it will try to connect any way it can if you have other devices,
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.500]   or if it's at home and you have networks and things.
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.500]   I have to actually double check that, but yeah, as long as you're within Bluetooth proximity, it'll track you.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:17.500]   I read that if you're one of the things it does is it remembers here was the last place the phone was when it had contact with your AirPods.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:23.500]   So it's not necessarily tracking them directly, but it'll say that the last place that here is where we lost contact with your AirPods.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.500]   So at least you'll be able to say that I didn't leave them on the plane.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:33.500]   They must be somewhere in the house because the last time it was in contact with the AirPods was here in the house.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.500]   Yeah, from what I understand, it's like how Apple Maps knows where you park your car.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:43.500]   It's only because when you disconnected your phone from your car and your Bluetooth and it knows where your car is.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:50.500]   So if someone took your car and drove it somewhere else, Apple Maps would no longer know where your car was parked.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   So I think the Wi-Fi iPads, they can't tell because they don't have cellulars, they can only tell where they were last connected to an internet to a Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:05.500]   But what it does do, it'll play a sound and it plays a sound quietly just in case you left them in your ears and that's where they are.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.500]   So right away you won't.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:13.500]   I'm not a... I can imagine myself doing that. And then it plays a little bit louder.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:19.500]   And you can also just play it in the left or just play it in the right if you've just lost one of them.
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   That would be me walking on that. Where's my AirPods? Anyone see my AirPods? And they're just pointing at me.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.500]   I stopped pointing at me. Where am I?
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:34.500]   Literally, I was flying back from Rome last week and I had not slept for like 30 hours and I was sitting in Denver and I literally went into a panic attack trying to figure out what happened to my phone.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:41.500]   And I was holding it. I was like, I was laying in my hand. I was looking around and I was like, oh, they're mine.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.500]   Right, I've done that too. It's just a piece of you now, right?
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:50.500]   I know. I was literally surfing like flip board and then suddenly had a panic attack that I don't have my phone.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.500]   That's when you know you haven't had enough sleep for a little while.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.500]   So do any of you exercise with your AirPods?
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.500]   Yes. I don't have AirPods.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.500]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:08.500]   I have the free corded earbuds that come with my Sandis MP3 player that I bought last week.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.500]   I'm a print journalist and a rapidly collapsing market that I mentioned.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.500]   But you people please talk about your $170 earphone.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:23.500]   Well, I stop in every time I go to the Apple store, I stop in and I go, hey, by the way, do you have any earpods? AirPods? And they're like, no, come back later.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.500]   I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm just passing through.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.500]   You know, I'm just, so I'm waiting for it to reach saturation where I can actually buy them at the store.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.500]   Okay. Yeah, it took a couple months to get them.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:41.500]   But someone recommended recently to me these silicone tips for your AirPods because I like to run and these are my favorite pair of AirPods.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.500]   I mean, of earbuds, like I have a lot of Bluetooth, but I love that they just pair automatically.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.500]   And you know, when you're running by a neighbor and you want to say, hi, just pull it out and, you know, it stops.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.500]   So I'm going to try them. There's these little silicone tips.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.500]   I just, these were from the Australian eBay, but I looked on Amazon and ordered some.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.500]   So hopefully that will help.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.500]   They're Martian boar hats.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.500]   They look like little bunnies.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.500]   They do, aren't they?
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.500]   They're like, I think my view of Venus.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.500]   They're there peeps for your ears.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.500]   Exactly.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:19.500]   Okay. Anything else at CarPlay updates? Anything else exciting about the updates to?
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.500]   How about you Alex? Anything exciting about the updates to you?
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:30.500]   Is it new on the phone to have your phone to ring on the watch to have your phone ping as easily as it is now?
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.500]   Do they move that?
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   I was always in the control center for me because that little, were you pinging yours earlier?
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.500]   I thought I heard that sound.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.500]   I did by accident. I was like, I didn't have the control center.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.500]   Yeah, no, that is not new.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:50.500]   That is, I have to say one of my favorite features of the watch because you can find your phone, even when you're holding your hand.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.500]   For some reason I guess after my, after my update, all the little pages are gone.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   Hold on.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.500]   The pages.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:02.500]   So now I just have a control center, but I don't have, there was like, I had pages of things that I could look at other than my phone.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.500]   You know, when you scroll up from the, from the, from the, uh,
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.500]   in the control center.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.500]   In the control center before.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.500]   Oh.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.500]   It wasn't the control center that before, it used to be, maybe I've had, maybe I haven't updated for a long time.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:18.500]   Um, I don't know. I mean, my, you know, I have kind of a love hate relationship with my watch.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.500]   I think I'm always on the verge of going back to my citizen.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.500]   Like, you know, I'm just, it's just when the battery is dead, which is often.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.500]   Well, yeah, I got the bigger watch.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.500]   Go ahead.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.500]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:35.500]   I travel a lot and I just, it's just one of the things I travel a lot and you just get in this position where you can't,
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.500]   you can't get it charged, you know, because it's very, you know, and, and, um,
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.500]   and so it just ends up dead and you're at the airport and then I'm like, I don't know why I'm using this stupid thing.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   But then when people text you and it shows up and then you go back to going, okay, I'll keep it for a little while longer.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.500]   But I have to admit that I haven't taken full advantage of my watch.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.500]   Has everyone used the new podcast widget?
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.500]   I have hot.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.500]   iOS has widgets.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:01.500]   That's my relationship with iOS on widgets.
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   Yeah, it's, uh, I mean, you know, no, but none of you probably use the podcast app.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   Do you?
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.500]   You probably use it.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.500]   I do because I use it whenever I need Siri.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:17.500]   Like if I, if I just can't get to my phone and I want to say play Mac break weekly and then it'll just go and find it and start playing it for me.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.500]   I don't have to worry about using a different app or interface or anything.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.500]   Mm hmm.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:28.500]   And then of course, I don't think we mentioned that it's easier to, they remind you to do to turn on two factor now with iOS 10.3.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   Part of startup, I mean, this is so, this is such a big problem to solve.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:39.500]   So startup buddy is the system that comes on, sorry, setup buddy is the system that walks you through setting up an iPhone for the first time or going through the update process.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   And it is borderline exhaustive at this point.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:50.500]   There's just like Siri and touch ID and wife, like just so many things to set up that I think, you know, everyone is sort of how can they make this easier.
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:56.500]   But at the same time, there are things that are important that if you don't get them out in front of people, they would never discover or see or learn like activating.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.500]   Hey, sorry, hey, whatever s.i.r. i on its own is not really discoverable.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.500]   Neither is touch ID.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.500]   So you try to get that in front of people, but it becomes a longer and longer and longer and longer process.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   But I think Apple decided that with all the hacks and the different account information that had been leaked out that is important to have two factors.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:20.500]   So now as part of the setup buddy process, if you are not already using two factor, it will prompt you to set it up.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.500]   You can choose not to, but it's going to ask you to do it.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.500]   Choose it.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.500]   Choose it.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.500]   I also know that there it's not specific features that was getting me.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   I downloaded on my iPad.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.500]   I guess, afternoon, I was really using it a lot last night.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   It seemed a little bit faster and I was about to over geek and so I wonder if they use the new blah, blah, blah, tak, tak, tak, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:50.500]   But an Apple engineer tweeted about how they in 10.3, they decided to tweak the animations a little bit to make some of them a little bit shorter to optimize here and there.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:59.500]   So it's not that the whole thing is running faster, it's that instead of giving you the, here's the wonderful camera move that will take you from the button you just pushed to the dialogue.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   It's going to, what if we just like made that happen a lot faster?
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   So it does seem a lot faster.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.500]   You also get the new file system.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   So HFS plus is done.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.500]   And I want to see, I wish that I, unfortunately, I'm so excited about the new update.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.500]   I didn't screenshot to find out how much storage space I had on the device.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:23.500]   It seems like I've got more storage space than I did before, but that could just be something that pre downloaded in the background.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:32.500]   But it should be, it should be faster because this new file system is optimized for the kind of storage that iPads and iOS devices use.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.500]   It should be more secure.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.500]   The security is baked into a deeper level.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   So we should see some under the under the hood sort of things that improved performance already.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   I haven't seen any reason not to download it yet.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.500]   It seems to be nothing but upside.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:55.500]   And especially, I hate to say not to download it because it includes the security updates, doesn't it as well?
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.500]   So I never want to tell someone not to update.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   Update.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.500]   Yeah, there's only, if you are on a 32 bit iPhone, you will not get the update.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.500]   Apple pulled it because there were some issues with the update, but it should be fixed.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.500]   I think it's like five and five.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.500]   Five and five C.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.500]   Which is still on HFS.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.500]   That's the big deal.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.500]   We sort of totally buried the lead there.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.500]   HFS, sorry, Apple file system, AF, AF, yes.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.500]   APFS is now been deployed.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.500]   This is actually amazing because Apple replaced the file system on hundreds of millions of devices.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.500]   Pretty much without a hitch.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.500]   Like I didn't see any widespread panic or lost data.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:36.500]   And for anyone who worked in like any of the previous file system transitions, those were ugly ugly ugly messes.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.500]   And yeah, iPhones are incredibly controlled constrained environments.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:45.500]   But I still think it's near a technological miracle that you can just swap and replace a file system like that.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.500]   So who does?
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:54.500]   Well, yeah, but realize that nobody has any understanding, any appreciation that there are files of any kind inside your phone.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.500]   That's how blocked down the thing is.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.500]   But yes, it is.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.500]   It is a huge transition they made.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.500]   So the fact that things that didn't start crashing left, right, top and bottom is a big deal.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.500]   So there's there's people got space back gigs and gigs of space back, which is amazing.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.500]   I didn't expect that.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:12.500]   So I don't think that's why I'd like to figure I wish that I'd been more careful before I do the update.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:18.500]   It's possible that it's optimizing storage better or it's possible this just saying, hey, we no longer need a lot of these library and dictionary files.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.500]   So we can just this is all trash.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.500]   We can suddenly suddenly heave out.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   But one last one last thing about when we're talking about not upgrading the usually you don't have to worry about it because Apple updates are usually very, very stable.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:36.500]   However, if you have a really old device, like if you've got a phone that's three generations old, if you've got a Mac, that's three or five.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:45.500]   You might want to hold off just to make sure that the new whatever it is supports your old hardware, particularly if you've got an older iPhone.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:54.500]   If you're very if you're happy with your iPhone 4s or your iPhone 5, it's possible that there'll be a new version of iTunes that no longer can sink your old device.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:04.500]   And well, what if I do this through the cloud and oh, well, your your version, the last version of iOS that is available for your machine does not support the cloud syncing service.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:10.500]   And now you're sort of in a bind where you now have to buy a new phone just to be able to update the whole thing.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.500]   So that's why if you're having older machine, if it works great for you, that's great.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.500]   Don't don't worry about upgrading it.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:29.500]   But before you download stuff automatically, it's possible that you won't get the new operating system because it's not available for it, but you will be able to download the new iTunes because it'll run on the old operating system, but it won't run on older phones.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.500]   So something to Google for before you click that button.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:40.500]   The other new thing in 10.3 is sort of the shaming developers who haven't updated their apps in a long time.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:47.500]   There's the you can see what apps will in the future not work well with your iPhone.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   What do you guys think about that?
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   Every bank in the world is now rehiring the original iOS for development team that made their app and it's not changed since then.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.500]   Thank goodness.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.500]   So yeah, I think that's it.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:03.500]   It's 32 bit apps. If you haven't updated your app for 64 bit, which came out in 2012 with the iPhone 5s, you'll get a warning.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.500]   Okay. Yeah. And you can see a list of them.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.500]   I think it's in general settings general.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:15.500]   Is there is there a date when they're going to stop supporting it? Is it like the next aisle iOS 11?
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.500]   I don't think they've confirmed that.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.500]   Right.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.500]   All right.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:26.500]   Well, it'll be interesting to see how how it'll be interesting to see how many apps, you know, get culled in that process, you know, because it's going to be one of those things where we may see.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:34.500]   You know, tens or even hundreds of thousands of apps, you know, that just weren't very successful, that no one's really bothered with suddenly disappear.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.500]   Yeah, I only have one in my list list.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.500]   It's yeah, settings general about applications.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.500]   I've kind of dug it in there, but you can probably search for app compatibility to find it.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:55.500]   So we were talking a second ago about not you were talking about it, Andy, about not being able to dig into your iPhone, not being able to get access or do things that you might want to do.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   And of course, Apple recently bought workflow and I want to talk about that and your thoughts on what that means and whether you use it.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.500]   But first I want to thank our sponsor for this show, Audible.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.500]   Audible, I've been using Audible for I think about 14 years now.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.500]   I have a pretty big library.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.500]   When I look through it, it gives a good range of all the books that I've been listening to.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.500]   So it goes through all the books that my kids have been listening to when they were young.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   Now they're teenagers and so they still love to listen to Audible.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.500]   Audible is a great service.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:34.500]   Audio books that you can listen to on your iPad or your iPhone or your computer.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:42.500]   They're the leading provider of audio books across all types of literature, including fiction, nonfiction and periodicals.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.500]   I usually read fiction and I listen to nonfiction.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.500]   I've listened to some great books over the years on Audible.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   For listeners of Macbreak Weekly, Audible is offering you a free audiobook to give you a chance to try out their service.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:01.500]   One audiobook that you might enjoy, that I am enjoying, it's called The Undoing Project.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   It's about Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman and it's social economics.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.500]   It really is a great book to listen to.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   I have to rewind a lot and listen to stuff again.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   It's that good.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   To download this audiobook for free or another one of your choice with a free 30-day trial, all you have to do is go to the end of the video.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   That's audible.com/macbreak.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.500]   Do not forget to add the Macbreak at the end of it because that's that way.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   They will know that we sent you to them.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.500]   All right.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.500]   Well, now let's talk about workflow.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   Do any of you regularly use workflow?
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.500]   Is workflow part of your workflow?
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.500]   I use it a little bit.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.500]   I am no sooner to call dwell or Federico Vitticci.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.500]   I just use it for a few things that are exactly what it's meant for.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.500]   It's tasks that you do over and over again.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:54.500]   It's basically, if you're not familiar with it, it's like Automator for iOS.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:59.500]   Given what Andy mentioned before about how Lockdown iOS is, it's a miracle that this app exists.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.500]   They are so clever.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:09.500]   They're the kind of guys that at WWDC, the day after Apple makes their announcements, they've hacked everything to do far more than anyone, including Apple ever thought was possible with the new APIs.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.500]   I cannot stress how smart this team is.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   I think this is whether Apple decides to leave workflow itself long term in the App Store because they let Siri go for like a year and then killed it, or they just put them to work on Siri Kit or on an automation kit that's iOS and an OS 10 cross platform.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   This is just a stupendously smart hire on Apple's part.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:36.500]   Yeah, I mean, double so because they're really trying to attach the iPad's future to enterprise.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:43.500]   They don't have a way to sell the people who need to buy like 100 Apple computers to issue to their workforces.
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.500]   They don't have a computer that really fits that role unless you call that the iPad.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:52.500]   And so this is why you're seeing so many of these ads saying, Hey, get an iPad.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   It's just it's just as good as a laptop.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.500]   And here's what you can hear.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.500]   How you can run office on it.
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.500]   Here's like new all these other things on it.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:05.500]   That's why they're spending so much money on ads and buying workflow is a big, big, big step forward for all that just solves so many problems.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   Because one of the problems that you have in enterprises that essentially you've got a whole in house computer company, so to speak,
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.500]   that is building computers and building software just for the needs of that company.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:22.500]   If you have a super lockdown system like iOS, you just can't make it work that way.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:34.500]   However, however this choir lets lets these IT departments develop a workflow so that when it comes time to get a bid together or when it comes time to you're out in the field
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.500]   and you've got you've collected all these reports into into a document.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.500]   Now here's how you can get this distributed to eight different places at the same time.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   You need to train the all these employees, all these executives, all these managers who aren't really fascinated by workflows and process.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.500]   They just want to be trained.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.500]   Here is the button I push to make the thing that needs to go go.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.500]   So that's a very, very, very smart, smart play.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   Are you a workflow Alex?
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   I played with it a little bit.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.500]   Made my lights go due to different things based on web information.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.500]   I was like, "Oh, this is great.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   I'm going to do this everywhere."
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.500]   And then I didn't do any of it.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   So I haven't done much of it.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   I do think that the automation in general I think is pretty exciting.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.500]   I've seen some pretty interesting workflows.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:27.500]   But I'm definitely going to be, I've played with a bunch of different automation tools and they're all great and I wish I had more time to noodle with them.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.500]   That's four hours more in a day. That's what I would like.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.500]   That's all we need.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   Go to maxdories.net.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.500]   They have an incredible workflow archive.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.500]   And if you subscribe to their newsletter, you get even more advanced stuff.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   Just hand deliver to your inbox.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   It's really, really terrific.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.500]   That's great.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   And it really does scratch the service at what's possible.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.500]   I don't know if you've ever seen the Omni group has a website.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.500]   I think it's an official, I don't know if it's an official website.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.500]   But if you go to omni-automation.com, it shows off.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   They've got this thing called Omni.js, which is sort of a flavor of JavaScript they're doing that lets you automatize.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.500]   Automate processes between Omni apps.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   And the way that it functions, it doesn't look so much like they've created super hardwired pipelines between their apps.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:14.500]   It looks like you're just writing JavaScript and controlling apps.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:21.500]   So you just like to think that there's a lot more that could be done with true automation on the iPad.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.500]   Because I'm going to New York tonight.
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   And I really am struggling between the issue of do I want to take the MacBook or do I want to take the iPad?
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.500]   Because the iPad is just going to be better for the tasks I'm going to be doing.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   It's going to be a lot more fun.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:41.500]   There's just this one app, actually this week's a pick of the week, that I really want to keep playing with on my train ride down that was only available on the Mac.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:47.500]   So it really is a super professional sort of computer to run on.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:57.500]   But the sooner we can get real automation things like workflows, like OmniJS, the more things you'll be able to do.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:02.500]   Again, it's one of two things that make me want to take the MacBook for these two days in New York.
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:08.500]   It'd be great if there were only maybe one thing or even zero things that I would need the MacBook for.
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:15.500]   All right, let's talk about the rumor, the AR goggles rumor that won't die.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:22.500]   Apple has been developing AR goggles for a year, says 95 Mac or says financial times.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.500]   Or is this a follow up to the financial times?
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:30.500]   What do you think do you, what do you think Apple's AR goggles strategy is?
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:35.500]   I definitely think that AR is going to be a big deal.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.500]   I mean, I think that, you know, it'll be interesting to see what Apple has done with it.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.500]   I think that they know they've said a year or more.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:46.500]   I think Apple's been working on AR for probably quite some time if they're anywhere near the surface.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.500]   I think that we've been playing around a lot.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.500]   It's got us thinking about AR and we've been doing a bunch of internal development and playing around with ideas around AR.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:01.500]   And I think that there are a couple key things to solve within AR, tracking being one of the big things,
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.500]   tracking and really knowing exactly where you are inside of a space.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:10.500]   But I think that if you get some of that working, the opportunities are pretty outstanding as far as
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:15.500]   education, corporate, military government, those types of things.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.500]   There's a lot of things that you could use it for.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:24.500]   Yeah, I mean, we've talked about it before, but Apple has so much money and they've just built prototype after prototyping machine.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.500]   They can actually go through, if we can talk about it on a podcast or on a blog post,
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.500]   they actually have the resources to explore it, if it makes sense to start prototyping it,
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.500]   and then see if it wants to go to market.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.500]   And sometimes the answer is no, like with the Apple television and sometimes it's yes, like with Apple Watch.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.500]   So if there's any product that's at all popular or any sort of technology that's at all trendy,
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.500]   Apple has incredible amount of resources to bring to bear and to see whether an Apple version makes sense,
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.500]   which is why the special projects group does cars and special projects group does VR and the best of all,
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:55.500]   does group does AR and as a bunch of other things, it's to explore and find out which of these should go to market.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:00.500]   And then you make a thousand and you say no to all of them and you make one that makes a lot of sense and that goes.
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.500]   So I think AR, Tim Cook's comments previously are that AR is going to be part of almost everything,
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   the way that LCD or OLED is part of display is now, they'll just be an alternate reality, sorry, an augmented reality aspect
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.500]   to a lot of the things that Apple does, whether they make, you know,
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:20.500]   snapicles or something similar to that, that'll just depend on whether that makes sense as a product.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:28.500]   I don't know if we'll see Apple, for example, if we'll see someone have an iPhone and just strap it to their eyes,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.500]   you know, like walk around like a gear VR or something,
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.500]   because that might not be the sort of social interaction experience that Apple wants,
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.500]   but there'll be all sorts of ways to, Tim Cook has talked about Pokemon Go before
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:45.500]   and there's probably some sort of unobtrusive technology, like snap-ons or something, I don't know what form it'll take,
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.500]   but there's all sorts of possibilities here.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.500]   I just want one that has a heads-up display of everybody's name.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:42:00.500]   So it's like, you know, that's Frank, that's Andy, you know, it's exactly like, you know, like, I just need that one to just kind of pop up.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.500]   Oh, Andy, 10 bucks, avert, avert, avert.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:09.500]   No, no, for me, even if it's only, even if it's only like a stoplight, just one LED that goes green,
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:15.500]   meaning that you know this person, you've had conversations with this person, this person might be greeting you by name,
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:20.500]   yellow, meaning that this is someone you see maybe a couple of times a year at conferences,
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:25.500]   they're not going to expect you to remember everything, then red, meaning that, oh, total stranger, don't worry about it, you can say,
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.500]   I'm sorry, I don't know what's your name, I'm Andy. That's all I want.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.500]   I wanted to remember all the things.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.500]   My suicide will be postponed by 18 years if I can have those glasses.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:40.500]   Yeah, I just, all the things I forget, like if my, you know, my audible book I'm reading or whatever it is,
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.500]   I wanted to just appear in front of me.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:51.500]   Yeah, but I do, I do think that we, it could help us make, make us better human beings by putting, you know, information about the person.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.500]   And it's not just, it's not just the goggles.
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:59.500]   I mean, like you look at AirPods and AirPods in the future could serve, like could say we detected, you know, Megan's iPhone, you know, Megan, that's Megan, she's got two kids,
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:07.500]   and it's just whispering this in your ear as you're walking up to have a conversation, and AirPods are so small and intrusive people can barely see them outside of your ears anymore.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:17.500]   We just have all these different auditory reality augmentation and visual reality augmentation, hopefully not too much, all factory augmentation, but the possibilities are fairly endless.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.500]   Hey, I'll be in New York, I'm getting as much all factory augmentation.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:22.500]   There you go.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.500]   Downtown San Francisco, roses, roses, I tell you.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.500]   So Renee, I noticed you have the red iPhone, it's lovely.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:35.500]   And do you have the, oh, you don't have a screen protector on it, so it still has the white face?
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:43.500]   I like, so I've been buying white iPhones since Apple introduced them, I think on the iPhone 3G and I love the rose gold and I bought the gold and I actually prefer white phones.
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:49.500]   So for those of us who like, this is a Canadian flag, I don't know how anyone would want it, there's no red and black Canadian flag, Megan.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.500]   100% honest here.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.500]   I really like that, I know some people really prefer black screens for a variety of reasons.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:03.500]   Some people wanted a red screen, but if you stare at a red screen a lot, it starts to affect the color balance in your own eyes, so you want to avoid having a high intensity color that you're looking at.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.500]   But all this goes away when Apple deletes the bezels anyway, so it's a really temporary problem.
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:16.500]   My big question about the red iPhone is why won't they say the exact percentage of money that's going to the global fund, why are they being not saying that?
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:33.500]   I think it's just one of those conversations where it varies by product and by region, so if you're in Canada and you're in the US and there's different laws and different charities and they just don't want to get into that conversation, they would just rather say we've donated $130 million to date and that's a really nice, simple round number that's easy to rattle off.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:45:02.500]   There was also some issues in China, they had removed the product red packaging from, totally from it, and there were some rumors that it was because the global fund donates money to HIV/AIDS and maybe that was going to not be accepted in China, but now there's a report from Mac Rumors or Tim Cook says that they are donating the money to the product red iPhone 7 that's being purchased in China.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.500]   So, yes, in case you were worried about that, at least they--
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:15.500]   It seems to be connected to branding via NGOs and so on and so forth, it's not just legalities within China for how you state that, but it's not changing what they're doing with it.
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.500]   It's not changing, and people--
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.500]   And red's usually popular color, it represents luck and fortune.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   Does this mean they're going to be doing different colors, do we think? Do we suspect that red is just the opening?
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:34.500]   Yeah, totally. When they didn't change very much about the design of the iPhone 5 series, the 5S got gold, and then the 6S got rose gold.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:41.500]   And the 7, because the 7 wasn't that much different, it got jet black. And we discussed this, we're so superficial to us, color is a feature.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:45.500]   You can do it, you can not change anything else, give us a new exclusive color.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:53.500]   People are all hunting shiny Pokemon right now, Megan, like we just want things that sound exclusive and are different, and we will go to major lengths to get them.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.500]   So the color strategy, I don't know if Apple appreciated it at first.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:04.500]   They started off just because Kim Kardashian was desperate for a gold iPhone, and they started thinking, maybe that's a good idea, we'll do Project Cardassian and see where it takes us.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:09.500]   And we bought that phone and rose, people complained, "Oh my God, how can they make a gold iPhone?"
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.500]   And then the minute they released it, it's like, "What, this is BS, why can't I get my gold iPhone?"
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:17.500]   And they say it was like, "I can't believe Apple's doing this, and then why can't I get one?"
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.500]   And this is the same thing, people are like, "I can't believe I was making a red one, and now we just see complaints that people can't get enough of them."
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.500]   Humans are amazing.
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:41.500]   Renee, I don't think I'm going beyond what my powers are by speaking for a great number of listeners, saying that if Apple decided to do it, to make anything because Kim Kardashian wanted one, this is when we start switching to like, you know, Radio Shack brand phones and Radio Shack brand.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:47.500]   I don't want anything from a computer that bought the company that made something that Kim Kardashian wanted.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.500]   It was codename Kardashian, sorry.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:57.500]   But it couldn't have been worse, it could have made it garish HTC gold, I mean, they didn't do that.
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.500]   They took tasteful champagne gold.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   Are either one of you going to get the red iPhone 7?
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.500]   Do you both, Alex and Andy, you both have iPhone 7?
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.500]   We do, I have one.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.500]   You both do.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.500]   I have one, I don't use it though.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   Do you use an Android phone?
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:26.500]   Yeah, but my daily carry is Android. I have an iPhone 7 for my hardware library that I use probably once or twice a day for other things. But yeah, I have an iPhone 7.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:34.500]   And I was just picture Andy, like on a library with a ladder that he has to pull the ladder across, go up and start selecting phones off the shelves.
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:40.500]   Actually, I was like, "I was picturing that heads up display that was like Android phone, Android phone, Android phone."
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.500]   Oh, yeah, like the Matrix, all the phones just fly past him.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:51.500]   Or I can do something, you know, over to a shelf here, which is just some stuff that I've got.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:48:01.500]   You never know when you're going to have to, like, you know, but how does this compare to the keyboard on a radio shack, Model 100?
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.500]   You never know when you're hungry and you need a tablet sandwich.
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.500]   That's what I think you just said.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:15.500]   You know, the old cliche about like the nerd with a pocket protector that has 100 pens, even though he doesn't need them, this is my pocket protector with 100 pens in it.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:23.500]   A shelf with like every single device I have ever bought through the sands of time.
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:30.500]   I have to admit that I'm just reminded of my iPhone 7 every time I can't find my headphone jack.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:39.500]   I think I have five of the adapters. These little adapters, I have like five of them there in different jackets and pockets and things just to make sure that I don't.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.500]   And I still want to end up in a situation where I'm not ready.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.500]   I can't believe I bought this phone.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:50.500]   I'm just like, you know, like, every time I can't find it, I'm just like, I cannot believe it.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:55.500]   Or I can't charge my phone because I need to talk on it and I don't have like a little doubler or whatever.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:59.500]   And I'm just like, really, it's airplane. Because the airplane still wants a jack.
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:05.500]   What my phone doesn't have is I can't use AirPods on the airplane thing and I can't use 3.5 on my iPhone and the world's not compatible.
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:09.500]   Yeah, it's really hard life. It's really hard for us.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.500]   The worst.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.500]   It's the worst.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.500]   I know, I know exactly. It's the first world problem.
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:22.500]   All right, WWDC, anything, any news there? You guys excited about that? Anything that we can talk about on that front?
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.500]   Yeah, I'm just going to talk about it.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.500]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.500]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.500]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.500]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.500]   It's the first world problem that I think we can talk about.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.500]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.500]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.500]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.500]   It's the first world problem that I think we can talk about.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.500]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.500]   It's just hard. So many developers sell a little space.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.500]   All right.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.500]   Let's just stream it all.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.500]   Yep, they indeed.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.500]   Yes.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:05.500]   Oh, and this streaming, you would get WWDC maybe six months after everyone else if you didn't go there.
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:09.500]   They started off very slow and just streaming a few of the sessions from Presidio.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:14.500]   Now I think last year they streamed all the sessions and the videos were, I think every video was available later that day.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.500]   They were just people in hotels having streaming parties, watching the whole thing.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:22.500]   It was an amazing experience like night and day compared to where they were just a couple of years ago.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.500]   In a minute, I want to talk about charging.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.500]   I want to talk about the exciting world of charging.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.500]   I saw a patent that will let your iPhone and your iPad charge your laptop.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:38.500]   But first I want to take a second to thank our sponsor, Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.500]   If you've ever gotten a mortgage, you know it's frustrating.
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.500]   It's time consuming.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.500]   You're running all over the place.
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:50.500]   Basically you have to get dressed in real clothes, get off the couch and head out into the real world.
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.500]   But you don't have to do that anymore.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:57.500]   You can now do it from your couch with Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans.

[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.500]   When it comes to this big decision, it's a huge decision.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.500]   Houses are expensive, whether you're buying one or refinancing.
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.500]   It's important to work with someone who you trust.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:17.500]   And someone who has your best interest in mind, Rocket Mortgage has a transparent online process
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.500]   that gives you the confidence to make an informed decision.

[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:35.500]   So you can mess with all those levers online, sitting on your couch, eating popcorn or whatever.

[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:41.500]   That you feel comfortable with that you can trust.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:45.500]   So whether you're looking to buy a home or refinancing the existing mortgage that you already have,
[00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.500]   you can lift that burden of getting a home loan with Rocket Mortgage.
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.500]   We're all geeks.

[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:12.500]   Equal Housing Lender, licensed in all 50 states, and MLS, consumeraccess.org, number 30-30.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:17.500]   And we thank Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans for their support.
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:20.500]   So companies get patents, lots of patents.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:27.500]   There's one that we spotted that was charging your computer with your iPhone or iPad.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.500]   What do you guys think of this?
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.500]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:37.500]   We already have, on the other side of the fence, we already have a USB-C allowed to charge.
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:42.500]   When you plug in a device, excuse me, when you plug in a USB-C device, like on Android
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.500]   and other operating systems, it doesn't, just like you get the, sometimes you get the pop-up that says,
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.500]   "Do you want this to be like a photo device? Do you want this to be mass storage?
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.500]   Do you want to just charge it?" And now one of the options with USB-C is,
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.500]   "Do you want this to act as a battery charger for the device you're connecting it to?"
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:00.500]   Which is awesome because it's like having just, you've got water in two or three bottles.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.500]   Maybe you want it to pour it from one place to another.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:08.500]   And given that my MacBook, excuse me, given that my iPad Pro is just like a huge battery
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.500]   with a screen incidentally attached to it, oh boy, would I love to drain off 20% of that battery
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.500]   and put it into my phone when I'm nearly dead.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.500]   I read it as a little bit more ambitious than that.
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.500]   It seems to me like it wasn't just an electrical system, but it was almost like the old POM folio
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:28.500]   where they were making what amounts to a thin Mac client that you could slide an iOS device into
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.500]   and it sort of became a Mac that it would use a lot to the power of the chipsets,
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.500]   everything from the handheld device and just give you a big comfy keyboard and/or a big display
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:39.500]   if you're using an iPhone to sort of do all your work in.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.500]   I know a lot of companies have done this, like there have been Motorola and all sorts of versions of those
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.500]   and Windows TV and you have something like that.
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.500]   They had like a little like thing that you could do that was separate that you brought back together.
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.500]   And I figured that out.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.500]   Yeah, and the whole continuum thing is doing all that, but I don't know if Apple would do it better.
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:56.500]   They've always seemed a little bit, you know, not great in my experience so far.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:01.500]   And Apple might never bring this to market, but of course they're going to patent it if they're even beginning to look at it.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:05.500]   But I just like the idea because my iPhone is my everything and if I don't have to have multiple everything's,
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:09.500]   if I have one store of truth, one store of identity, one store of information,
[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:13.500]   and then just a handier way to type and browse on it, I mean that would be great for me.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.500]   Yeah, I mean we're talking about a really good iPad doc.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.500]   The drawings we're seeing right there, the thing that made that is more interesting to me than the idea of having
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:30.500]   my iPhone be expanded into something with a keyboard and a screen is the idea of repurposing this really good,
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:38.500]   super high definition, beautiful color accurate display, super cool multi touch sensor array on top of it.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:43.500]   And basically what if you were able to use that as the trackpad of your laptop?
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:50.500]   So not only do you have all this multi touch things going on, but you would also have the advantages of let's say the touch bar on the 2016 MacBooks
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:56.500]   where it's not just going to give you a surface to touch on, it will also be able to give you buttons that are context aware
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.500]   or a place for Siri to live for instance.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.500]   It's a great idea.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:09.500]   The more time I spent with the touch bar, the more I wish that you could essentially dock an iPad or an iOS device to the Mac
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.500]   and just use it as an input device that way.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:19.500]   So as we've all seen that Apple patents pretty much everything so you see a lot of interesting ideas that were worth
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:22.500]   the money to just file a patent for it.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.500]   I don't know if anything is going to come of it.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:31.500]   So there's I'm sure that there are three or four or five different attempts to make a dockable phone that we haven't even mentioned
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:37.500]   because it's one of these ideas that comes up just every two or three years somebody proposes to do this.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.500]   The Samsung Galaxy S8 is coming out tomorrow.
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:45.500]   One of the rumors is that it's going to be it's going to have a desktop dock so that when you dock it,
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:51.500]   you basically get this HDMI like HD desktop sort of display desktop version of Android.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.500]   People keep trying and trying and trying it.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.500]   Microsoft tried it with Windows 10.
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:00.500]   They just can't get anybody to be interested in actually using a phone that way.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:09.500]   So maybe it might be one of the things that like like it's like all those old timey all timey movies of people who've built these
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:15.500]   flappy, flappy wings jumping off of like cliffs and trying to fly because it just makes sense that this would work.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.500]   I know what the last person did wrong.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.500]   They made it out of bamboo.
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:22.500]   They should have made it out of Alden word.
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.500]   And that's the reason why they failed.
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:29.500]   And so cut to new film of someone flapping, flapping, flapping and then falling right onto the sand.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.500]   So it'll be fun to watch if they actually build it.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:47.500]   So Renee, I know that you had some hands on time with a very important app, the Clips app, which appears to be very similar to what's already out there in terms of video, aside from the ability to automatically caption.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.500]   What did you think about it?
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.500]   So I totally underestimated this app.
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:57:01.500]   I thought I'll admit I thought this was going to be like a dad joke like Apple looked at Snapchat or we can, you know, a 30 or 40 year old company trying to be young and hip and we can do something socially and networking.
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:06.500]   All the kids are Instagramming and snapping and we can get involved in that and it would thud like ping for me.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.500]   That was my expectation going in.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.500]   And I was actually really surprised.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.500]   It's not like the iMessage team.
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:17.500]   I would have thought that Apple would say this is iOS 11 iMessage and we've added all these special features and they're exclusive to iMessage.
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.500]   Your blue bubble friends get to enjoy them all.
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.500]   But they've made a standalone app and once they started talking about it, I really got it.
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:25.500]   It's done by the video team.
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.500]   It's not done by any social team.
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.500]   It's not done by any messaging team.
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   It's almost like when Randy Ublos announced iMovie several years ago, he said, "I was on vacation and I just wanted to share my vacation footage and I couldn't do it quickly and easily.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.500]   So I made this all new iMovie."
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.500]   And this is the same thing.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:45.500]   It's like now that generation of people, they're not on vacation trying to share some videotape footage that they took.
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   They're on social and they're taking things with their iPhones and iPads and they just want to quickly share a funny clip where they want to have the next viral video.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:58:03.500]   And it's just kind of laborious because you have memories and according to Apple, memories is super popular with a lot of people because the only feature those people want is automatic and a play button.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.500]   And this just takes your photos and gives you little collage videos out of them and they love that.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:11.500]   But when they want to start tweaking them, the next step is iMovie and that's just too big a step for them.
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:18.500]   So the video team made something that's like in between memories and iMovie and it's got this idea where all you do is you make clips.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.500]   You hold down the button and it's got really good affordance.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.500]   It actually says hold down this button to record.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:25.500]   You don't have to sort of discover it the way you discover Snapchat UI.
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.500]   You hold down that button and you record a clip.
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:41.500]   If you want to, you can dictate like you learned to E-Nun C8 at Juilliard and it'll start putting titles down for you and you can choose a variety of different title and styles from quick smash impact to floaty to careening.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.500]   Really cute.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:51.500]   Or you can just take some video and you can put really nice, really beautifully animated emoji on them or like bang poof pow Batman style effects on.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:58.500]   Or captions like I can say this is Andy and it'll animate in, it'll ease in, it'll ease out, it'll look really, really cool.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:03.500]   And then you take another clip and another clip and you can do selfies and you can do elses and you can do couplings and all sorts of things.
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:06.500]   And you can even take photos and you hold down to add the photo.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.500]   So if you want the photo up for a second, you hold and let go.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:13.500]   If you want to run for five seconds, you hold it down and you can like print and zoom while you're adding it.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.500]   It'll duplicate the movement you make.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:19.500]   So you can do like fake boomerang zoom by going in and out while you're doing things.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:23.500]   And then it'll, sorry I'm going on about this, but it's really, really clever.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.500]   And then you can move the little clips around.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.500]   Just grab one, drag it, drop it to a new place.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.500]   So if you put in where you are and not that'd be better at the beginning, you just move it around.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.500]   And then it'll identify it.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:41.500]   So if I have a picture of Andy and I say I wish Alex were here, it would immediately say do you want to share this with Alex and Andy because Andy is in your facial recognition photography library.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.500]   And you mentioned Alex and he's in your contacts.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:45.500]   So we'll let you share with them.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:50.500]   Or you can save it out and for apps that have a right API, you can actually send it straight to them.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   And then you can use this sort of the front end.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:57.500]   And I know like on iMore, we've been struggling with tools to make really cute Instagram and Facebook videos.
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.500]   And those videos are silent by default and you want the titles in there.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:06.500]   It's just become something you have to do because people just don't want loud music blurring out at them immediately.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.500]   And this might be a really good way for us to do that.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:14.500]   But I think it'll be just a lot of fun and there's live filters like comic book and I could go on about this for minutes.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.500]   But it was way more and way better than I expected it to be.
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.500]   And I think a lot of credit goes to the video team in Apple for that.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.500]   Yeah, it's really easy for me to be cynical about an app like this.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:28.500]   But I'm glad that Apple is still the third company that says, well, this is not something that will make us money.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500]   It probably won't even help us help us sell phones.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.500]   But it's a cool idea.
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.500]   This person wants to do this.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.500]   This person wants to do this team wants to do it.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.500]   Let's let them do it.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500]   And then let's and then saying, wow, that really is cool.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.500]   I'm using it all the time.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   Let's put our let's put our logo on this and make an official software.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:48.500]   It's like music memos, but for people who are doing video stuff instead of doing quick, it's like doing quick video sketches instead of quick music sketches.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   Well, I was going to bring up music memos because this is that was a big, there was a big splash about that.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.500]   But then we don't hear about it that often.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   And I thought I am not a musician, but I thought it would be something that people would use on a regular everyday basis.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500]   I said that.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.500]   And then like one of the people on our team said, I use it every day.
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.500]   I'm in a band.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.500]   We use it continuously.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.500]   And then people were like, wait, musicians are using it all the time.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.500]   Taylor Swift is all over that.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.500]   So apparently it's just us non music people that don't hear about it.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.500]   There's this whole discussion going on outside of us.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.500]   I haven't actually downloaded it yet, but I've, what I've seen of it.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:30.500]   It really does look like the sort of, I love tools that sort of inspire you to do things that are out of your wheelhouse only because it's difficult to do it in Final Cut.
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500]   It's even difficult to do it in iMovie.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:38.500]   But this is something that while you're while you're waiting for the shuttle to take you from your hotel back to the airport,
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:41.500]   you can screw around and buy the, you just did it to kill some time.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:50.500]   But by the time you're actually at the terminal, oh my God, I've actually made a really cool minute and a half clip that I didn't have anything to share about my vacation to my friends.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.500]   Now I do.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.500]   That's, that seems like that's the sort of app this is.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500]   And we should say it's not available yet.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500]   It's not available until April.
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.500]   April.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.500]   You, Renee, got a hands on skin.
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.500]   But your Insta is going to be lit, Megan.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.500]   Your Insta is going to be lit.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.500]   As the kids say.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.500]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.500]   Speaking of the kids, Emoji, there are lots more new emoji.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.500]   And Tanya here is very excited about the milkshake emoji.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500]   She demanded it.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500]   I guess it's a cup of the straw.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:24.500]   But there are 69 new emoji coming with Unicode this summer.
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:28.500]   There's looks like some meditating.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500]   A porcupine.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.500]   A brain.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:36.500]   A brain.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.500]   Is that a person with a spoon?
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.500]   What's, I don't know.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.500]   I scream scoop because I don't know.
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.500]   They don't look like they have clothes on.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.500]   I mean, I'm just saying.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.500]   A real question is how hard is it to hold down french fries and get poutine tater tots and,
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.500]   I don't know, hash browns.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500]   How hard would that be for Unicode or Apple to implement?
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.500]   It's an, it's, okay, Renee.
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.500]   It's 2017.
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.500]   It's an open standard.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500]   You can write a proposal for inclusion.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.500]   But apparently you like just to mouth off and talk a big game.
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:05.500]   You still want to affect social change and put some skin in the game.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.500]   Potato skins.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.500]   You can have nothing to say about that.
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   I have hit the nail.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.500]   I've just hit it right on the head there.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.500]   You've been working on that for a while, right?
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.500]   Renee, Renee, we're waiting.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:20.500]   We're, we're, so next, by next Mac break, we're expecting to see some, some quality artworks.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.500]   I'm putting the hell out of emoji.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.500]   It just, there you go.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.500]   There you go.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.500]   I don't think it's hard.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.500]   There you go.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.500]   It's not hard to make a poutine emoji.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.500]   But poutine is disgusting, and that's why they haven't done it.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   What?
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.500]   No, no, nothing.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.500]   Nothing.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.500]   Nothing.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.500]   Poutine guardian can possibly be disgusting.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   I will defend any cheesy-based snack.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500]   You wound me, ma'am.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   Renee's furiously typing to Leo.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.500]   Do not let Megan host Mac break again ever.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.500]   She is an anti-poutine night.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.500]   I feel like I'm stuck in Seinfeld right now.
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   Starting to feel like a regime change.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.500]   I'm not comfortable with cheating.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.500]   I'm not comfortable with cheating.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.500]   It's only kale emoji.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:00.500]   It's fine.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.500]   Poutine.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.500]   Is there a kale emoji?
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.500]   I didn't look at it.
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:08.060]   We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't need to argue that what really happens is that there'll
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:12.540]   be the new emoji and then the world will come together and decide what sex thing this will
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:15.500]   actually start to represent in our conversations.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.500]   Yes.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.500]   Thank you.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:22.940]   Well, that was, I mean, that was what I was wondering about the person with the spoon.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.500]   I'm not sure what's going on there.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.500]   Maybe we should go ahead.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.500]   Exactly.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:34.620]   You're at a meeting and you suddenly get a text from your boyfriend, your girlfriend with
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.060]   that and suddenly, okay, this meeting is adjourned.
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.060]   I'm going home.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.060]   It's like a steam room, right?
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.500]   They're not just steamed, they're not just naked with spoons.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.500]   It's steeping.
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.500]   Oh my goodness.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.500]   Let's get a big bowl of pudding and eat it naked.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.500]   Okay.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.340]   And is there a second horns emoji?
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.500]   Was the first horns emoji not good enough?
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.500]   Like horns?
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.500]   Like, yeah.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.500]   There's like someone throwing the horn.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.500]   No, someone throwing the horns in the goat.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.500]   Throw the goat.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.500]   Or is that the idea?
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.500]   I love you, son.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.500]   The other one was the horns.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.500]   This is the, I love you, son, I guess.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.660]   This is, this is peace.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:05.860]   This is throwing the goat.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.860]   This is when there's too much rock and roll for just one hand.
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:09.860]   Okay.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:14.180]   Well, if you have such strong feelings, you should talk to my friend Jeremy, who's on
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:18.940]   the, you know, the board of the emoji, Pedia and meets every week and all of it.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.740]   Like complaint, Eric, I complained to Jeremy.
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.340]   Oh, you already spoke to Jeremy.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.340]   Okay.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:31.340]   I have to imagine that's about 17/18 of your job on that board.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:35.340]   So just to say, oh, yeah.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.340]   That's a horrible, yes.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:38.340]   Sweet potato.
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.340]   No.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.660]   I think, I think that was one of the things that I really loved about Telegram was the,
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:47.820]   was all of the photos that you could, you know, I have like thousands of photos in my,
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.180]   in my telegram account, but I don't really use much because I couldn't get anyone else
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.180]   to use it.
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:55.260]   But, but it was great to have these great big photos that you could throw in there.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:59.620]   I guess it was a little annoying because they were big, but, but it was, it was a good time.
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.180]   You know, I think I've gotten very addicted to emojis and, and gifts.
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:07.380]   Well, Baba in the chat room says that's not a spoon.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.380]   It's a shower.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.380]   So.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.380]   Oh, what?
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:11.380]   A shower.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:12.380]   I mean, it's a, okay.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.380]   Oh, that's not, I don't have that.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.380]   The sun.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.380]   It doesn't look like a shower.
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.380]   That's a sauna.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:21.780]   A scoop you use for the.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:22.780]   A scoop?
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   A sauna.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.780]   Okay.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780]   Carson says it's the.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.780]   Oh, it's a sauna.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.780]   It's like the little that you put it.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.780]   You put it on the rocks.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.780]   Okay.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.940]   I would, I would, but if you, if you have a metal one of those, I think you would burn
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:32.940]   your hand.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:38.180]   I'd not, I'm saying that I, I'm saying that that's a bad interface design, I think.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:43.580]   I would much rather say eating, putting in a hot tub naked because you're so excited
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.980]   about putting that you're probably going to get it all over yourself anyway.
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:48.580]   So you may as well hold on eating, putting.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:49.580]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:50.580]   I like that.
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:53.780]   I'm, I'm, I'm thinking it's the Netflix and chill of 2018.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.180]   And now we have a title.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.180]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.980]   Eating, putting it on top is really going to be a great title.
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:00.980]   Leo is going to be sorry.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:03.780]   He went on vacation with green heels.
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:04.780]   Is that the other one?
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.180]   I just, I may, I need you to explain these to me.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.380]   I, I, mega, you're, you've got nail on the head.
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.860]   Leo is going to be back from vacation tomorrow because he's like, Oh my God, it's running
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.380]   way too well without me.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:19.780]   I need to come back before they, you know, before there's no job for me to come back to.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:20.780]   Right.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.180]   Things happen when, when Megan hosts.
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:23.180]   Mm hmm.
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.180]   Yep.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.580]   So I have strong feelings about emoji.
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:32.340]   I also have strong feelings about Ikea and they just announced a new set of Internet of
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.340]   Holmes devices.
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.780]   I don't, I'm not sure if they work with home kit.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:36.780]   I think they work with Zigbee.
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.380]   I don't know if you guys have checked this out.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.380]   It was an article in the Verge yesterday.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:41.780]   I just moved into a new house.
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:47.180]   So I am seriously thinking about all the home automation that I can do.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:51.960]   Are you guys Ikea fans and do you think that I, I just think that I, I have a lot of a
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:56.620]   key of furniture and what I'm expecting from this is my expectation related to these is
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:00.260]   that I'm going to have instructions that are in black and white and not printed very well.
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:04.340]   And, and when I'm finished with it, I'm going to have a couple of pieces still left over
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:08.740]   and not sure exactly why that, why that light doesn't really actually turn away.
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:12.420]   They over pack the pieces.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.740]   You go the Ikea store for a new LED bulb.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.420]   You come back with the LED bulb and three armwars.
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:18.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:20.820]   Well, yeah, that's the thing.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:23.860]   It's like, what are the two most confusing things to me right now?
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:28.740]   Putting together Internet connected home and putting together Ikea furniture.
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:32.820]   And so let's mix them together and yeah, Internet connected Ikea.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.460]   Oh, wait till you see the Ikea Lego set.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:36.460]   It's magnificent.
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:40.300]   Well, Scooter X in the chat room says that they're not for the US.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.980]   So maybe they're for Canada.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.980]   I don't know.
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.980]   That's, that's what he says.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:44.980]   Select your country's.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:47.260]   Yes, we don't get what you don't get.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.260]   We don't get what you get either.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.260]   I mean, we're very consistent.
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:54.900]   I don't know that that's a, that's possibly a chilling thought that if they're saying
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:09:00.300]   that we're selling an electrical device, we think it's safe, but just in case we're not
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.900]   selling it to any country that does not have nationalized healthcare.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:08.900]   We think it's going to be okay.
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.900]   It's fine.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:14.620]   When it's been tested, was been tested on Canadians, then we'll let it be sold.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:17.460]   Stephen Penny is saying it's a Tivana emoji.
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.700]   It comes from a Finland, Finland tourist bought board campaign a little while ago.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.580]   But I think that's not world readable.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:27.860]   I think it's a little bit opaque outside of that one Finland tourist campaign is what
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:28.860]   I'm going to say.
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.860]   All right.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.260]   All right, should we dare to talk about politics?
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:39.140]   Is that something that the only political story that I have seen is the Office of American
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.500]   Innovation, which seems like a great idea to me.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:48.900]   I was announced yesterday run by Jared Kushner and Tim Cook is going to be an advisor in
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.660]   the Office of American.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.660]   Happy Helix.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.660]   He's so happy.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:55.060]   He's like sticking it.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:56.060]   He's leaning in.
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.060]   Sheryl Sandberg would be happy.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.060]   He's leaning in on that table.
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.060]   He's leaning in some direction.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.180]   Look, he looks a little bit like he's photoshopped there.
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:05.180]   Doesn't he?
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.780]   Like he looks a little smaller than everyone else.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.980]   I'm not thinking too much.
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:12.540]   You could probably cut that photo out and use it in a lot of places like this is what
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.540]   I would say.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.540]   So what do we think?
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.540]   And then dip was looking here.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.540]   I have always.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:17.540]   I think it makes sense.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.060]   I think it makes sense for Apple to be part of it.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.180]   I mean, I think that you want to be part of those conversations.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:25.340]   Whether you necessarily agree with what they're doing or how they're doing it.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.020]   I think being heard I think is important.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020]   So I think he's on it.
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.420]   I think Elon Musk as well.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:31.900]   And there's one other.
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:32.900]   Bill Gates.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.900]   Yeah, Bill Gates.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:38.700]   So I think I'm just going to try to have some kind of input and make sense.
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:39.700]   I'm just joking.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.300]   Like it always feels like with government they create a committee to study the plausibility
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:47.460]   of getting a committee to discuss the philosophy of making a potential recommendation to somebody.
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.980]   And then they spend lots of money and take up lots of time.
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:52.700]   And we at the end result of this see nothing.
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.700]   So hopefully this is not that.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.860]   I'm optimistic for a couple of reasons.
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.820]   Number one, it does not have the word freedom or liberty in the title.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:03.100]   So that's a good indication.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:06.700]   But also I can be I'll be a little optimistic.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:11.780]   I'll stick my neck out because this comes on the heels of the announcement that a fellow
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:17.900]   fellow named Matt Leera has become an official tech advisor to the White House who's a really
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.900]   interesting guy.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.540]   He's definitely a Republican.
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:25.660]   He's worked mostly for he's been he's worked for the as tech advisor for the Republican
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:29.100]   majority leaders twice I think the last two of them.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:34.020]   But he was noted throughout the Obama term Obama administration for someone who really
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:40.380]   is just interested in moving tech forward and basically being creating open government
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:44.820]   based on technology and basically bringing different groups together.
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.020]   It doesn't matter who came up with this idea.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.740]   It doesn't matter who's going to sign this is a good idea.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.140]   Let's make this happen.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:56.500]   So for instance there's a there's a under the he's he's also not afraid to even after the
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:02.340]   election to talk about what a great tech president Obama was and praised a lot of a lot of his
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.340]   policies.
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:09.780]   For instance he was one of the people who was trying to get trying to lock down a program
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:15.300]   that was started kind of informally sort of like a peace corps for tech people where tech
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:20.500]   executive can take a sabbatical to essentially work in government to lend some help on a
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:23.860]   project like when health care dot gov became a huge problem.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:27.780]   They say okay let's get let's get basically get a tiger team in here to just rebuild the
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.540]   website and make sure everything works properly.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:34.780]   Part of it was contractors the part was just look we got experts who are not going to leave
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:40.140]   these amazing amazing careers and amazing salaries to work for the government to fix
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.340]   the health care site.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:45.740]   But they're willing to take it to two or three months off to make to build something that
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.780]   taxpayers and citizens will benefit from.
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:51.260]   And so they decided to sort of make this into an official program.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:55.020]   It was the last piece of legislation that Obama signed to basically make this into an
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:59.300]   officially recognized project and he was one of the people that was sort of there's a
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:04.620]   wired article in a couple other places that talked about how it was literally his Obama's
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:09.660]   authority to sign legislation was going to end within the hour.
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:13.300]   But they found the room that he was waiting in during the inauguration.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.860]   They got the it was passed passed by the house passed by the Senate.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.580]   All they had to do was find out where Obama was and get this piece of led just get this
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.100]   piece of paper to him so he could sign it.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:27.700]   And he was one of the people that was like at backyard cookouts at trampoline parks trying
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:28.700]   to code code.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.180]   Where is he's maybe got to call this guy call this guy.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:35.620]   So anyway if this is the sort of thinking that comes from the extension of what was
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:40.420]   happening under the Obama plan which is let's have better communication between tech people
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.980]   and the government.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:43.060]   I'm all for it.
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:48.980]   I certainly don't think that the people that have been lined up for this task force
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:53.860]   are the sort of people that can be exploited by the White House to say yes well yes we're
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:57.140]   taking away people's rights and basically we're saying that we're gonna outlaw encryption
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:01.060]   and we're gonna make it out outlaw for you to copy an mp3 anywhere but look here's a
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:02.500]   picture of me with Tim Cook.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.740]   So obviously I know all about the computer stuff.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:09.620]   I'm really involved in things that are you know high tech.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:13.620]   I don't think that's that sort of thing so I can be optimistic about it.
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.580]   I'm optimistic too.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:19.900]   I think I would love to see a presidential race between Bill Gates and Tim Cook.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.900]   It would be fascinating.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.700]   I know it'll never happen.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:28.700]   It'll be the first election with a 110, 130% turnout.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:33.860]   The 5.8 billion votes Bill Gates with 17.8 trillion votes.
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:34.860]   This is Tim.
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:38.260]   I don't want to talk about future policies so I just think you'll be surprised and delighted
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.260]   if you vote for me.
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:41.060]   Oh my god.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:46.900]   I just got I just got a chill because if there's one phrase I associate with both Trump and
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:54.980]   Tim Cook it's like don't we've got and we've got great things in store for the Mac.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:55.980]   Incredible things.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.980]   Awesome things.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:01.260]   I'm incredibly excited the best Macs ever like okay but when we're going to see it the
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:06.900]   best we've got the best people working on the greatest Macs like oh no he's talking maybe
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:11.500]   he's it's rubbing off I don't know whether it's rubbing off one way or another but health
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:15.420]   care and Macs two things we're being promised that we're going to get but I have to wonder
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:20.900]   I should just find a place a nice cardboard box curl up and so they'll be I'll die some
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.060]   place safe right north and he just drive him.
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:26.580]   Yeah you'll get your new Mac when you get your wall.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.580]   Perhaps.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.900]   We'll get across the border.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:35.620]   Yeah maybe the wall will be made of the Macs that that you just just a spike me just a
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:42.180]   spike Mac people all the other people we built 18.1 billion wonderful we actually revive the
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:46.260]   the cheese grater Mac and you know what and we took all of them and they got the the latest
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:50.540]   Intel processors and now we're just using them as as building blocks to make a wall out of
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.740]   because that's how much we like you are Mac book.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:54.740]   It is personal.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:16:01.220]   I'm still a squirrel in the chat room asks if Mexico is going to pay for his Mac and yes
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.220]   it is.
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:09.980]   So I guess we next up is some picks so I have a pick I am hoping that you guys have some
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:14.420]   good picks because I need some recommendations but first I want to take a second a minute
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:20.380]   maybe even to thank our sponsor Betterment you want to invest in your future on your families
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.020]   future and like many of the things we talk about on the show you want to do it online

[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.060]   It's great technology.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.060]   This is really interesting.
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:45.940]   Betterment is the largest independent automated investing service and it's totally changed the
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:51.820]   industry by making investing easier and you pay a fraction of what you would pay for
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.980]   traditional financial services.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:59.060]   So Betterment what they do is they combine all the smart technology with human advisors
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:02.660]   to achieve optimal results at every level of investment.
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:08.900]   So you do get to talk to a human as well and you get to combine that with the technology.

[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:16.500]   who will monitor accounts and they're able to answer questions.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:20.660]   So occasionally you're going to have questions I do and I'm investing a lot of it doesn't
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:23.580]   make sense to me and I have some questions.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:27.340]   Customers also receive planning calls and notifications throughout the year.
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:31.380]   Betterment's goal based investing framework and advice algorithm will let you know if

[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:39.940]   tax returns.

[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.260]   So the fees is where that's where they get you and if you ever go looking through your
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:06.820]   statements or investment statements and there's so many fees and they don't make any sense.

[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.300]   Okay.
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.300]   I want to start with you, Alex.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.300]   Okay, fine.
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.300]   Be that way.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:31.140]   So throw me in the most.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:38.260]   So both my kids now, I'm getting to that part of parenting where both my kids are in Little
[01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.300]   League, my son and my daughter in Little League.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:46.100]   It's very complicated to keep track of who's going where and where's the practices, what
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.020]   games and what field and all those other things.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.020]   It used to be quite a thing.
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:55.780]   I mean, when I was a kid and we had a bunch of brothers and sisters and we were all playing.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:20:01.120]   I hadn't seen it before until last week, but my kids, I downloaded this app called
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:04.580]   SportsEngine, which my league uses.
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:08.380]   And I just think it's a great, it was just a great example of how to use an app to solve
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:09.380]   this.
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:10.380]   They have a website and they manage it all.
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:13.460]   So you log in, you can log in on the website if you're a parent and figure out what's
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.460]   actually going on.
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.220]   But the problem is like when it starts raining, which it has been over the last couple weeks,
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:20.020]   all these practices and games are all changing all the time.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:25.820]   And trying to like do a phone tree or an email or whatever, you know, has always been
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:29.060]   the kind of, you end up showing up with a field and there's nobody there and you can't
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.060]   figure out why.
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.960]   And so I just thought it was such a great idea.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.320]   Like whoever came up with this, like when I, you know, I'm not usually impressed by apps
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.600]   very much.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.840]   And the UI on the iOS app is great.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.840]   Or whether it's an iOS app or some kind of weird web app, I'm not sure, but it works
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.160]   really well.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:53.240]   And it's just if you're someone who's organizing one of these, I have to say that I would
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:59.440]   suggest it to do something like this because I can't imagine, you know, I remember what
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.840]   it used to be like and it was mass chaos.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.960]   And this seems to be a pretty straightforward.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.960]   I get the impression.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.200]   I mean, things are changing all the time.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.760]   So I get the impression that whoever's admitting your team can just simply say, oh, we moved
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.880]   the practice to this time.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.700]   And then all I have to do is look at this.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:18.280]   And I know it seems like a, it's a very parenty pick this time.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:22.960]   I don't usually pick parenty picks, but this was, this was one as someone who's trying to
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.160]   do the best I can to show up to as many practices and games as I can.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.160]   It's, it makes my job a lot easier.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.160]   So anyway, that's it.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160]   It's called sports engine.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160]   It's just people.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.560]   I don't know if it's for anything other than little leagues, but as far as I'm concerned,
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.560]   it works great.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.480]   Well, they have basketball players on there.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.480]   So I'm guessing.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:42.480]   So I imagine if it's any sport, I imagine if it's any game sport, I was looking at the
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.200]   app when I was recommending it and I just know what it, how it looks for me.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.600]   But if there's any game sport that you're, that you know, your league is doing, you're
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.120]   trying to figure one out, I don't, I haven't seen any other ones, but I can say that this
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.960]   is a, it works really smoothly.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.720]   I use team snap, which is that's what my daughter's soccer team uses.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.720]   Have you ever tried that?
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.720]   They use team snap.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.720]   Team snap.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   I have not tried team.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.720]   Well, I haven't, I don't have anyone in team.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.080]   I think you have to be in something to understand whether it's good or not.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.880]   You have to be like actually experiencing it.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:11.880]   Right.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:12.880]   Like the real world.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.240]   The tense real world situations of being a soccer mom or dad.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.240]   Right.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.240]   Exactly.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.240]   It's great.
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:24.240]   I think it has like an Apple Watch app.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.920]   So if I'm here, like if I'm at work during a soccer game, I get a little bit of a
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.680]   little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a big deal.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:30.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:33.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:35.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.520]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:23:10.520]   I think I just said, "Wow, this food is great."
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.520]   You're like, "You don't have to always eat oatmeal.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:14.520]   There is life steak in here."
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.520]   It's true.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.520]   You don't have to.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.520]   You can get my AirPods plays, recordings from the game.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.320]   I'm just kidding.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.320]   I'm just pulling out the big lenses.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.920]   All right, Andy, you're up next.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:26.080]   Boy, am I having a lot of fun with this pick.
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:33.240]   This is Autodesk Fusion 360, which is not just a really great design app, but it's really
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:36.760]   one of the best designed apps I've ever seen.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:42.080]   The 3D design apps are really, really complicated because they're usually based upon some piece
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:47.400]   of software that costs $10,000 and you need to go through a $10,000 training course in
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.840]   order to learn how to use it.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.880]   This is how you design a nuclear reactor with these things.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.920]   They're really not designed to be easy, but they've really managed to make a generalized
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:03.760]   app for any sort of physical object that you want to have or have made or just have come
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.920]   out of your head.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:12.160]   It's so, so easy to just conceive it, draw it out, have a perfectly done, perfectly investigated
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:16.960]   3D model of it, and then either it ends there because all you wanted to do was just have
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:23.600]   some fun to see how hard would it be to make a model of my mom's car in this app.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:30.080]   But then you could then take the next step and say, well, here's through a drop down menu,
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:34.880]   send this design to manufacturing facilities and it will be 3D printed or if it's like
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:39.680]   a wood project, they will laser cut the parts for you and ship them back to you.
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:44.960]   Or if you need to have like a thousand of them manufactured, it can have it manufactured
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:48.320]   or it'll print out a set of plans and blueprints.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:53.880]   There seems to be no end to what you can make with this.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.680]   I was just messing around with it while I was sick and paid last week and it's after just
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.200]   messing around for 10 minutes.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.240]   I suddenly remember that, oh, I've always wanted to make like a shelving, a little shelving
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.880]   unit to put on top of the table next to me, so I'll have like a rack for all my equipment
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.880]   on it.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.760]   And then it just, I had the thing done in like less than an hour.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:17.960]   And then over the next couple of days, I kept tweaking it and fine tuning it.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:22.360]   And this again, this is not me learning, knowing how to use it the way that an engineer would
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.280]   know how to use it, but just messing around with it.
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:31.600]   And I now know exactly how it made me inspired to want to try a more complex sort of joinery
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.480]   to make these up right so I can make it simpler.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:37.680]   What if I were to, what if I were to adjust the height like that?
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.760]   It made it very easy for me to make models of, I needed, I need a place for the laptop
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.920]   and I need a place for the Mac mini.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.960]   I need a place for the NAS made it very easy to make simple models of all those things
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.920]   so I could fit them onto the shelves to see how big the shelves could be.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.800]   And then the last thing, you know, you're seeing it right now is I'm probably going to
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.280]   build it when I get back home from New York.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.720]   And so now here is a set of plans that shows me here's what it looks like from every elevation.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.800]   Here's all the measurements I need to go for.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.760]   Like I said, I'm tempted to not take the take my Mac to take my Mac book instead of the iPad
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.160]   because I'm going to be on a train for three or four hours because now I want to play with
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.800]   it a little bit more.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:20.000]   I built this model using, it doesn't force you to build it the right way.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.120]   It lets you just basically play with shapes and how they fit together.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:29.880]   But if you are smart, the way since I built that, I've been online, they have an immense
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.120]   Autodesk has an immense amount of tutorials on how to use this stuff.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:39.320]   I could do things instead by simply, instead of actually putting a piece of wood into that
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:45.200]   area and then duplicating it, then just pushing and pulling it around, I could say that instead
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:50.640]   of this, this piece of, this vertical piece of wood is 12 inches, I could say that I could
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.160]   define that as this is the height of the thing I want to make.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.200]   And then somewhere on another window, there's like a little variable that says, what is
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.640]   the height of this bookshelf?
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.440]   Okay, the height is 12 inches.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:04.200]   So that later on, if I built this correctly, if I decide that actually, you know, I really
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.120]   want to put a second shelf in there so I can have a VCR or some other piece of video
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:13.640]   equipment, I could just simply say, change that number from 12 inches to 18 inches.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.840]   And now the entire thing has changed because the length of that piece of wood is not as
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.680]   hip was not fixed at 12 inches.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:22.400]   It was defined at whatever this variable height is.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.640]   And so you can basically make really huge changes by changing numbers.
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.560]   What I'm saying is that it's really fun to play with, even if you have no intention to
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.120]   build a build a spaceship or a piece of shelving or anything like that, sometimes you're sort
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.280]   of turned off by, I don't want to get into sculpting because, oh, I have to get clay,
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.400]   I have to get armature wire.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:46.640]   I don't want to really get into like Lego or prop modeling because I can't learn how
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.920]   to, I can't buy a laser cutter.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.040]   I can't learn how to work with the molds and stuff like that.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.880]   But if you download this app, which is free for a single person use, if you're just someone
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.320]   messing around with it or just a hobbyist, it's absolutely free.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.520]   If you're using it with your company, then it's a, it's on like a monthly license sort
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.520]   of thing.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:10.920]   You can just sort of just mess around with it and then you'll be surprised that two weeks
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:15.040]   later, you have your, the perfect version of the Millennium Falcon that you've always
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.240]   just wanted to build.
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.240]   And it's a 3D model.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.520]   You can have a 3D printed or you can just have it rendered beautifully and perfectly.
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:25.800]   It has a built in renderer that's just absolutely beautiful.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:30.000]   And so now you can, if you want the Millennium Falcon, the background of all of your, all
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.040]   of your cousin's wedding pictures, you can make a model or download a model of the Millennium
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.680]   Falcon, put it there.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:39.840]   The last thing I'll shut up now because I get, this is something I'm getting pretty
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:40.840]   excited about.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:47.800]   Recently, I found out that it also, it also has a built in link to, to a tool catalog.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:52.800]   It has a built in link to the whole McMaster car hardware catalog, which is like the biggest
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.240]   hardware store in the world because it's just, it's a distributor.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:01.040]   So I'm going to be holding some of the stuff, some of these pieces of this book shelf together
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:06.920]   with screws so I can just basically go through the entire catalog, say, Oh, here's, there's
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:11.720]   a brass Phillips flathead screw, maybe, maybe an inch and a half.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:17.200]   And so you tap on that, it will automatically put into your model a 3D model of that exact
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.200]   part.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.200]   So now I can basically place all the screws where they need to go.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.120]   Like, Oh no, if it's only an inch and a half, it won't bite into the other piece of wood,
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:28.080]   it needs to be two inches, replace it with a two inch version of it.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.160]   So now when I'm done, I know that I don't need to buy a whole package of 20 screws.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.800]   I only need eight of them.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.480]   I know I need the two inch one of them.
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.640]   I could click a button, just have them ship to me.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:41.520]   It's like, Oh my God, it's like, it's like wishing for something to exist.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.920]   And now it exists, or at least the plans for it exists.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.120]   So download and play with it.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.120]   It's just so much fun to play with.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.960]   I want you to send it off to a manufacturer and make me one.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.880]   Oh, maybe I'd be kind of beefy.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.200]   I've been thinking, I mean, I've been looking for a tech shelf.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.280]   Like it's really complicated.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:09.320]   You know, we have four iPads, five iPhones, three laptops, you know, four different, you
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.960]   know, the AirPods and everything to charge.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.960]   And I've been looking for like the perfect table.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.200]   And now I should just build my own.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.440]   And that's, well, that's the fun of this.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.800]   It's like, it's so easy.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.960]   This is this basic thing is something simple.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.720]   I build stuff like this really, really easily because it's easy to make, you know, boneheads
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.320]   sort of just screw it together, glue it together, sort of joints, just cut them into length.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.840]   But when you start to see how parts fit together, you start to get more ambitious.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.040]   And now I'm thinking that, well, you know, there's the shelves.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.840]   I'm using like this woodstock that happened to have a lot of in the house.
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.400]   So that makes like sort of a thick shelf.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:42.920]   What if I were to make those like hidden storage for like the cable runs so that all the cables
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:45.240]   are sort of hidden inside these shelves?
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.200]   And what if I were to make another sort of thing that can fit next to it as like sort
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:54.800]   of an easel for the iPad that I could also lift off and put onto the desk and you just
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:58.600]   get more and more ambitious as you go because it's easy to mess up with the source of stuff.
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.200]   You tend to believe that all things are possible with this.
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:02.200]   I know.
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.920]   I mean, you might make a couple.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:07.680]   And if you if you're like version number two or version number one, we'll talk.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.360]   OK, well, I think for postage and handling.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.320]   I've seen where you keep your dongles.
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.760]   I don't mean to be forward.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.760]   You're cabinet.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:16.960]   You're with all your little drawers.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.760]   And I think maybe you could come up with something that works even better than that.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:24.680]   And then maybe you would have another career in manufacturing these and selling them.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.360]   I'll have another career and one and a half fewer fingers.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:28.360]   Oh, no.
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:31.760]   Didn't you say you just send it off to someone else to manufacture?
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:36.080]   You can, but it's like it's fun.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.520]   You know, it's it's it's fun to not just not just the pride of doing it.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:48.160]   But when you cut like hand cut joints like that, it's fun to just take a take would turn
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.640]   into sawdust.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:54.840]   And then oh my god, these these things actually fit together like it's Ikea furniture that's
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.520]   built to be assembled.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.000]   And then you're like, oh, that's nice.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.680]   And it's it's fun.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:05.800]   Yeah, but when when the when the orders keep start rolling in, you know, 100 300 a day,
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:09.240]   you might have to well that that's when we outsourced it to to Chinese factories.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:12.040]   Only one that doesn't pay its labor force as well as Apple does.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:17.360]   God, the month the month they throw the way on safety and health and well being.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.000]   We can we can margin up.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000]   We can margin.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   What do you call up?
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.200]   All right, Renee, what do you got?
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.200]   All right.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:27.160]   So Apple also put out in addition to red iPhones and new iPads.
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.000]   They put out some new Apple Watch bands.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.800]   So these are the Nike one.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:35.200]   This one is a holdover from the original Nike plus Apple Watch.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:40.200]   You can get the black and volt color now, just like an acid bright acid neon green.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.000]   You can also get this stuff together.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.720]   You can also get just this white one that has it's a little off white with white inserts
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.560]   and you can get what they call anthracite, which is kind of a dark, charcoly gray with
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.600]   black inside and they're all really nice.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:57.200]   But you know, those are I don't want to call them conservative.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.440]   They're kind of sporty.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:02.640]   But if you really want to get into it, there's all new striped nylon bands.
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:07.560]   So here's a couple of them on watches, but there's all sorts of new colors that you can
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:09.680]   get for these two and all this a little lower down.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.560]   Did you buy them in a six pack?
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.640]   No, so I got a couple of these as review units and I bought a couple of them and actually
[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:18.760]   someone will be repurposed as gifts because most people in my family have Apple Watch
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.440]   at this point and they always like the new collections.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.760]   So let me just bring these over.
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:23.760]   There we go.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:26.560]   So I mean, I've seen people sort of match them to their shirts and I'll see them just
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.360]   wear them like because they're fun and bright and shiny.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:32.680]   And I'm told by people way smarter than me that these are the hot new looks and if you
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.160]   look through fashion magazines, you'll see a lot of these sorts of colors coming in the
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.600]   new spring collections.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.480]   I just see, oh, bright, shiny and new.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.920]   So I don't really, you know, I'm not I'm not all vogue about it.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:44.360]   But I do think that some of them are really nice.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.760]   The blues are really nice.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.600]   Some of them are a little bit candy cane, but you know, some people really like to make
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:54.200]   giant splashes of color with an otherwise, you know, very utilitarian design.
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:58.800]   So there's also some new leathers and the new leathers match the new leather Apple cases
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.080]   and the new vinyls as well.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.720]   So if you want to spruce up your Apple watch look, the nylon started, I think, $50 and
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:08.440]   I think the these sport bands are roughly the same price and the leathers go up to about
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.440]   $150.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.000]   But for birthday, special occasions, whatever, there's some new Hermes as well.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.800]   Of course, Apple's never found a better way of removing me from my money than they have
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.360]   with Apple Watch band.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:22.000]   But yeah, a lot of really great new stuff for the spring.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.720]   Yeah, I had not seen the Hermes in the wilds until I saw Georgia in the wild.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:29.720]   And it's nice.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:32.000]   It looks nothing like my knockoff.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.240]   And so yeah, it was very jealous.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.160]   I like all the new leather colors.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.680]   Yeah, there's there's a lime as well.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.080]   And it's sort of like doing a berry red this year.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.160]   And again, like they use the French words for the different colors, but not for the buckles.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.760]   So it gets a little bit of penetrable, but they're all very nice looking.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:53.440]   And those Hermes bands fit on the regular watch, right?
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.280]   You don't need that they all are interchangeable.
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.720]   Georgia has hers on a rose gold sport watch.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:02.880]   It does feel weird to have the band be more expensive than the watch, but maybe that's
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:03.880]   a regular thing.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:04.880]   I don't know.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.480]   I mean, like so I had so many like because I've had watches for years, but I've never
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.920]   been all horologist about it.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.240]   And like my boss Kevin Mitchell is like he's got like three omegas and a bunch of Rolex's
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.520]   and he's like a John Biggs level collector.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.440]   And you know, Vince the Gleyard from Slashgear too, they are talking about their panorite
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.000]   bands that are thousands of dollars.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.440]   You know, so it's a totally different.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.520]   It's like audio equipment.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:27.960]   You can spend every dollar you have on this stuff if that is what you want to do.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.320]   So Apple stuff is fairly constrained.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.680]   If you go to the Hermes store, even like I went to the Hermes store at SFO on my way
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:37.640]   home and the SF the Hermes version of the double tour is way more expensive than the
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.200]   Apple version of the Hermes.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.520]   It's like $3,000 or something.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.960]   So yeah, you can spend as much money as you have on this stuff you want to.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:46.960]   I don't recommend doing that.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.560]   You know, save it for the audio equipment, but you know, it's a good way to add a little
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.040]   bit of fun to your existing watch.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:56.480]   I think I see smoke coming out of Alex's head as he's like, just give me a second hand.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.480]   That's all I want.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.480]   Like no more bands.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.120]   All I want is a second hand.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.400]   That's all I need.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.400]   All I want is a second hand.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.960]   Like it's just a second hand like look down and actually know what the real time is.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:10.480]   You know, the watch kit team Alex just, you know, while you're next time you're in Cupertino,
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.840]   get a megaphone stand out front of IL and just go second hands.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.840]   Second.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.120]   I think we just need it.
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.840]   We all need to gang up at WWDC and just walk over.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840]   Second hand second.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:22.840]   Second.
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:25.880]   In fact, maybe I'll just print t-shirts that everyone can wear at WWDC.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:26.880]   I'll just hand them out.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:27.880]   Second.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.880]   What time is it?
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880]   I don't know because no seconds.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:30.880]   Yes.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.800]   Well, you know, you brought up you threw out Alex that you think maybe they think it makes
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:35.800]   people nervous.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.080]   I wonder if that is real like that they've thought they've tried it.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.120]   I know, but there's so many faces.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.800]   Why not just have one except actually call it.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:44.800]   Except that seconds.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:45.800]   Mm hmm.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.800]   Got it.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.800]   All right.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.320]   My pick is a book, an actual book.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:52.240]   It is the upstart by Brad Stone.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.920]   It's about Uber and Airbnb, how Uber Airbnb and the killer companies of the New Silicon
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.920]   Valley are changing the world.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:02.800]   Like I said before, I like to read fiction, but I interviewed Brad Stone on triangulation
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:05.720]   that will air in a few weeks.
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:06.720]   And it was great.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.680]   He writes for Bloomberg and he wrote the big book about Amazon called the Everything Store.
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.480]   And this was a real page turner.
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:22.640]   I was surprised at how I kept being enthralled by this book when it ends in December of 2016.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.320]   So you know the story up till then.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.680]   And so much even has happened with Uber and Airbnb since then.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:32.960]   But what I loved about it is where you know, as journalists were like tied to this relentless
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:36.400]   news cycle and we hear all this bad news about Uber and we just say like, oh, can you
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.400]   believe it?
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:43.440]   And then just to read the back story about these two companies and really unique companies
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:50.440]   that came about at a time really right after the Facebook IPO, right when Obama was inaugurated.
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.920]   And they came up at the same time.
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:54.800]   It's like when you think about the comedians that come up at the same time.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:58.800]   It's like Uber and Airbnb's came up at the same time.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.920]   And they just started this, you know, people call it the ride sharing economy.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:07.280]   But really to me, and Brad Stone coins this term I think of it, the trust economy where
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.760]   we're putting our bodies into Ubers or into Airbnb's.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.280]   And it's just this whole different thing than Amazon or Google or any of it or Facebook
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.920]   or any of the Apple for that matter of any of the companies that came before just really
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.680]   trusting these companies.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:26.360]   It's a really great read whether you're into business or technology or you just want to
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:31.880]   know what's going on with these two companies that really change the way that we move people
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:37.040]   around and store them places for lack of a better word.
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:44.040]   It is a great book.
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:48.040]   Anybody read it or read other Brad Stone books?
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.040]   No, not me.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.040]   But I think books are great.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:53.040]   I mean, I own these articles and everything else.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.040]   Is it available in Audible yet or is it still just?
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.040]   I am sure it is.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.040]   It's available in Audible.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:02.040]   You can see yourself reading it.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:03.040]   I'm sure it is.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.040]   I'm not much of a unit asker.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.040]   I'm not sure it's available.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.040]   But yeah, I think that is...
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.040]   I don't know.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:14.000]   I've been trying to get myself to read real books at night instead of going through Twitter
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:20.040]   or Instagram or Facebook just to make my brain work again.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.040]   Yeah, I like the listen.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:29.160]   I know I tweet stupid things, but help me get off the streets.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.160]   You're usually asleep Andy by the time I'm going through Twitter in bed.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.480]   So you're usually asleep by then.
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.160]   So yeah, it's not you that I'm blaming.
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.960]   Yeah, no.
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.960]   I think that...
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:44.880]   When you were talking about it, I hadn't really thought about it until you said it,
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:49.840]   but I also realized that probably one of the perfect storms of the ride-sharing thing
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:55.520]   was also the huge surge in unemployment and underemployment that happened right at about
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.880]   the same time that those companies were launching, that people were more willing to do that.
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.200]   And I know there's some folks in my...
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:08.400]   I have some cousins that are actually Uber drivers and they love it.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:12.480]   So I think that's part of what people, when people complain about Uber, I always think
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:17.680]   of my cousin who tells me how great it is because he gets to design his own day and
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:20.640]   he has his day the way he wants it and does his thing.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.480]   And I'm sure that would be just as good with Lyft or anything else as well.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:25.120]   But the...
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.880]   I think that it's the idea of having that flexibility.
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:30.320]   I think we're just going to see more and more of.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:33.160]   I think that that kind of...
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:36.000]   So it is interesting to see how these guys are doing it because there's something like
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.400]   Uber I use almost every day.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.720]   The Airbnb I won't touch.
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:44.680]   The idea of like saying someone's house just...
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.240]   So it's interesting like the safe space thing that goes on.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:50.880]   Like Airbnb I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, I won't."
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.400]   That doesn't work for me at all, but Uber doesn't.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.280]   For whatever reason, I don't know why it doesn't bother me.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.680]   Hmm, interesting.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:01.320]   Well, Alex, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:06.720]   Is there anything that you are working on that we should know about?
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.920]   I'm going to be in Austin, Texas tomorrow and tomorrow night.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.920]   If you follow me on Twitter, if you hear this, I don't know where to go.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.880]   I don't know where to go yet, but I'm going to try to do a meetup.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:22.600]   So keep your eye on my Twitter feed or if you follow me on Facebook or whatever, I'll
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:23.600]   post...
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.400]   I mean, my Twitter will post to my Facebook, that kind of thing.
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:29.160]   But I'll do something later today where I announce where I'm going to go.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:34.360]   But I'm always looking, especially to meet people who are in production because we're
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:38.640]   always looking for people to know in the local area, but even just people who are listeners
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:45.240]   or whatever, I'll tweet it out and put it on Facebook in the next couple hours as soon
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:47.240]   as I figure out exactly where I want to meet.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:50.640]   But somewhere in Austin, sure we'll find a cool place to go.
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.080]   So if you're in Austin, stay tuned and check that out.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.080]   Awesome.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:58.360]   AlexLinzi.com, PixelCore.com.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.360]   How about you Renee?
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.160]   Anything that we need to know that you're working on?
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.160]   Just Mac Bakery-Klee.
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.160]   Nothing else.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:09.120]   Yeah, we're covering all the new stuff.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:13.680]   So if you have any questions about iOS 10.3 or WatchOS, I forget I'm on 3.2.
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.840]   All the new stuff, Trinity Caldwell, Lori Gilmick, as far as the entire team just killing it.
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.080]   So go down there.
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:22.280]   I had very little to do with it this time, but they did amazing jobs.
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.000]   Go to iamward.com and check it out.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.600]   Ooh, Padnquill's Leather Backpack.
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:26.600]   Ooh, that looks nice.
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:27.600]   Gotta check that out.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.760]   They do great stuff.
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:31.800]   ReneeRitchie.com, iamward.com.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.240]   Andy, what are you working on besides tweeting funny things?
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.960]   Uh, tomorrow I'm going to be covering the Samsung Galaxy S8 launch.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:44.800]   So a lot of stuff about Android, not anything that anyone here would be interested in.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.400]   But I'm got, so I got a couple Apple reviews coming up.
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.760]   That's first one's going to be next Tuesday, I think, if it gets through editing.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:56.840]   Either it'll take five days for them to edit it, or it's going to take four days for me
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:00.440]   to cut it down to 800 words so they can get it out in less than an hour.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:03.480]   So we'll see which one wins out first.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:08.600]   C-W-O-B dot com and not go @anaco on Twitter.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.720]   And thank you for joining me.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.960]   Leo will be back next week.
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:12.960]   I had a great time.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.520]   Hopefully he will invite me back again.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:19.640]   Definitely going to make the title something about putting in hot tubs.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:23.520]   So Leo will come back probably.
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:24.520]   And yeah, thanks.
