[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Welcome back everybody to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And I've taken over the helm once again.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Leo is still out of the country.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   He's back next week.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   This is Alex of course.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And I am going to be kind of trying to rope us in here.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   If coming in from the celestial waste to bandwidth,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Andy Inaco.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Andy.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Joyduck's new well to all in Sundry.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Yeah, this is -- so we're recording this.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I think this will come out -- you know, it's 24th for me.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It's the 23rd that we're recording it.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So it'll come out right before Christmas.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And Scott Warren is coming in from Gig Harbor.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Hey Scott.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hey there everybody.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Happy all of the affiliated holidays to you.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   All of the above.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And coming from all the way across the pond.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   This is truly a global podcast today.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Donna Callister from ScreenCastsOnline.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Hey Scott.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hi guys.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Happy New Well, Happy Festivities everybody.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Yes, it's across three continents today, isn't it?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Asia, Europe, and U.S.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So we're pretty much wrapped all the way around the world now.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And it's actually pretty clear.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Relatively clear.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   The one we're doing.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Shouldn't we do like a Jim McKay thing right now?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Spinning the globe.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Spinning the globe.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Spinning the globe.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Yes.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I think we're more like the British Empire.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   The sun never -- the sun never sets on Mac break week.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   That's the wrong.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   We're so dang on special.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We got two different days worth of programming here.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   You go.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's a different day in Japan.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It is.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It is.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You know, you know, the funny thing about it is that in Japan,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   you know, America really is yesterday's news.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I mean, it's always like this weird thing where you suddenly realize
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   oh, it's only Tuesday there.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Now, I have a question about that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I want to see if this worked.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Could you check what Apple stock will be tomorrow?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I was starting to think about that.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I was like, man, I was going to make a lot of money if I figured this out.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   You know, I could -- I could -- you know, but it's a very odd reality to be here.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And you really get this vision on the future sometimes in Japan.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I mean, I think they take that to heart.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   You know, I have -- we just -- this crazy electronics, everything.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   You go to a store and there are little screens everywhere yelling at you.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Yelling at you.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And there's actually people yelling at you as well about some product.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And I look at them when I'm doing it and I'm like, your Jedi mind tricks don't work on me.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I can't -- I have to do what you're saying.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It just -- to me, I imagine it would seem more useful if I understood what they were saying.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So anyway, have you guys seen this -- the YouTube Mac versus PC?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I have, yes.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   You have seen it?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Not the usual Mac versus PC, but the --
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   the animated one.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   The animated one.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Have you guys seen it?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So this -- this came out only a couple of days -- I guess it's bad for a while, but it kind
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   of hit the -- you know, it hit its -- it got its groove over the last -- the last week or so.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And this is --
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Now, should we say, is this the Apple animated one or the -- the -- the -- the fan animated one?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   This is the fan animated one.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Oh, I haven't seen the fan animated.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Oh, no.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   This is the -- okay.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So there's an Apple animated one.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   That was the good one for Christmas.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Then there's a fan animated one to take a look at.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It's Mac versus PC.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's a -- basically, Mac versus PC meets Transformers.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And, yeah, so -- so here we -- so it's -- so let's see if I can -- I don't know.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Can you -- oh, yeah, I don't think you guys can hear that.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I don't have the piping that Leo has.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I think we talked about this last time.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   But anyway, you should definitely check it out.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It's just good clean fun for Mac fans.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Now, one of the things that we -- we failed to talk about, and a lot of people have reminded me
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   that we failed to talk about last week, was that Steve is not going to be at Macworld.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Nope.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Do we think that it was odd that the announcement came out right after we finished recording?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Nope, that was planned.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   How soon was it after you finished?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   An hour.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It was an hour.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   An hour.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It was an hour.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So the -- the author of "Question is, which one of us is the mole?"
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Don, I -- now, I'm not going to rule you out.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I'm saying you're unlikely.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   But don't use your passport and stay within city limits until we --
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   it was a little frustrating.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You know, and I have to admit, just in his defense, I talked to Paul Kent and he assured us that he had no idea.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   You know, this is really something that Apple had kept quiet.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And then finally rolled out.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So why do we think that Steve's not showing up?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Is it a big deal?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Andy, Andy, what do you think?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Not a big deal at all.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Apple is not a terribly sentimental company, especially when sentiment gets in the way of what they want to do.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And what they want to do is control every aspect of their business, control every single timetable,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   and every time they make an announcement, they want to make sure they control every way that that announcement is made.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I did write about this for the SunTimes.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Like, I had to toss the column I had planted in a substitute new one.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   But the basic point was that it's incredible that for years now,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Apple has always had this totally artificial deadline on their calendar year after year after year
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   that they have to have something to announce, something big to announce for Mackerel Expo in January,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   whether something was ready to ship or not.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   If Apple had a disappointing keynote, that actually let people down.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And some of those people would be people who make the stock go up and down.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So by simply saying we're not going to be presenting the big Steve Jobs keynote anymore,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   we're not going to be participating in Mackerel anymore.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   They do a big leap forward and basically taking control of all their announcements.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I mean, you notice that more and more often, the old calendar of Apple announcements has sort of become antique.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   You used to be able to count on, there's always going to be a big announcement in January.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   There's always going to be a big announcement at WWDC at these specific public events.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   But Apple's been taking all of those events in-house.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Now, it's not a general public event when they announce a new thing.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   They invite members of the media.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   They invite certain VIPs and analysts to the Apple campus.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And they control the horizontal and the vertical.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   As for not actually taking part in Mackerel at all.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That was a big surprise to me.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   But once again, that kind of makes sense from a business point of view because it just caused such a bloody fortune to be there.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And plus, it stresses us out just as journalists to be at a big trade show for three or four days.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   The one thing I noticed, and I can only imagine, it's magnified for Apple as we did a booth last year.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And basically, it means that there's no Christmas break, there's no new years, there's no nothing.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Because it's all prep.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And for Apple, that's magnified by a hundred.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And it's this huge amount of money.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And a lot of people that I've known that work at Apple, a lot of them have been a little edgy about Mackerel
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   because it means that they're always working through Christmas.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   You know that you've kind of made a bad decision when you're at a place and doing something, you're thinking,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   "If I weren't here doing this, I could be at work right now."
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Now, Don, you've written a couple articles, actually a couple blogs since the announcement.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   What are your opinions in this area?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I have to agree with Andy, to be honest, that there are good sound business reasons for doing it.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   I think it probably goes a bit deeper than that as well.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I mean, the double whammy of both Steve not doing the keynote and also pulling out of the Expo itself
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   are two separate things.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And cleverly introduce both at the same time to deflect one off each other.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   But I think it's actually the start of the plans for the succession of Steve in that probably the best time to do it
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   is when the stock prices deflated anyway, because everybody knows as soon as the mayor's hit the Steve,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   not going to be there, the stock's going to take a plunge.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And it's already quite low at the moment, so probably now is a good time to start that process.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And the fact that they bring in fill in to do the keynote, I think it really is just the start of the succession plan
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   of trying to break decouple the Apple and Steve Jobs influence every time that these announcements are made.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   So start bringing some of the other key players with an Apple into the proceedings.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   It's not going to happen overnight, but I think this is the very much the start of the succession planning
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   for when Steve does eventually go, albeit for personal reasons or for, you know, I don't want to go down the sickness bit,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   which I don't think really is the issue.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I think it's probably just the planning ahead and now is the time they've started to introduce the succession planning.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Now, Scott, do you think that we're going to see a small keynote or do you think they're going to come out guns blazing?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Well, you know, let me just ask you guys a question. Having watched the difference between Steve Jobs, give the keynote speech
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and then bringing on the guy from AT&T with his note cards to introduce the iPhone,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   would you want to be the one to step up on that stage after Steve?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   No, because I'm betting no. I wouldn't.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I'm guessing the keynote won't be as big a deal.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Phil is a great guy. I don't think he can carry it anyway, anywhere near as well as Steve, whether or not,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I don't be so proud.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   But admittedly, he does way better than a lot of these other, just about anybody else who comes up.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   He's got the most practice. He's got the most energy.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   That's just it. He's a great guy. But, I mean, we're talking about, you know, a person who's like a really great guitar player
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   being asked to step on stage after, you know, Jimmy Hendrix performs.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I mean, it's going to be a challenge.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I don't know. I think everybody's right. I think there's a zillion reasons.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I don't think there's one reason for this.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   But I do know that Apple likes to be in control of ever-a-thing, and they haven't been in control of Macworld.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   So, you know, this helps free them from that.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And, you know, this year, I don't think we'll see a huge drop in attendance,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   although there might be some just from the economy more than anything else.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   But what really will be interesting will be to see is, you know, if next year is impacted by what happens,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   this year, and we all remember that, you know, IDG was like, you know, hey, Macworld's going to be going fine
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   in Boston without Apple. Don't worry about it. And then, of course, that didn't work out.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And they're making those same claims now whether or not it'll work out.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   You know, and that's really the thing I'm interested in.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I think this year we'll have a good show. If not, for any reason, other than everybody will say,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   hey, this could be the last Macworld. Let's all make sure we make it.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Well, how does IDG make this a great show without Apple?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It has to be an educational conference. It has to be focused.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It stops being a commercial trade show and starts being about giving information to users.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I think that I have no insider information, but I would guess that next year you're going to see a much,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   much beefier conference track. I think that you're going to see that the organizers are going to try to get
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   much as good as the names are that they already have to give these sessions and give these seminars.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I think that they're going to try to bring in some even heavier hitters, like people from mass media.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I wouldn't be surprised if this is a year that they say, you know what? I bet that the cast of the Big Bang
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Theory are all big Mac users. How much would it cost for us to bring them in and just have them come up and talk
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   about Macs about how they use it on the show? I know it's just because they're famous people, but people like famous people.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   And so let's get some more.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   You know, it turns out that Barack Obama is a Mac user.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   There we go. Invite him. I think we got a keynote from the president.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   I think you're in advance. Maybe they can work that in.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   You know, if we don't have Steve, you know, maybe we can get Barack to give him the key.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   That is somebody who could actually fill Steve's shoes quite nicely.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   No, no, then you see that's what you see. Steve announced. You know what? I think I will keynote next year.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Yeah, that would be funny, Andy. That would be funny.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   I was just walking like Bob Hope and like Bob Hope during the Christmas special.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   I was I was I was keynoteing across the hall. I had to come in and say hi and see how you guys were doing.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Now, now I have to say though, I mean, I was really disappointed about the absence of Steve this year, but the fact that
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Apple weren't going to be there next year, it really didn't phase me. I must admit because I mean, I'm a relative newbie
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   to the to Mac. Well, this is this will be my third time this year, but on the other two times I've been.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Although it's nice to see Apple there. I didn't really get a lot out of Apple actually being on the show floor,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   even though they must have got a huge expense for the size of the booths and you know, the number of people that they've got there.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   But you know, and I know it's one of the things they've said is that everything, you know, you can go to an Apple store now
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   and see all the Apple gear. I found that to be very true in that I probably spent no more than 20 or 30 minutes
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   around the Apple booth or listening to an Apple presentation and then just moved on and went to see all the rest
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   all the other interesting things with on within the show floor. I think the absence of Apple is really going to be more of its credibility
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   and its standing in the industry rather than sort of removing value from the conference to be honest.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   I totally agree. Totally agree with that. At the last five Mac worlds, I bet combined. I didn't spend combined 20 minutes
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   at the Apple booth out of the last five.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Yeah, and I have to admit that for me, the value of Mac world are the 10 to 20 foot booths.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   They're these little companies that are doing stuff, especially or if you go over to the, I think it's the developers area
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   or the, oh that's the best area right there.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Yeah, so you have these little stands that someone paid $2,500 for whatever I mean.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   It's the smallest they can get into that they can get on the show floor and it is a, it's a great place for you to go
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   and see little companies doing the next big thing.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   The ones that succeed in that area are going to be the bigger booths, you know, a year or two or three years down the road.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And to me, wandering through there is much more useful because the big booths are representing companies that have lots of PR.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They have lots of exposure. They don't really need Mac world to do this.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   What the people who really need it and the people that I need to be there are these little booths with little, with the next new thing.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Not to mention the networking, Alex. I mean, in the hallway, I mean, where else?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   I mean, Andy lives in Boston, you know, I live on the West Coast.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   We don't get to see that off. And I can spend a few minutes with the great Andy and not go in person.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   I mean, you get a chance to talk to people and the last, again, the last five Mac worlds, I've probably negotiated numerous five and six figure deals just as a result of the networking with new clients and new opportunities.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And those are things that I don't believe would have happened without having the proximity we had, you know, in the hallway.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   So, and I think that's one of the things that is hopefully we're going to see IDG really focus on is making sure that it really becomes an experience.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Like, this is one of the things and, you know, I've told them in the past is that, you know, for me, it was a real eye opener to go to a TED.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   You know, and I know people are very, you know, they, I was a little like, okay, everyone's a little overboard about TED.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Until I went. And it is the best organized conference I've ever seen in my entire life.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   It is so, and it is so designed around everyone having a unified experience and then everyone having time to network.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   You know, there's one big room, everyone watches it, then there's huge breaks in between where people can, you know, talk about it and, you know, talk to each other and so on and so forth.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And it doesn't matter that they put all the videos up online, you still want to be in the experience because the networking is so important.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And hopefully that's going to be something that keeps on building in Macworld.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Hopefully without a $6,000 price tag.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Well, yeah, it's $6,000. You should get a, you should get, it should be a well organized.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I was going to say for six grand, I'm guessing Paul Kent could make each and every one of our Macworld experiences quite special.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   You have to get all the fun to be spending $6,000.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I think Paul's on the phone right now, in fact.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   They'll pick you up when I'm on.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Just going back to the keynote again, though, you know, with the fact that Phil's doing it.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   I'm a bit conflicted in that I think I agree.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Well, there's two different points of view here.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   One, yes, we probably, and I think everyone's expecting it to be a fairly low key keynote because you're not going to be there and, you know, they're trying to move away.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   The assumption is they're trying to move away from these big announcements.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   But again, if they do that and they sort of leave Paul, Phil Schiller up there on stage with nothing to announce, it's really going to add fuel to the fire that Apple is not really Apple without Steve.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   So I am sort of conflicted in that, yes, I can see why they want to move away from the big announcements at Macworld.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   But again, they really need to give him something to wow the crowds with.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   They need to really put the buzz back on this sheet.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   If we're, if a lot of us are right about the reasons why Apple moved, they don't really have any investment in making Macworld a really important experience.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   If anything, they'd want to make sure that when they have the next Apple media event in February, say that that's when Steve comes out and razzle dazzles them.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And that's when you see the hoverboard with the Apple logo on it.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And that's when you see the pill- padded iPhone because you see, you know, the excitement is here at the Apple campus.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   It's not in the Boscone Center.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   So I would be, I think that, I mean, Phil is really up against it.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I mean, he's like the comedian who has to come on right after the Beatles run the Ed Sullivan show because I don't see any way that anybody could live up to or come to the expectations of this keynote.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And Andy, for 10.2, was that comedian?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Billy Crystal played him in the movie.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Oh, that's enough to get nine points.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I think it's real.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   I think Israel's going to be more of an MC.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   He'll be sort of bringing the rest of the crew on the long have the demons of fame.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   They're going to have chicken wire up just like in the Blues Brothers.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Just throw the group and put them off as both as they get to throw.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Well, you know, I think that they might, I think that Apple, I personally agree with Don.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   I think that we're going to see some announcements.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   I think that we're looking at what Alex, look at the timing of what we've received recently.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I mean, they're going to announce the next version of the OS.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   We kind of, you know, they're going to talk about that because they now have these rolling announcements where over three or four trade shows they keep talking about the next OS.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   But I mean, what is it going to be? The new, you know, iMovie?
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I mean, come on.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   They've got brand new cinema displays.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   They just did a new MacBook Pro.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Well, so it may, maybe, maybe something like that, maybe new iLife, maybe now there's rumors that people have been looking in and they think that might be new iMacs and Mac minis to be released.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   There is a, you know, some iMacs Mac minis, possibly something like iLife.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   The, um, yeah, that best though, everything you're talking about is a upgrade.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Now, the question, but the real question is, iPhone, there's no big thing.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Well, and that's the big question is whether they're going to put out some kind of netbook, whether they're going to, you know, catch up with that trend that I think Apple has fallen behind on.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I also think that they're going to wow the crowd.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   I think they could wow the crowd.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   I don't know if they're going to.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   I don't know how many presentations you guys have seen about OpenCL.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   This is something that's been kind of like the sleeping giant.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Have you guys seen much about OpenCL?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   No, I have not you see.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Yeah, this is a, you know, a technology that Apple has proposed and it's now an open technology that allows you to basically take CPU processes and move them to the GPU.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And the performance possibilities are pretty astounding.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   When you move away from the CPU and into the GPU, there are there is talk.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I haven't seen it of compression times.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   For instance, you know, being able to go 40 to 100 times faster on the GPU.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   And so these are the kind of things instead of just throwing graphics up and that may seem like a little thing, but it means everything speeds up.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Everything and I think that I think we're going to see.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I think this is a big piece of what's coming with Snow Leopard and I think it's going to be interesting to see, you know, how that how that comes out.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   But who knows?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Well, they need to get into the marketing side of Snow Leopard now, don't they?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Which is the, you know, the performance aspect and the scalability aspect.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And it's really unleashing the power of the current Mac platform that people already have with all the multi processes and everything.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   You know, as we know, most applications don't really make use of the dual processor.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   And of course, the dual processor, in mind, the multi core processor that we have in the Mac Pro's, unless it's against a specialized video encoding software.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   But, you know, we've all got this really powerful platform on our desks or on our laps.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And now Snow Leopard is actually going to be able to sort of take that to the next level.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And I think that's probably going to be a really big marketing push.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Well, they have to start the marketing push because are we, are they going to really charge?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Right now, it seems like unless they say a lot more about Snow Leopard for some people, I think I talked to someone about it, who knows a fair bit about Apple.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Hardware and software. And they were like, well, I don't know if I want to pay for an upgrade just to have bug fixes.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   You know, I mean, you know, that there's not any new features or something new.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Cool. But I think they're very much like that down there.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Haven't they with Snow Leopard? They sort of kept it just to developers.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   But, and again, I think it's a classic ploy that, you know, don't announce the new feature until the client close to launch.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   And oh, by the way, you know, we said there were no new features, but you can do this.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   You can do this. We can do this. We've introduced this.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   You know, it's something old and those stability, stability would be a great view feature.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   We know that Andy wants to see the net book right, Andy.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   I want to see it. Yeah. But I'm sure that that's exactly the sort of headline grabbing, attention grabbing thing that Steve Jobs wants to have his picture taken holding it up.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And I'm not going to trust the two and outside venue.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   But the question is, does Steve, here's the question I have is, does Steve want to have his pictures taken?
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Or does he want to start this process of showing that we can have exciting things and they'll work out really well with or without me?
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   That's only here. That's only here.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   That's only here. That's only here.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   That's going to have a boomerang effect. He wants his face out there.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Also, all the information that I have access to says that he's actually quite healthy.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   In terms of real health problems, unfortunately, rather fortunately, he's private enough that I don't have access to his medical records.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   But I've yet to see anything that is substantive that says that he is experiencing any health problems.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   But if it really is important for Apple to make sure that everybody knows that Apple is about more than Steve Jobs, part of that is assuring them that Steve isn't going anywhere, ironically enough.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   I think if he's truly sick or something like that, then there won't be any more special events with Steve.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   If he's not sick, then I think he'll be back in the limelight, but it's just a matter.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I think Andy's statement about control is the most likely accurate of all of our speculation about why these things are happening.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Apple likes to control things and think about it.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   If you hold a little press conference at one infinity loop and it's only available by invitation, everybody hopes to get one of those invitations and people fly from friggin' Paris to cover whatever it is,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   they can get all the news media they want without spending the money on Macworld.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   They don't need it.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   We need Macworld because we need to find a way to strengthen our relationships within the Mac community.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   We don't have Apple stores and we don't have Steve and we don't have that ability for the press.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   But I think if he's ill, we won't see more of him.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   If he's not ill, we will.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I don't think there's any reason to transition to Phil or anybody else if he's not sick.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Right.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   They have a responsibility, though, to...
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   We see all the time as soon as any rumor of his wellbeing, the stock limits and everyone's with the pin arms.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   It's going to take a long time to actually transition to a different culture with an Apple.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   It's going to take years to do that.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Perhaps now is the time to actually start gradually.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   I'm not going to say that we're never going to see Steve again.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   He's never going to present again.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Obviously, when they do roll out the netbook, which I agree with Andy, I don't think it's going to be a Macworld.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   I think it's too big a deal.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   That's the...
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   It still would want to be involved with that.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   But every other event over the next two or three years, I'm sure we're going to seem to go more and more into the background.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And this is just really the very first start of that.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Now, have you seen that Walmart is now going to be selling iPhones?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Now, here's the statement of this whole process.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   The statement of power is that Apple only gave up $2 off the retail to Walmart.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And if anyone knows how Walmart does their negotiations, that's a feat.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   They're the company that would know jokes.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Well, you say that you can't make this any cheaper.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Well, we measured and found out that your headphone cord is two.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   24 inches long.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   When the industry standard is actually 20 inches long.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   So that's the center half you can chop off right there.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   So that's why we're not paying you that amount of money.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And so the...
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   They know how much it costs you in China to make whatever you're making.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And they tell manufacturers how much they're going to pay.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   This is how much you need to sell it to us for.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   And people do it.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   The weird thing is they also do things like say, well, the thing is we think that you're using too high a grade of plastic for the product.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   We think that your quality control is too obsessive.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Right.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   So that's why the scary thing would have been a special Walmart version of the iPhone that's made out of pressed wood chips and is not.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   [laughter]
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Or a soluble version of the iPhone.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   But you're right.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   I mean, the fact that they've managed they got Apple to move one inch on anything just gives you an idea of the power that Walmart has.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And also, I suppose the power that Apple has.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   That's Apple, right.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   The number of bums and seats that Apple can fill.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   You can see that Walmart still.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   I mean, Walmart, yeah, it just literally just wants to have access to that market.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   So it's a very, very interesting thing.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Now, if you have your iPhone and you're using iTunes, you've got to be careful about using it in New York.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Have you seen the new iTunes tax?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Oh.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Oh.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   That's all.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Now, first of all, New York started with the...
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   They started with the quote unquote Amazon tax.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   And the bottom line is all these states include a New York or running out of money and they're looking for every rock that they can look under to get a little bit more.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And first, they found that they could...
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Amazon's resisting it, but they found that they're going to start charging taxes for anything that you buy on Amazon because of the local vendors.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Now they're going to be adding the iTunes tax, which is basically they're going to start...
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   It's not going to be 99 cents anymore if they get their way.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Well, most states have what's called an excise tax.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   And for instance, I live in Washington state.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   We're adjacent to Oregon where there's no sales tax.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   So people who live in southern Washington, i.e. Vancouver, Washington, can literally drive across a bridge.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And by an Apple computer, less the 9% Washington sales tax, which amounts to about the same savings you get if you're a preferred business account with Apple.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   So they do that.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   But legally, when they pay their taxes, they're supposed to declare that they bought that computer and submit to the state of Washington the equivalent tax.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Of course, nobody does it.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I was about to say, I'm surprised they don't just come back and just say that they bought this in Oregon.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Well, the thing is, if you do buy it in Oregon, you don't pay Oregon sales tax, but the point is that...
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   You're supposed to pay it in Washington.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   If you were audited in Washington and they found a receipt from an Oregon store, they'd say, "Did you declare this in your excise tax? If not, you owe us money."
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   So all these states have always had some way to try to tax these things that are non-taxable, but most of them are unenforceable.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   New York's attempt is to simply move that into an enforceable realm.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And as you said, Alex, they're all hard up for money, but I wish they'd just get it the good old-fashioned way, get crooked cops to sit behind billboards and take it to go for going 56 and 55.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   I know, I know, just sort of out.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I don't really drive that much, so I think that would be a great idea.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   So the last thing, the last thing, this is not really Mac as much as just general mobile computing.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Have you seen the 512 gigabyte notebook SSDs?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   I'm very excited about these.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Read speeds of 240 megabytes, not megabits a second.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And write speeds of 200 megabytes a second.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   We have to line up a lot of raids to get that kind of speed.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And we're right around the corner from having those in our notebooks.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   It's going to be very exciting.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   So now we have our picks for the week coming up here.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   But first, of course, we have to thank our sponsoraudible.com.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And, you know, of course, you can get a free book.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   If you're new to Audible, you can get a free book at audible.com/macbreak.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   And of course, we have Andy here, so we have to ask Andy, can you give us a recommendation?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Yes.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   The book that I'm going through right now is by Michael Palin.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   It's around the world in 80 days.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   It is Michael Palin as you know from some of the picks I've made.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   He's really made quite a transformation of himself, hasn't he?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Really all the pythons have.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   You look at what they're doing today and they're not just, well, apart from Eric Eidel, basically
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   recycling every money pythons get into Spannalot, but doing it very, very well.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   They're not just, you know, living off their laurels from Python.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   They've all moved on into really wonderful new things.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   One of the things that Michael Palin does is he does these really brilliant travel
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   documentaries for the BBC.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   One of the very first ones he did was around the world in 80 days.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   This is back in 1988 when he tried to reproduce the feat of traveling around the world in
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.240]   80 days, it was like in the Jules Verne book, only of course, you know, using the same rules
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.000]   where you cannot use any air transportation.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   How is that made different nowadays?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.120]   It's actually a much bigger challenge than it was in Jules Verne's day because there is
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.600]   no regular passenger service across the ocean.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:39.200]   There is no regular, the rail service across China and across other parts of the country,
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.640]   the nations are just hopeless.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.400]   And now that they're parts of the Middle East where you really can't, you can't even
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.600]   drive across it without getting a lot of paperwork with a lot of fancy stamps put on them.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:57.280]   So Palin is on top of everything else an obsessive diarist ever since one of our previous picks
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:04.960]   was the Python diaries where it's just reproducing his nightly diary from 1970 through 1980.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:10.080]   And so he of course kept a daily diary of his travels and this is the audio version of
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.960]   his trip.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.480]   It's quite an adventure.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.520]   It's one of those nonfiction narratives that I like and that it has a clear beginning,
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.840]   middle, and at end, and a little bit of tension as you're trying to figure out, gee, he's
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.360]   now on a train, he's now in the United States finally where you can just simply board a
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.400]   train that will take you from the west coast to the east coast.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.880]   But now he's trying to figure out, does he have time to stop off in Colorado to have
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   fun for a day?
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.720]   And he's like, but oh, God, you got you got to be a Newark because this container ship
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.360]   is going to leave on this day to maybe take you across the ocean.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   If you miss this, this connection, you will not make it in 80 days.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.360]   But it's more than that.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:51.720]   It's all kinds of really wonderful local observations about, you know, he had the full
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.480]   backing of the BBC because this was for BBC documentary.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.120]   So of course, he had an immense number of resources, but they always found whatever solutions they
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.160]   could find on the day when he happened to turn up.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.880]   When a certain schedule fell apart or a certain ship had to leave without him, he wound up
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:14.600]   crossing the Arabian Sea, I believe, on a dial, basically on a big shipment of nuts,
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:20.680]   water, these little, like, sort of like four panels, the boating equivalent of a four panel
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:28.320]   truck, just one day, one week with just interacting with the crew, having no time to do anything
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.520]   but do nothing.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.800]   It's quite good.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.960]   It's eight hours long.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:39.720]   And at this point, he is about to see if his stopover in Colorado has caused him to miss
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.960]   his connection across the Atlantic.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.080]   That's where I am right now, or at least that's where I was this morning when I drove
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.520]   around a little bit.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.480]   But it's really, really excellent stuff.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.920]   And also, he's a hell of a narrator, and he's narrating his own stuff here.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   Excellent.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.080]   Oh, yeah, just listening to him talk about it is great.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.680]   I mean, you hear that on the show.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.840]   And I know that's inspired me.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.000]   His shows on the BBC of the ones I've seen, and I don't know who carries them in the United
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.440]   States, but I've seen a couple of them.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:11.120]   And it inspires me to start taking more train trips, you know, to be able to actually see
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.120]   things.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:17.720]   And I know that doing that here in Japan was awesome because you're coming home and we
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.960]   just decided to get off at a stop and wander around.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.800]   And it's much more difficult to do that on the plane.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.600]   Actually, just talk about Michael Peland, just to keep an eye open, there's a new, he's
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.480]   actually done a new documentary, I think, for this season.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.280]   But he's gone back to some of the old places he visited.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.240]   Really, just to meet the people that he met.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.080]   And I think that's coming out at Christmas time over here in the UK.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   So you'll probably get that.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.880]   So we'll get it sometime in 2010.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.360]   Well, there is.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.280]   Now, the good news is that there is a new Mac player for the BBC that's in beta right
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   now.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   So that was announced.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   Yes, that's right.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.280]   That's right.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.280]   Yes.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   Actually downloaded.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.280]   It's actually built on Adobe Air.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.040]   But it does allow you because we've been able to stream OK, but this now allows you to
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   download.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   Hey, it works OK.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   Yeah, but it works pretty well.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:09.520]   So it's a step forward for the stuff that we can get on the outside of out of the UK,
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.000]   because of course, a lot of the programming has to stay in Britain, right?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Or in the UK in general.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.480]   Yeah, I think they are making a play though for, you know, and they will sort of spread
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.480]   out into it.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:27.000]   I think the BBC Worldwide part of the organization is probably the, as you know, the BBC is
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.880]   actually supported by UK license payers rather.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.320]   And the BBC Worldwide organization actually does turn in a profit.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:42.760]   And they are looking to expand the global empire into well all over the world with documentaries
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   etc.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.040]   But I think it's down to licensing and copyright at the minute, the usual.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.480]   And now that we've gone down the BBC, Radhol will come back just one second and just remind
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:58.320]   him that if you listen to our little rant about a great book, if you want to get around
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.880]   the world in 80 days, audible.com/macbreak and you can get it for free.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.520]   So if you're new to Mac to audible, you just got to get over there.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.440]   So audible.com/macbreak, check it out.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.440]   And now it is time for the pick of the week.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.160]   Scott, do you have a pick of the week?
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.480]   Excuse me, I do.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.480]   And it's free.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   Free.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.680]   I'm going to pause for effect here as the shock and awe of that statement settles in
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.160]   with the crowd.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   This is not a $700 pick for me.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   This is not an Alex.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.360]   This is a zero Alex.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   It's animoto.com.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.280]   A-N-I-M-O-T-O.com.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:43.960]   And what they do is they let you upload pictures, JPEGs, and then they analyze the images and
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.440]   they give you several musical choices you can pick.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:53.400]   And then they sort of somehow through magic and voodoo, conform the images so that they
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:59.120]   work within the beats of the music and create a custom video for you that you can then share
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.680]   with folks absolutely free of charge.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.840]   Wow, that's great.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.360]   And they're darn good.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.640]   Now they do have a paid service.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   That's the gotcha.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.440]   If you want to get DVD quality, you have to pay a yearly fee and our monthly fee, I believe.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:21.480]   And you can subscribe and then download those DVD quality videos and share them with people.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.800]   That part of the service provides very high quality.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.000]   My only dig on it is that they stick their logo on the end of it even after you pay for
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   it.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   That's not my favorite part of it.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.960]   The free one, no reason not to play with that.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:39.120]   And if you're just tired of boring slideshows that look the same every time you do an iPhoto
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.680]   or other slideshows and if they all look the same with the Ken Burns effect and yada yada.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:51.840]   This is much more MTV style and Alex, you'll be interested to know that a lot of the folks
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.640]   involved in this have broadcast movie and television experience.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.480]   That sounds like a lot of fun.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.280]   So animoto-animoto.com.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   Yep.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.200]   Andy, Andy, what's your pick of the week?
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:10.920]   My pick of the week is something that you should not buy now, but you should wait until
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.440]   January 1st.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:22.360]   There is a maker of really great display fonts and other types of types of fonts called comicbookfons.com.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.120]   They're called comic craft, but the URL is comicbookfons.com.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.880]   And if you start looking through the fonts that they have available, you just click that
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:37.120]   add to cart button just by fast twitch nerve response because some of the most beautiful
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.120]   gorgeous.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.040]   If you're designing websites, it's like, oh, that's why my website looks so absolutely
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.840]   not really good because I have sucky fonts.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:52.160]   If you do a lot of presentations, all my presentations use comicbookfons.com fonts.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.800]   I don't know if that says something about my presentation skills that more than once I
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.160]   have gotten a question during the Q&A.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   Wow.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.880]   Where did you get your font?
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.880]   Dude.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.680]   Oh, these are awesome.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.720]   Usually it's like, wow, it's the font that you were using.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.920]   It's like comic, it's like comic sans only.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   It doesn't suck.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   How did you do that?
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.920]   Right.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.920]   Just time and time again.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.840]   I have so many comicbookfons.com fonts in my fonts folder.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:23.280]   And the reason why is because every January 1st, they have a one day only sale.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   Most of these, a lot of these fonts go for a hundred bucks, two hundred bucks, three
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.480]   hundred bucks, thirty bucks all over the price range, but really, really expensive.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.960]   For one day only, it is the year in cents.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:40.000]   So if this year is just like every other year, for one day only, every font in the catalog
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.200]   will be $20.09.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.720]   Every year I wind up getting $1,000, $1,500 for the fonts for a hundred bucks flat.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.240]   But of course, I never do it all at once.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.880]   It's always, okay, I've just spent 60 bucks, but that's all I want.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.880]   Right.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.880]   You know what?
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.840]   I think I will get the Brian Talbot font.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.280]   Okay, I'll buy that one, but that's it.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.480]   And then two hours later, ooh, the action, the fonts and the action.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.480]   Oh, mad scientist.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.080]   Oh God, that's such a great font.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.880]   Okay, I'll just get mad scientist.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:12.520]   Well, and there's one here, Letterbot, that is, it is just like the kind of the mechanical
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:19.800]   command, you know, it says command, you know, like a graphical thing for a computer, except
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.960]   it's just a little fun.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.960]   So it's taking...
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.360]   It looks like a hand drawn version of an OCR font.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   Right.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.160]   And those of you who see my YouTube videos, my Vimeo videos, it's also known as Andy and
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.200]   Otgo's subtitle and title card font.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.280]   Because again, that's another just one, it's just such a solid font that works absolutely
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.760]   everywhere.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.520]   And I'm a biggest supporter of comic craft as there is because they do such great products.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.960]   Also, if you're into comics, you will recognize a lot of these fonts.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.480]   Well, one of their main businesses is selling fonts to professional letters and professional
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.240]   artists, some of these fonts are actually named after like Brian Talbot.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.520]   They're named after the artists who commissioned or they commissioned these fonts or they
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.240]   created them in the style of this guy's lettering because, you know, all lettering is being
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.560]   done digitally these days.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.120]   But again, you can't go anywhere with comic son.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.760]   So you'll simply say, well, why don't you...
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.920]   Here's a sample of my writing.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.480]   Please convert this into a really good professional looking font.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.480]   Yes.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   So yeah.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.800]   Do you think this deal is better than if you buy some of the packs, Andy, or is it
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.120]   better to break them down and wait for January 1st and buy individual fonts?
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   It depends.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.440]   I mean, a lot of people just aren't in the business of spending $200 for a pack of fonts,
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.720]   but $20 for one specific one that works pretty well.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.600]   And they don't do stupid things like charge you one price for the uppercase set and another
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.520]   price for a lowercase set.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.680]   Although you do have to be careful, some of these are designed to be just display fonts
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   so that you will only...
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.240]   It only is available in uppercase.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:55.840]   So if I say that anytime that I'm anywhere near January, that's my start thing about what
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   fonts I'm going to purchase.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.280]   Now if it were August and I decided that, you know what, for this, there's this new font
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.960]   called Do Hickey Lower and it's only $39 and it looks like a really...
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:11.400]   Just like you said, just sort of a more fun version of a future compressed.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.400]   I would certainly not wait until January to buy it.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.120]   But truth be told, I always overspend it.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.040]   I'm always planning on how much money I'm going to be spending on January 1st.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.560]   And I will wait a couple months because my $100 will go much, much further that way.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.840]   You get 79 fonts for a grand right now.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.040]   That's a pretty good deal.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.000]   They're legends package.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.040]   Yeah, so it'll make crap.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   Yeah, really well made fonts.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.080]   And that's something that I think is...
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.160]   It's easy to get lots of fonts that are like everybody else's.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.840]   So this is a great way to stand out.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.440]   So comicbookfants.com.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.320]   And it's the one day sale is just the day of January 1st.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.040]   Now the question is where I'm assuming in the United States.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.120]   If I tune in, I might miss it.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.120]   That's an excellent question.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.280]   Well, I'm sure you could find a font mule.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.960]   There's only to smuggle the fonts out.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:06.320]   I should mention that it's not advertised on the site right now.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.520]   They've done this every year for the past...
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.080]   You just have to know it's there.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.400]   1903, ever since they switched from hot metal, I guess.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.680]   Obviously, they want to get... I think they want to have an extra week or so
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.800]   which they're charging full price for their faces.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.880]   But if they didn't do it this year, it would be news for them.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880]   Right.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.880]   Very good.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.920]   So comicbookfants.com, January 1st, you got to be there.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.160]   Now, Don, do you have a pick for us?
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   Yeah, sure.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.880]   I'll fly the flag this week.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.680]   And I'll actually support a UK-based software house.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.840]   Don't know if you've heard of Real Mac software.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:43.040]   They do RapidWeaver, which is the template-based web creation tool.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.320]   They recently came out with another application called Little Snapper.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:52.080]   Now, this is another... What you might think is just yet another sort of screen capture
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.520]   tool, but it's actually slightly more than that.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.760]   And it's beautifully put together.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.600]   It's a gorgeous looking application.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.400]   And it allows you to, as you might expect, do screen captures or areas of the screen.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:07.560]   But it also allows you to do full web pages as well and has a library feature built in
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.080]   so that you can sort of build up a library of really cool looking websites and things
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.080]   like that.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.880]   So, you've got a lot of annotation features built in, so you can put text annotations.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.520]   You can draw on the images as well.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.280]   And on the back end, they have, I think, a quick snapper, which is a web-based image-sharing
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.840]   service, which is for you as well.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:29.020]   How does this really stand above what you already get with the Mac if you just hit Command
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.020]   Shift 4?
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.840]   Well, it's more to do with the organization.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.680]   It's got some nice features such as DOM snapping.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.240]   You know, where it's in something like ScreenFlow that you can do some magic whereby you can
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:46.040]   just capture a certain window within your video.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.640]   Well, they use a similar technique as well.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.960]   So you can actually, instead of using crosshairs and things to focus in on an area of
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.560]   the screen, you can actually go in and focus in on a window.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.800]   So that's quite nice.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.400]   But the main power is it's elegance in the way, actually, does it?
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.280]   And also it's storage capabilities as well, because it does allow you to create this library
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:07.760]   of images that you can obviously upload via FTP or upload to Flickr or upload to this
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.760]   quick snapper service, you can annotate them.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.760]   But it looks really nice.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   You can tag them as well, and you've got smart collections.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.960]   So if you want to keep a collection of all your different images, it separates out screen
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.200]   captures from web archives and stuff like that.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.400]   So it's really if you're into capturing and collecting lots of different images from all
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.240]   over the web and all over your Mac, you can put them in the single library.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.160]   I think they've just enhanced it so you can use something like Dropbox now as one of
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:34.440]   you want to have the same library on multiple Macs, you can the library is now portable.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.440]   No, it's great.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.080]   I think the annotations look great.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.080]   The annotations are really cool.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.320]   There's some really nice ones that I especially like the tech annotation whereby you can also
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.360]   create when you do a tech annotation, there's one option whereby you can create sort of
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.280]   small numerals so that it's a first of all, they created two numerals and a piece of
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   tech.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.280]   They're like, well, that's a bit of a bug.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   It's created two numerals.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.960]   Then I realized that you can actually take one of the numerals and place it on an object
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.400]   on your screen and then keep the other numerals with the text so that you can actually reference
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:04.280]   different parts of the screen and have the text box in different areas of the screen.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.320]   So it's some really nice features.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.480]   So let's buy you a little, go ahead.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   Say again.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.120]   Yeah, so that's that's little snapper.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.200]   It's not a free application.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.200]   It's actually $39.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.920]   You've got to be serious about your data.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.520]   You can download and have a look at and have a play with.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.520]   Right.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.520]   Perfect.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   And so and that is at realmaxsoftware.com.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.760]   Yeah, realmaxsoftware.com.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   That will take to the main page.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.960]   There is a slash little snapper.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:35.920]   But we lost somebody there.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.800]   And the, whoops.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.280]   Sorry about that.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.280]   No problem.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.280]   Scott fell off the mic.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.280]   Are you there, Scott?
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   Can you hear me?
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   Yep.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.280]   Yep.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.280]   Hello.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.280]   Okay.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.280]   There we go.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.680]   So my pick, I have two picks, but they're both iPhone apps.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:02.400]   I'll do them quickly because one of them is timely for while I'm here.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.400]   The first one is C-Dragon.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.960]   Have you guys seen C-Dragon?
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.160]   This is a Microsoft product.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.160]   Oh, yes.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.640]   And it's free.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.680]   And it's up on, you know, you just search the iTunes store C-Dragon.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.120]   What it does is it lets you have infinite scaling into images.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.120]   It's crazy.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   I mean a lot of the Microsoft R&D, the R&D units in Microsoft are some of the coolest
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.320]   around, especially when it comes to image processing.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:33.240]   And so they put out this thing where you look at images and you just keep on zooming in
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.440]   and zooming in and zooming in.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.440]   And it's really, it feels like, especially when you're hooked to Wi-Fi.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:44.240]   When you're hooked to 3G, it's not quite as solid.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.560]   But when you're hooked to Wi-Fi, it really just feels like you're just infinitely zooming
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.560]   into an image.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.560]   And so it's really fun.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.560]   It's a free app.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.560]   It's called C-Dragon.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.560]   Definitely check that out.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:58.760]   The other one that I wanted to point out is one that I'm using a lot.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:03.840]   I used it a lot in France, and then I used it when I was there in September.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:09.240]   And now I'm using another version of it here in Japan, and it's called lingo look.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.640]   Have you guys seen lingo look?
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.960]   Have you heard of it?
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.800]   So lingo look is a language.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.400]   It helps you with language.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.000]   And what I do is it goes on your iPhone and I can go to Essentials for instance.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.400]   And the most important one to know generally anywhere in any country is where's the restroom.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.000]   That's usually the one that I find that is important.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.360]   And so what you can do is you can sit there and click on that and it plays it back for
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   you.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.920]   So here, let me see what this will work.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.920]   What can I do?
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.680]   Did you hear that?
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   What I do is it'll play it back.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.800]   It'll play it back because my problem with dictionaries, I got other Japanese dictionary,
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.160]   which was fine for the iPhone.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   But the thing is, is that I don't know how to say it.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.880]   Like it doesn't help me to look at the text oftentimes.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.600]   I want to know exactly how I'm supposed to say it.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:04.960]   So if I want to ask someone, if I want to say thank you for instance, hold on, let me
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:12.360]   in Japanese, I can say, you know, I got to go Zaimos.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:18.320]   You know, and now you look pretty stupid if you play it for the people that you're standing
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:19.480]   in front of.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.680]   You know, although, although there was this point where I was lost and we needed something
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.960]   and I remember I just pushed the button and played it.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.160]   And the woman goes, oh, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.640]   And so it, in a pinch, you can do it, but you look pretty geeky and pretty silly.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:36.200]   If you play it in front of them and then repeat it, people will make fun of you.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:41.760]   But what's really great on an iPhone is having this touch, this touch interface and you put
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.120]   one headphone in like it's your phone, you know, like your phone jack and you have a
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.120]   headphone in and you're sitting there waiting for something.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.480]   You're waiting in line, you're waiting for your meal, you're waiting for something and
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.200]   you just sit there and figure out what you're going to say next and you hit it.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.480]   You hit it a couple of times, you under your breath, you practice it and then you say
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.120]   it and people are so impressed with you.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.040]   My covercraft is full of eels.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.480]   Exactly.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.760]   So the lingo look and they have it in a couple of different languages.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.760]   I'm not so much sure.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.720]   I know they have it in the least French and Japanese because I have those ones.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.800]   I think they make it in German and Italian as well in Spanish.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:24.040]   And it's the best, the thing that if you're traveling to a country that speaks one of
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:28.120]   those languages and you don't speak it, on your iPhone, I think that's the best one.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.600]   And I think, and I don't know how much it is.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.400]   I think it's like 7.99 or 4.99.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:36.760]   It's not 99 cents or free, but it's definitely worth every penny.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.880]   So that's my pick for the week.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.200]   And where can people find you?
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   Don?
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.600]   Well, you can find me over at screencastsonline.com.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   Screencastsonline.com.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.040]   And this is all you do, right?
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   You're creating Mac?
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.440]   Is it all Mac based?
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.440]   It's all Mac.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.600]   Well, some web services as well.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.920]   But yeah, this is my full-time job.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:04.560]   I create a weekly video podcast and I really go through lots of the, not so much the pro
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:09.200]   apps, but the standard iLife apps, I go through third-party applications, web services.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.440]   I've just done a huge show, a 45-minute show, an omnifocus.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:18.760]   So, all the really good third-party apps I tend to cover over the course of the year.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.160]   There's a huge backlog now of over 180 screencast that I've done since I've been doing this
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   full-time.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:27.520]   So it keeps me busy and keeps me, keeps a roof of my family's head as well.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.520]   So it's great.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.520]   Very fantastic.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.520]   Scott, where can people find you?
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.280]   Well, on the Twitter, it's gotborn or just gotborn.com for links to all the various blogs,
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.120]   podcasts and things I'm involved in.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:43.480]   And then, you know, I enjoy hanging out with you occasionally on TwIP, of course.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.000]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   And Andy.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.840]   The headquarters is Andy Atko's Celestial Waste of Van With at cwob.com.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:58.240]   Or if you can type in my last name, which nobody can do, that's also the real.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.160]   That's why it's www.cwob.com.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:06.640]   Now, if you actually can do it, if they reach you by typing in your first name on the first
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.040]   try today, they win a prize.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.640]   You win a Cadillac.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.640]   A Cadillac Imperial.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   I think 63.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:15.480]   I got to pick it up from some guy off the brakes list, but it's yours.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.480]   You can have it.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.480]   Very good.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.240]   You need a trailer, though.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.720]   All right.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.760]   Until next week, Leo will be back next week.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.000]   Until then, another Mac break is broke.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   [MUSIC]
