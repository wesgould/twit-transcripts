[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Coming up on Mac Break Weekly, I'm Mike Asargent, I'm subbing in for Leo Laporte, and this week we've got a great show for you first.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.380]   We kick things off with Jason Snell's review of the M2 MacBook Air.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.040]   That's right, he's got it in hand, and he's ready to talk about it.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.720]   What's good, what's great, and what could use work?
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.220]   We also talk about some interesting legal cases.
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:29.300]   Apple Pay is under fire, and Apple is trying to deal with the fact that some folks feel that there are some antitrust concerns
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.860]   related to Apple's grip on payment processing on iOS.
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:42.600]   Then we talk about Apple Arcade and how some games are leaving before we discuss Apple's whole slate of subscription offerings.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:52.800]   And finally, finally, some movement on that ongoing case where different purchasers of Apple's Mac computers said,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.900]   "Look, that keyboard you've been including in the laptops? Not so great, a $50 million settlement.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.300]   All that plus so much more coming up on Mac Break Weekly."
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600]   [Music]
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.500]   "Podcasts you love."
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500]   "From people you trust."
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500]   "This is Twi--"
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.100]   [Music]

[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   Leo Laport is still cruising USA.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.900]   I don't know, cruising Alaska.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:37.900]   But I, Mike Asargent, am here with you today to talk about all things Mac and Apple with some of the greatest gents out there.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.900]   Joining us from just down up the highway, down the highway.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.600]   Yes, it's Jason Snell of 6Colors.com.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.400]   Hi, Jason.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   Hi, Mike.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.100]   Good to be back.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.600]   I guess now it's official that I'm going to be on this show because one week, you know, I'm just a guest two weeks.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.800]   Now I'm a regular.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.700]   He is officially a regular, also irregular, but that's, that's beside the point.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.500]   And also joining us from WGBH in Boston.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.300]   It's Andy and not go hello, Andy.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.000]   Hello, Micah.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.400]   How are you?
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.200]   I'm marinating slightly.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.800]   It's really quite unpleasant here in New England.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   I'm used to, I'm used to ducking out of the top 10 degrees of what's people are suffering in Boston because I'm close to the coast.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.600]   And right now I'm about to tell like anyone who's listening that, Hey, man, I could hear the fans on your room.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.900]   Cute.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.100]   No, the fans are staying on the fans.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.900]   I'm like, unless you want to hear the musings of heat stroke, Andy, which could be amusing as hell.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.300]   It's stroke, Andy.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.900]   I feel like there's a jingle there, but yeah, I was wondering what those sounds were now.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.400]   I know.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.500]   So now now that we've addressed it, it's fine, right?
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.000]   And also joining us perhaps with even louder fans, but he's got some special filter that's making it all go away.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.400]   It's Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.300]   How are you, Alex?
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.600]   Doing much better.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.100]   Good.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.600]   Good.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.900]   Yes.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.000]   You are you are here this week.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.600]   We we had a little dropout from you last week, but glad to have you back this week.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   And glad everything's okay.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.400]   I know everybody has a series.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.100]   It was a long trip and it was long COVID train started started on the day during the show and we were talking before the show.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.900]   It was, you know, I told the COVID train, Hey, can you wait for me?
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.200]   And it said, I need you to get out right now.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.400]   So so anyway, so sorry for disappearing, but I thought you guys handled it quite well from what I could hear as I laid down.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.100]   So, but yeah, doing doing much better now.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.100]   Good.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.400]   Good.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.300]   Glad to have you back.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.800]   So let's kick things off.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.600]   I have to say, I was very excited this morning.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.700]   I woke up and I looked at my phone and there were two things I was looking for.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:54.100]   One was a notification from my doctor for the results of my COVID test to make sure that I didn't have it.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.600]   And I was negative for COVID and the two variants of flu that they're testing for now.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.800]   So yeah, that was exciting.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   But what I wasn't expecting, but that I did get was a notification from FedEx saying that a package from Apple was on its way a package.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.800]   I wasn't expecting to get until mid August is now coming this coming Tuesday, not today, but this next Tuesday.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.400]   And that is an M2 MacBook Air that I thought I was going to have to wait a lot longer for.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:30.000]   But some folks, Jason's included, have an early look at the MacBook Air and have done a review.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.300]   So tell us, Jason, what's your thoughts on the new new M2 MacBook Air?
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.700]   Micah, is this your card?
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.100]   Oh my God, how did you guess?
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.300]   I guess it was a M2 MacBook Air.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.900]   It's here for some people, mostly based configurations.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.000]   But yeah, it sounds like they're starting to ship to everybody else.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.800]   I got mine a couple of weeks ago.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.200]   Couldn't talk about it last week was not allowed.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.400]   Had to pretend I didn't have it.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.200]   But it's here now.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.300]   I've been a big fan of the MacBook Air since the early days.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.600]   I actually had that first MacBook Air that was terrible, but I loved it because it was so small.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.300]   And then fortunately, they got rid of that and replaced it with the one that we all know and love in 2010.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.000]   And it's been Apple's most popular laptop for basically the last decade.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.500]   And this is a big redesign in the sense that it's really based on that design language from the 14 and 16 inch MacBook Pros that were introduced last year.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.600]   So they've got the wedge shape is out, the little kind of curvy edges are out.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.400]   And instead, you've got this sort of flat kind of like the curves right on the edges, but otherwise perfectly flat.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:40.300]   It's got MagSafe, it's got two USB C ports and an M2 processor that we already know because it's the same one that was in that MacBook Pro that was released last month.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.800]   And yeah, it's a new it's a new era for the MacBook Air.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.300]   And I just want to point out something which is that I gave the headline a new era and spelled it out.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:07:01.900]   I noticed that the Virgis story about it was also headlined a new era, but they decided to say I R dash A because they didn't trust their readers to get it.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.400]   No, I trust my readers to get it.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.000]   Thank you for not having contempt for your readers.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.200]   So I have to say I was kind of surprised.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:19.400]   So I got the midnight version and I got the one with eight core CPU, 10 core GPU, 16 gigs of RAM and a terabyte of storage.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.000]   So I thought I'm going to have to wait and that's fine.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.200]   So I was just I was shook and shocked when I saw that it's supposed to be coming this next week.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:40.600]   I know that lots of base configuration models were shipping on time or arriving on time, but have any of you seen any other folks talking about how theirs that was originally pushed further out or coming sooner?
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.100]   Was this just kind of a fluke for me?
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.100]   I've heard that the 16 with terabyte is actually like a secret.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:55.000]   They seem to have built a bunch of those because I've heard a bunch of those stock in Apple stores too.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.300]   And that's the attempt for those of you who really are desperate to get your hand on this laptop or maybe some other Apple product when it comes out.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:07.000]   They reserve an amount of them and put them in stores that are not available.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.400]   So you might think, well, it's it's back ordered for a month.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.200]   So I'm not going to be able to get my hands on it.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.300]   I place that online order.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:20.100]   Now I wait, well, you can cancel that online order if you need to because you should check with your local store or maybe go to your local store.
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.100]   They often have stock.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:32.400]   And one of the things I've heard is that that one terabyte storage model with the 16 gigs of RAM is also something that has been cropping up in Apple stores.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.800]   Mm.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   That is a good tip.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   That's a really good tip.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   So tell us about.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   Oh, yeah, I definitely picked up a couple things first thing in the morning.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.200]   And also, like you just get there right as it opens.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.100]   And oftentimes they have three, four of them of many things that are oftentimes sold out.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.100]   They kind of seed those out.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:58.600]   It's also useful to be a I've learned over time that back when I had a we're buying lots and lots of computers that being a business user is useful.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.500]   You should do it if you if you have a business sign up build a relationship.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:09.500]   Yeah, because they have a business rep at the Apple store and they will talk to you and they will reserve things for you and help you.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.100]   Exactly.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.000]   You'll be like, it's quite nice.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.500]   Tomorrow would be great if you came in and be great to visit here.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.000]   I've got a bag with my from when I got the my last MacBook Pro.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.400]   Well, when Twit got the last MacBook Pro, there's still a bag that I have that has my name on like a label on the side whenever I walked in.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:36.500]   They're like, Oh, not only did they help me out, but they were also like we had your shows on today, which was just a really kind of fun thing.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:56.100]   But I'm curious, how do you approach Jason or how did you approach the review for this specific MacBook Air and was it for you a comparison to that MacBook Pro that people seem to be kind of confused about that just came out or were you really looking at it as an iteration on the MacBook Air itself?
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.100]   Or did you answer some of those questions like, should I get this or should I get the MacBook Pro?
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   I think the most important context is to compare it to the MacBook Airs of old, not only the M1, which is sort of the, you know, the last of that other era, but also of Intel MacBook Airs because the truth is most people updating to this computer are not coming from an M1 Air.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.300]   They're coming from an Intel MacBook Air probably.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.700]   And so I tried to think about that.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.300]   I got this.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:30.500]   I was actually on vacation when this came in, which was weird because Apple is very secretive about sending you review units and I had to be like, you need to send this to a condo.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:38.500]   That is a Verbo in San Diego and I've never been there before, but here's the address and it should work and it all worked fine.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.100]   But I ended up with two MacBook Airs.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.800]   I ended up with my MacBook Air and this MacBook Air.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:54.400]   And so it was kind of great because I was on vacation and so I had a laptop in the condo and I was checking email and writing stuff and I was doing, you know, whatever, like not working because I was on vacation.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.200]   But I got to travel with it, which I thought was actually that's good, right?
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.300]   Like that's a part of the point of doing a laptop.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:11.400]   And then in my approach, yeah, I mean, the truth is what we learned about the M1 is true of the M2, which is these chips are what they are and you can put them in different wrappers and the performance.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:20.700]   If you do benchmark testing is largely identical because, you know, an M1 Air and an M1 Mini and an M1 13 inch MacBook Pro and an M1 iMac, they're all the same.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.600]   They all get the same scores more or less.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.300]   So I tried to focus on the MacBook Air experience and also think a little bit about coming from Intel.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:45.400]   My wife has a 2018 Intel MacBook Air that is probably won't have very much longer and it is startling how much you forget if you've been living on an M1 MacBook Air for a while, how slow in comparison those Intel MacBook Airs were.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.300]   And that's just a function of the Apple Silicon transition more than anything else.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:12:00.800]   And yeah, the M2 is faster than M1. There's no doubt about it and the design is really nice and having MagSafe come back and not just because it's MagSafe and all the benefits of that, but having that extra port now.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:08.300]   My M1 Air has that little, little deal that you stick into the USB-C port that gives it fake MagSafe.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.800]   And that's great, but that means I have one port.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   So having two usable ports is also a big part of this.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   But yeah, in the end for me was mostly about what's the MacBook Air experience like because I think that not only is it the most popular laptop, but that's the context most people are considering when they're buying this thing or thinking about buying it.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.300]   Absolutely.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.800]   And I mean, that's kind of been one of the ongoing questions.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   I know Leo has talked a lot about how the sort of single core performance of all of the M1 series devices is very similar.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   The single core performance of these ones are likely to be very similar.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   And it's only in multi-core performance things.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   And so when you look at like the MacBook Air, which is this device that in theory is meant for browsing the web and doing some writing tasks and that kind of thing, then we don't necessarily look at that performance boost as part of it, which I think is part of the reason why it doesn't have that active cooling system, right?
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   But at the same time I've seen folks talk about how they, you know, threw a bunch of tasks at it, opened up a bunch of tabs, tried to do these little things.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   They couldn't get it to slow down.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   And it's fascinating to me what Apple Silicon has done in terms of changing the way that folks are kind of looking at these devices and trying to turn them into these productivity machines to an extra extent.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   I'm so confused, or not confused, but rather I'm so fascinated by how now they get a MacBook Air and they're trying to push it as hard as they can, even though this device maybe in years before was not meant that way.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   I mean, is that, do we feel like that is because of the performance gains we've got from Apple Silicon itself, or is it just something that maybe I hadn't noticed before?
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   I mean, anything you want to get up on this, it's the bar being raised over time, right? Like it used to be like, oh, well, we're processing.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   But as computers have advanced in the power of Apple Silicon, that bar keeps getting raised.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   So now as a reviewer, I look at it and I say, oh, you know, you might not want to do 8K renders on this for an hour because it'll slow down.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   It'll still do it. It'll just be a little bit slower.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   And it's like 8K renders, right? Like the bar has been raised a lot over time.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   And the truth is 99.9% of people who buy the MacBook Air will never get it to throttle even.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   It will maybe get a little warm maybe, and that's about it.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   I think that our expectations grow. It's like a bag.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   You know, our expectations will grow with a matter of how fast you make the process.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   And we're going to go, well, it's pretty good.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   You know, like it was it could have done this better. It could have rendered 8K or I could have been able to render, you know, whatever those things are.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.800]   But I will say that it's just incredible. Like these, these, these, all the M1s.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   I mean, I have, I'm not traveling as much. So I have a lot of the M1 minis.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   And I'm just, oh, I'm still taken aback by how fast they are, you know, and, and that they just jumped so much forward.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   And then obviously the studio has been great as well.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   You know, we've done some pretty extensive tests with the studio with video and it's just, you just keep on adding more outputs.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.800]   And you're like, it's going to slow down eventually.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   Maybe that just points out with the, I agree absolutely with Jason saying, I mean, when you're reviewing these things, it's hard to come up with a real real scenario in which you can say, oh, geez, that's too bad.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   Because even stacked up next to like mid range, big, like eight fan helicopter cooling style windows laptops.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   This thing is just thrashing, thrashing in the benchmarks and another hands on actual tests.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   But the thing is like when you're, the Apple's only, Apple's problem is that they don't charge, they don't, they don't, they're not really good at giving you a really, really great deal.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   You know, like, like if this were an $800 laptop, we could possibly be reviewing things and send some file, but you know what?
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.800]   What are you going to get? What do you, let's not expect too much because this is an $800 laptop.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   These are great benchmarks. It is appropriate to see, well, let's see what it takes to really make these things suffer and scream because look for, a lot of these pillars, I was spending $1,500, $2,000, $3,000 on a MacBook Air.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   And for that amount of money, even at the lower end, they have a right to expect like the best possible upgrade they could possibly get over whatever they were using before.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   I think that's a great point to the idea that the, we could be cynical about the fact that this is $11.99 and that the last year's model, essentially the M1 Air is still on a price list at $9.99.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   But I think the other way to view it, and Andy, you were kind of getting at it there too, is that that M1 MacBook Air is great, right?
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   And like, although I wish that this M2 Air was $9.99, it's not for various reasons.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   I think they are going to need to get it there eventually. But I'm so glad that that $9.99 price point is still there.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   And the fact is Apple Silicon was such a leap that even if you end up, I think it's a legitimate buy, a good buy to buy the M1 MacBook Air even today, if you are looking at the prices and going, "Oh, it's a little too rich for my blood," because at $9.99, that M1 Air is still going to do 99.9% of the jobs that you ever wanted as fast as you could possibly want them.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   Yeah, another response with a lot of nines in it.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   I think that it's really, really important that Apple hold that line and make sure there's always a MacBook available for less than $1,000, even if it's $1 less, because that also means that education prices is probably going to be $100 less.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   And there's so many people for whom that $100 or that $200 difference between the M1 and the M2 is going to be the difference between having a Mac and having a Windows machine.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   And most of those people would probably rather have a Mac, wouldn't they?
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   What is it outside of the processor that brings this over that $9.99 price bump?
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   What else do they do with the M2 over the M1 to really raise that price, do we think?
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   I think it's not the processor so much as it is.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   I mean, the display is new, the webcam is upgraded, it's that notch display, which is not as good a display as this MacBook Pro is that cost $2,000, but it's brighter and it's taller and it's got, yes, it's got the notch, but you know, Apple's been very clever about hiding the menu bar in the notch.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   And I think that for most people, the menu bar being up there, it isn't that disruptive and you get used to it and it's fine.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   So it's a better display, it's a better webcam, it's a 1080 webcam, you've got MagSafe.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   This new design probably is a little more expensive than the old design too in terms of the physical enclosure of it.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   I'm sure it's one of those things where they looked at the cost of making this right now and weren't comfortable taking it to $9.99 and thought, like I just said, that the M1 Air is actually pretty great, so why don't we keep selling it?
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   But I do think that over time they need to push it down because, like Andy said, it's the truth of it, it's the reality of it.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   There's a reason Apple tried to get rid of the MacBook Air a few years ago and replace it with the MacBook and the 13-inch MacBook Pro, both of which were $11.99 or $12.99.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   And they were retina and the MacBook Air wasn't and people didn't care, they just kept buying the $9.99 laptop.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   And I think Apple's learned that lesson that for a lot of people, the $9.99 laptop is what they're going to buy.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   And that's it, you can try to sell me an $11.99 laptop, but there's a certain portion of the consumer base that's just going to say no.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   So that's why I think in the long run the M2 Air will need to get down there.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   And I know there's inflation and stuff like that, but having that $99 price point, a lot of nines, like Andy said, I think is important.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   And I don't, I really wonder what the, they'll never say, but what the sales proportion will be between the M1 and the M2 over the next year.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   Because I think they're still going to sell a lot of M1 Airs and they should. It's a great computer.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   I will say that Apple is starting to, it feels like there's a trajectory that looks a lot like the early 90s,
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   where there are so many different chips and so many different computers that are being released and they're all in different cadences that even for someone like me, I start going, I don't know what I want to buy.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   You know, like, you know, I think it was clear for a while and I think it's starting to get murky.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   And I think that it's not murky yet, but I think that Apple has to start thinking about, you know, the streamlining that a little bit.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   It probably has to do with supply chains and lots of other things of putting out what you can when you can.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   But with lots of different chip sets that are not as far apart with lots of different outlays, it just gets, it starts to get confusing.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   And it was like, it was not that there was, didn't need to be, I don't know, six versions of the Mac when, you know, there was, they're almost identical in the early 90s.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   But I start feeling a little deja vu that we're starting to get a lot of product, different pieces of hardware at different levels of development.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   And it's starting to lead to, I think, people I've talked to are starting to get like they're just hanging on and not buying anything right now because they're not sure what the next thing is for them.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   Because it's just so many different options and they're so fine of detail between them that it really takes a lot of thought.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   And something that Apple's been good at not forcing us to do for a long time, but it seems to be getting harder.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   All right, folks, we're going to take a quick break before we come back with more Mac Break Weekly with Andy Anotko, Alex Lindsey and Jason Snell.

[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   And hey, you can have that today. Thanks so much to Nouve for sponsoring this week's episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   Back from the break, and now let's talk about an interesting report.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   First and foremost, we saw, I can't remember if it was Facebook or Google first, but one of those two companies, whether they said it themselves or it was leaked or however it went,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   those two companies announced that things were going to be slowing down, that they weren't going to be doing a lot of hiring, that they were going to be pulling back on spending, that was going to be a rough couple of years, etc.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   And now, according to Bloomberg, Apple is joining that list of companies who are reportedly planning to slow down spending on "some teams" next year.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   The outward understanding of this is that the potential economic downturn is at the root of wanting to slow things down.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   But I have to ask Jason, you've got charts on charts on charts that always seem to be showing Apple's money growing and growing and growing.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   Why does a company this big with this much money need to slow down hiring and change focus on this team?
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   I know you're not an economist by trade, but I am curious your thoughts on this.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   Why do they don't? That's the thing.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   And in fact, I find it baffling when these stories come out because Apple has always been the company that says you invest through a downturn.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   We have all the money, we have all the money in the bank, we make a huge amount of money.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   When everybody else is shrinking, that's when we put more money in, right? Because then when it turns back around, you're ahead.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   That's an investing thing, it's a business thing. And I think Apple mostly does that.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   So I look at this and I think, one, maybe this is a message Apple is trying to send to Wall Street, which is we're taking it seriously.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   And we are concerned that this is going to be an issue.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   And also, anything that's an important category for Apple, they are absolutely not doing this, right?
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   Like anything that's important, they're not doing this.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   So what is it? My gut feeling is it's either an excuse to cut in places or reduce through attrition, places where they are not that particularly enthusiastic or they think there are too many people.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   Or it's just, I don't even know.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   I find it ridiculous to suppose that Apple somehow needs to limit its hiring in certain areas because it's worried about a...
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   Unless they are worried about a decades-long depression or something like that.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   Like they got all the money, they're going to come out of this.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.800]   The last thing they want to do is reduce the amount of fuel going to the engine.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   So I'm skeptical that this is not something that is not what it appears to be, if that makes sense, like in some sort of ulterior motive, whether it's external or internal.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   I think that Apple still run by folks that came from a downturn.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   I think that there's a PTSD that exists at Apple related to the '90s that they have never really gotten out of.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   And I think that any time they see any issue at all, I think that they go, "Oh, well, we're going to have to pull back a little bit."
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   And they've made these announcements in the past.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:52.800]   I think that we're talking about them, they're still talking about not even necessarily cutting jobs, but simply slowing down.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   And I think that they very quickly get to prioritize, we're just going to prioritize what matters.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   And I think Apple's better at this than most companies, which is not...
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   We're just going to prioritize the things that probably make money for the next.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   And that's kind of their signal that we're going to focus on those things.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   And again, I think that if any company, they are the worst-case scenario, a lot of things, how bad can this be and what can it look like?
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   And I think that they will tend to pull back faster than almost anyone else as far as wanting to be careful because they're...
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.800]   Again, I think it comes from the '90s.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   And it literally isn't something that's right now.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   You have still people making decisions who live through something that was pretty harrowing, and if they see anything that they might want to start hedging for, they'd rather hedge very slowly than hedge hard.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:50.800]   Yeah, this is probably similar to what the news came out from Google last week.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   The Google News was a little bit more precise because it came in the form of an actual company-wide email that Sundar Patry sent out.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   That said that, "No, we're not going to be firing people. As a matter of fact, we just finished a huge round of our usual snapping up people who just graduated from college, but we're going to be slowing down hiring for the rest of the rear."
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   And we're going to be specifically slightly chilling news for people who might be working on, I don't know, Google-like balloon Internet projects was that we might be...
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   We're going to be refocusing attention on things that are kind of key things and maybe consolidating certain groups together.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   And so I think that something similar but maybe a little less dramatic is going on in Apple.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   They didn't become a $2 trillion company by saying, "You know what? We don't have any need for these 800 people."
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   "We don't know what we're going to do with them and we're going to be economic downturn, but what the hell? We're going to...
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   We're Apple. We can hire as many people as we want."
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   So yeah, this is not going to affect the AR headset. This is not going to affect the Mac Pro.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   This is not going to affect anything that was already on the rails ready to go.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   The indirect news that we got specifically said that this is not going to affect any shipments or any projects that are already on the rails and ready to go.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   For a company that will throw millions of dollars at a car project that may never see the light of day,
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   something Alex said is absolutely true. I don't know how much of it is the PTSD from the 90s, but I will say there is that.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   And also, I think there is a general frugality and a carefulness when hiring that comes from that era that still exists.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   And it is, again, a company that can spend all this money on this car project that may never work just as one example.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   And yet, there are places within Apple where you would be surprised at how cheap they are and how reluctant they are to spend money.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   And I always found that weird, but I guess the argument there is if you let that go, it will get out of control like it did at Apple in the 90s, where it literally, I mean, they were bankrupting themselves because they said yes to everything.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   And they gave away a lot of computers. We'll just forget about them.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   Yeah. I think there was a lot of, we had Lucasfilm, I think we had a bunch of computers that they would drop off and say, okay, it's great.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   And I don't think that there was no paperwork for them. I mean, it was like it was just there, you know, and so, so I think that there was definitely after Steve came back, there was definitely a tightening, a dramatic tightening that happened.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   And sometimes they can shoot themselves in the foot with frugality.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   How many times have we been kind of surprised by the fact that, why is this bug still here or why has this seemingly important part of Mac OS or iOS haven't been fixed or this feature hasn't been added?
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   Oh, because we don't have enough people on staff. Why don't have people on staff?
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   Well, because we pull people off of those teams to put them on this other team because another team was behind.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   And this is where most of us would shrug and think and say, you're a $2 trillion company.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   If you've had a proven to yourself that deadlines are in jeopardy because you don't have enough people working on the project, hire more people for the project.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   Don't make it that much later to fix this part of the UI that's been driving everybody nuts for the past two releases.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   Yeah, I mean, I guess, ultimately, this made me a little nervous because all of these companies are preparing for the potential economic downturn.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   So I guess now is a good time to mention ClubTwit, Twit.tv/ClubTwit, where you can support these shows directly to make sure that they continue to come out even in times of economic uncertainty.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   And we appreciate all of you who are members of ClubTwit, who are helping to support the shows.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   Up next, let's talk about an interesting new lawsuit that is hit.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   This is an interesting one because of the people who are involved.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   So Apple has faced some scrutiny in the past over Apple Pay and the use of the NFC chip inside of the iPhone.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   In the very first iteration when the NFC chip got added for the purpose of using Apple Pay, there was lots of griping about the fact that no one was able to use the NFC scanning technology in the iPhone except for Apple through the use of Apple Pay.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   And then it kind of grew from there where there are now companies who are saying that Apple essentially holds a monopoly on iPhone and other platforms because you have to use Apple Pay instead of being able to sort of directly integrate with a specific payment system.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   And now in the United States, a law group, I guess, that has actually been responsible for two other antitrust cases brought against Apple that one is bringing a case against Apple in relation to Apple Pay.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   It's a class action suit that was struck up by a company and I'm losing it, but I think it was a company and I...
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.800]   Yeah, thank you. A Finity Credit Union.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   Yeah, and now we're looking at this case and I'm, of course, would love to hear your folks' thoughts on this and sort of what...
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   When I think of Apple Pay and I think of the benefits I get from Apple Pay as a user, I am very happy with the security of it and the convenience of it, but I'm sure as a provider of payments, having to pay those fees is not a good thing.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   Pay those fees is not something people much like to do or companies much like to do.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   Yeah, I'm really interested to see if Apple just basically cuts a deal to make this go away.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   They recently had... I can't remember how recently it was, but fairly recently they decided just to write a check for 100 million to settle a similar suit with developers, a similar class action antitrust suit.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   They're also facing new action from the British on similar antitrust actions on these fees.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   I really think that there are only two real antitrust pain points that are vulnerabilities or thermal exhaust ports, so to speak, on the Apple Spaceship.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   And it really is exclusivity over the App Store and exclusivity over payments and transactions.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   Those are the only places where Apple seems to be vulnerable and they do seem to be more vulnerable on the second.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:24.800]   Then on the first, because for many international guidelines on how you prove antitrust, Apple basically saying that, nope, we have our own payment platform.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   Nope, we're going to give our own payment platform hardware level priorities over every other competing platform.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   Yes, there are two or three or four competing payment systems that are out there.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   We are not going to let them have the same kind of power and the same kind of simplicity that ours have.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   You're never going to be able to get Samsung Pay on your Apple Watch.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   And I think that most people would agree who have used both all of these things that that's not a bad thing that you're keeping at Samsung Pay off the Apple Watch,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   but a court might have different ideas for it in an antitrust.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   If they can just simply write a check, be done with it, and be ready to fight the fight, the really big wars that are coming up very, very soon from the actual government actions,
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   then that's probably the smart thing for them to do at this point.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   You know, Apple is good at a few things. Apple is good at making lots of money, and Apple is also good at focusing on customer experience.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   And there are times when those two things are in opposition, and there are times when those two things are perfectly aligned.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   And this is a case where they're perfectly aligned, where if they had come up with an NFC payment system and it was an open API and every app was different and you had to launch a specific app in order to pay and all of that,
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   it would have been a worse user experience. I really believe unifying it under Apple Pay was the right decision.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   But also a side effect of that decision is that Apple is saying, well, we built this feature of financial institutions, and now you need to cut us in for some of that money,
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   because that's why we built this feature. And like, it's funny because it's not, it's anti-competitive sort of in a way.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   But really what we're talking about is financial institutions who benefit from the frictionless aspect of contactless payments, cutting in the company that builds the hardware and built the software to make it as frictionless as possible.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   And I kind of don't have a lot of sympathy for them, but I have a little, like I understand it, and having it be open and letting them do what they want.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   Like, I get why they want that, and yet at the same time, if they had gotten that, it would be worse.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   And that's the struggle I have with a lot of this is sometimes the user experience is degraded because Apple wants to make money.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   And that's things like not letting you buy Kindle books inside iOS, but buying iBooks.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   And that is bad. And the reason it happens is because Apple wants to skim your credit card transactions for things bought on iOS that are digital.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   I get it, I'm kind of opposed to it, but it is what it is.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   But in this case, like, Apple Pay is good. It's really good. And it would not be as good if I had to have a bunch of janky bank apps on my device instead of just putting my code numbers, you know, my card numbers in the Apple wallet set up and then forgetting about it.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   Yeah. And I think that the what starts out is freedom.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.800]   What starts out is freedom ends up being we end up as users being leveraged.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   So what will happen is, is it'll start opening up and then people will only want to let us use those things instead of using the Apple one because they don't like to make the payments or whatever.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   So as a user, we're going to end up on the tail end of this, you know, and this is a fight of these are rich banks asking for more money from a big from a very rich company.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   And the user experience will be degraded when this happens.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   You know, I'm not, you know, and the EU will do whatever because you doesn't care about American companies.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:46.800]   And so the, the, so the EU will do whatever it's going to do. But these, this, this is a bunch of rich people asking for money from a company that's bigger than them, but they want more of their little cut.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   And what it's going to mean eventually with this, the same with the app store, the same with this is that users will be forced to use certain things because they don't want to use that other thing.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   You know, and so we will be, it's, it's, it starts out looking like choice.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   But when there's not consumers in the lawsuit, just know that eventually we're going to get it in the back.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Well, I disagree with a lot of that, but we're not going to get into that right now.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   Mostly I'd like to, mostly I want to bring up that part of the problem is not just simply the, the, the correct observation that these are very, the very, very wealthy banking industry is taking on the very, very wealthy apple.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   But part of it is that you also have to ask yourself, we also have to ask ourselves as part of this conversation, what alternative payment systems that are better, that could be better than apple pay are never going to make it out of the cradle because there is no point.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   There's not going to be investment in it because the first question they're going to have is how are you going to make this easier to use than, than apple pay?
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   How are you going to get availability on the apple watch? And you will have no answer for that because apple just simply has said the apple pay is the way that this is going to go.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   We have more than half of the phones in the United States of America.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   We have a huge tick of the phones worldwide.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   If we make this decision, then suddenly this becomes a very, very impossible proposition.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   And I do think that apple could, if, if apple had no choice in the matter, if they, if there were existing laws on the books, we don't have to discuss whether this is a good idea for these laws, such a lot to exist or not.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   But let's say that it was like absolutely illegal for them to, to lock in apple watch users to just apple pay.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   I'm sure they could come up with an API that would simply that every bank would absolutely support.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   If it meant that you don't have to pop up an app in order to make to do it, you just simply, just like you can set the default browser, just like you can set a default email client, you can set a default tap to pay system.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   I'm sure they would make that happen if they had, if they had an alternative, if they had, if they had no alternative, but to support other systems.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:57.800]   And that's why I'm always very open to discussion of, well, if apple wants to, if apple wants to claim that what they're doing is not an competitive, that's great.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   We'd love to hear it in front of a court of law where other people who are not necessarily emotionally or financially invested in apple get to decide whether apple is making a good case or not.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   They should at least be forced to make that argument and not just simply say, Hey, we're apple two hippies in a garage.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   We just, we're all about user experience. We love everybody. We're the best.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   Well, do you think they won't, do you feel like they're not, it sounds like this lawsuit's happening, so they will have to do this, right?
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   Andy, I think they're going to look, well, this kind of a lawsuit is going to basically end up in some sort of a settlement.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   I don't think I don't see it going so far that if the if the if the government had, if the government were in a position to basically make this ruling, they would much rather do it themselves.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   Congress would much rather make this sort of a ruling themselves as part of a large package they would like to make after the midterms.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   But yeah, that you're right. That is, that is a risk that if apple lets this go to a certain extent, they could have a ruling on their hands.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   It will cost them a lot more than whatever check they would have to write to just make this group of banks investment companies happy and make them go away.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   I think that, I think that the issue really is, is that, you know, I'd be surprised that more than 5% of apple users want anything different.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   I just don't think it's there. And so the issue is, is that if the hard part will be, you know, for Congress or someone else to do something is that there's not a lot of voters out there interested.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   So it really comes down to paying for it.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   I really like how when I go into San Francisco around when there's like an event or something and everybody, you know, there are lots of street vendors, you see lots of folks, and then you also, you go into some coffee shops and stuff.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   And everybody's offering nine different options. They've got a tag you can scan for paying with squares cash app. They've got a tag you can scan for paying via PayPal.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   They've got one for Venmo. They've got their, their tag on the side of the thing. They've got some of them have crypto.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   All the, you know, there's so many different payment platforms out there and a lot of them are just making all of them available for use.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   I'm kind of curious what ends up being the, the main solution that a lot of people use. I think it's more varied than maybe we, we realize because when it comes to individuals or small companies versus these big companies, of course, like a grocery store
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   that's a grocery store chain can afford the infrastructure required to set up Apple Pay and all those sort of tap to pay terminals. But these smaller businesses that don't want to spend, you know, X amount of dollars a month to be able to go through square or one of those other toast or one of those are just offering payments in different ways.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   And yes, it results in some paperwork on their end, but it's interesting. I mean, they also have to look at whether they're supporting, you know, from an Apple perspective, I mean, from an Apple user perspective, I just know which vendors.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   Support Apple Pay and if they don't, then I don't go there very often. So, so the thing is, because I don't really use cash anymore and I don't, I don't really like pulling my credit card out. And so pretty much everything is all, you know, and I think that that is, you know, probably will still be the case for, for quite some time from an Apple users perspective, not necessarily.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   I mean, they can have a lot of other things, but I think most of them will have Apple Pay mostly because Apple users tend to spend more money.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   Yeah, well, just just as we're used to seeing the stickers on the windows of the store that says that you used to say, Hey, we accept MasterCard, Visa and American Express and G how come they're always printed on the same sticker.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   It's almost as if there's, as if there's no chance that they would will accept one instead of three.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   Now that sticker is, Hey, we accept Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   So I honestly have no idea when I tap my Android phone or tap a tap a watch. What, I know, I don't have to know or care what processing system the thing is using.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   It would be more interesting if I could just, just as my internet connection interface here, it basically says here are the, here's the order in which I would like you to try to connect to the internet.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:04.800]   If there's ethernet, boom, go ethernet. If there's Wi-Fi, try this Wi-Fi access point first, this one second at the last, at the end of the list, try my Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   It would be nice if in an ideal world, I would love to have multiple payment systems on my phone that could basically make that negotiation on myself saying primarily I like this payment app because I know that it puts it automatically adds more money to independent businesses than it would to other businesses.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:45.800]   Or for whatever reason, and I just simply tap and it actually works. But when we, but as, as, as pie in the sky as these things go, realize that I am very hippie in my, in a lot of my pronounce pronounce pronounceations here, but I'm also aware of like what the world was like when the court said, you know what, it's bad that AT&T has the, has the, has a monopoly on long distance.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:54.800]   We should open up the long distance business to everybody. And now all of a sudden you're, you're getting all of a sudden you have to basically navigate. How am I paying for the long distance? How many minutes am I getting?
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   And how did I suddenly get switched from this plan to this other plan without actually doing anything? It could, it could wind up being a hellscape. But you know what?
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   Maybe life was, is meant to be a hellscape anyway. And we're just meant to figure out how to survive it.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.800]   Oh boy. Speaking of hellscapes, Russia.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:36.800]   It's really, it's really hot. Okay. Russia is finding Apple now joining in, in finding Apple for antitrust laws, violating antitrust laws. And what's interesting about this is it was, I think a couple of weeks ago, I saw that Russia was planning on finding Apple because Apple was not going to store, was going to continue to not store data inside of Russia.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   But instead was storing data outside of Russia and Russia said, if you don't, if you don't start storing it here in Russia, then we're going to start finding you.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   And now the, the country has come forth with some antitrust concerns. It says, and I quote, the company has abused its dominant position in the iOS app distribution market.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   Apple prohibits iOS app developers from telling clients inside the app about the possibility of paying for purchases outside the app store or using alternative payment methods.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   So this is, you know, essentially at the heart of this is a long, ongoing discussion about Apple and its payment platforms.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   And Jason, you had mentioned earlier that the way that it kind of is affected, affects users in the Kindle app for one example.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   But there, of course, is the argument that this is a larger concern.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:40.800]   But Russia seems to be doing this after some other attempts at finding Apple for many different things.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   So this is only the latest in a long run, it seems.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   It's so sweet. Russia wants to get in on the antitrust. I have a hard time not viewing this as a way for Russia to see if Apple has some accounts that are in Russia that it was mandated to have for sales that were going on in Russia that it might be able to find and get access to because I got to be honest,
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:12.800]   I'm not sure Apple or most Western companies are counting on Russia being a market for them in the near future.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   And so, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like Apple so intertwined with China, there are lots of markets that Apple is not going to say goodbye to.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   But Russia as a market at this point, I think is not in that category.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   And Apple has paused its sales there and I think that I look at this and I think, well, you know, why would Apple care or pay them or do anything if they're essentially turning their back on Russia?
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   And I think maybe the answer is maybe there's a bank account somewhere that's got rubles in it that Russia can just rest back from them and take that money back.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.800]   And that sounds like them. So, yeah.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   Yeah, it's only going to get tighter. They just find Google something like 230 million. I'm looking up for now.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   $360 million equivalent of for failing to censor Ukrainian content and not basically making sure that Russian users only get the party line in terms of how that war is going.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   So, yeah, I think if Russia were giving Apple monster numbers instead of being something, what is it? Like 4%, something 5%, very, very small amount of how much money Apple's making.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   They're not making an argument that this is a relationship that Apple wants to bend over backwards in order to make these people happy, considering how much it's going to cost them to make them happy.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:49.800]   Alright, folks, let's take a quick break away from the legal stuff and also from the show for just a moment so I can tell you about our next sponsor, New Relic, who are bringing you this episode of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:49:01.800]   A lot of devs and a lot of devs out there are incredibly curious people and they're often the first to explore the newest tech. They dig into documentation.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   They're the folks who don't only want to know how things work but want to know why they work the way that they do. And that is why so many engineers turn to New Relic.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   Because New Relic gives you data about what you build and shows what's really happening in your software lifecycle. It is a single place to see the data from your entire stack.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   So you don't have to look into those 16 different tools and make those connections manually. New Relic pinpoints issues down to the line of code so you know why the problems are happening.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   And then that gives you the power to resolve them quickly. That's why dev and ops teams at DoorDash, at GitHub, at Epic Games and more than 14,000 other companies use New Relic to debug and improve their software.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   When teams come together around data, it allows you to triage problems, be confident in decisions and reduce the time needed to implement resolutions using data, not opinions.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   Use the data platform made for the curious. Right now, you can get access to the whole New Relic platform and you get 100 gigabytes of data per month free forever with no credit card required.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   I feel like I need to read that again because this is, wow, you get access to the whole New Relic platform and 100 gigs of data per month free forever without even having to type in your credit card.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   Sign up at New Relic dot com slash Mac break. That's N E W R E L I C dot com slash Mac break.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   New Relic dot com slash Mac break. Thank you so much New Relic for sponsoring this week's episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:46.800]   All right, we are back to the show and I wanted to kick things off for this segment talking about Apple Arcade, check in on Apple Arcade.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   So one of the things that we just saw at, I think it was at WWDC, Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference was a conversation around gaming on the Mac.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   And Apple is sometimes accused of, I don't even know if it's an accusation, maybe observed as being the company that is the mobile game platform.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   But I think that there then is the criticism that Apple is not the sort of PC gaming company.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   And I felt like what they had talked about at that Mac event, well, in part, that Mac event was that it is working on making Mac OS itself as well as the hardware behind Mac OS, powerful and capable enough to run some of these AAA games that we see out there.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   But while all of that is going on, we do have to again recognize Apple as a mobile gaming company.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   And one of the places that exists is Apple Arcade. And I'll check in from time to time on Apple Arcade.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   But now there's a list of games that will be leaving Apple Arcade soon.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   We sometimes see this on Netflix and Hulu where there are some deals that have gone through and so those apps or those shows will leave.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   And now the same thing is happening in Apple Arcade. So I just wanted to check in with you, fellas.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   If any of you play any games from Apple Arcade or use Apple Arcade and I'm curious about your thoughts on sort of the future of Apple Arcade.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:24.800]   If this is going to continue to be something that Apple really digs into or not.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   Yeah, I only use Apple Arcade sporadically.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   I use it as a, I use it for snacking, so to speak, because I think what it's really, really good at is finding those little games that aren't going to take up your brain for three weeks.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.800]   It's going to be a good time for a few hours and then maybe you'll dip into it again the next day.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   And more than anything else, you know that it's not going to be filled with pop-up ads.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   It's not going to be where you steer your card around the course once.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   And then at the end of the first lap it says, "Congratulations!
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   Now, hey, why don't you improve your cart with a new engine and new racing stripes and how about a new hat?"
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   So that's pretty much what I'm using it for.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:11.800]   I'm so glad that they are starting to let people know that, "Hey, these games are certain games are about to expire and about to leave the store."
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:21.800]   Because it does give a sense of urgency to make sure that you know that the Apple Arcade library is a living, breathing creature.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.800]   It's going to be changing with things coming and going as you go.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   And I have to admit that I'm looking at the list right now.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   I don't recognize any of these games.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:41.800]   But if it gives attention to this list of like 10 or 20 games and makes people discover them simply by the fact that you don't know what you've got until it's gone,
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   you may as well give dreadnautical or don't bug me a try.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.800]   I think that's a really good thing, an important part of the consumer experience.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   I have to admit, we play a little Apple Arcade and then we also have an Atari, one of those Atari's that has all the games built into it.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:03.800]   At some point the other night I was playing some Space Invaders and I was like, "Apple should just buy Atari. It's like $400 million.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.800]   Just buy the whole thing and just tick all the app.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   All those games on there, then I'd play a lot more on Apple Arcade.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   And then you could update them all.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:21.800]   You know, have a click the 20-25 version versus the original version and probably do really well.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:26.800]   I think that I don't know if people have a strong expectation of the Apple Arcade stuff.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   And I don't know, it seems like that's going to be a really, there's a lot of momentum to play AAA games on a PC and on desktop boxes and so on and so forth.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   I think Apple is doing pretty well with kind of more of the casual gaming. I think that one of the things that they're really missing is, I mean, they're doing, I mean, they're really crushing it with casual gaming.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   And I think that they can continue to do that.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:56.800]   I think that they do need, if they really want this to turn out, they need a breakout game. They need a game that everyone's playing.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:02.800]   And I think that that could be done, but it would take a lot of decisiveness that I don't know if they have to do that.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   But building some great game that people have to be part of and what is Apple's Fortnite, so to speak.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:19.800]   And I think that there are opportunities there, but you'd have to kind of start throwing some pretty hard numbers at something to make that work.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.800]   I think Apple's done pretty well with Apple Arcade so far.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   Most impressively, perhaps, is that they seem to have recalibrated, right?
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   There's that sign of like, does Apple just push something out onto the ice flow and then walk away and hope that it doesn't sink?
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   And that the initial launch was interesting and they tried to build up a catalog.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:55.800]   And then at some point they realized, "Oh, what we really need to do is we need to have some exclusive games, and then we also are going to put some money toward taking things that are in the App Store and pulling them in in a free for Apple Arcade members version that doesn't charge."
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:04.800]   And then we're also going to go to some of the classic games that people remember playing on their iPhones that have kind of fallen out of off the App Store.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.800]   Their tech is a little bit old and the developer doesn't have a reason to update them.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   And we're going to basically pay them to pull those into Apple Arcade and get them up and running on the latest versions of iOS.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   And that is a much better approach.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   I think they've been successful with it.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   They brought back a lot of people's favorite games from the past.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.800]   You can play them now again on your iPhone. I think it's such a great idea.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   And as for my personal use, I go on and off with Apple Arcade.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.800]   There are games that come on and I play them.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.800]   And then the "Altos Adventure and Altos Odyssey" series.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   They did revisited versions of those games with extra levels and it got me back into that.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.800]   I play Flipflop Solitaire from Zack Gage.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   There are a bunch of games that I do play that are Apple Arcade games in some form, often classic games that have been brought in.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   I think the truth of these games is probably that they don't get a lot of use.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.800]   And Apple is cutting games that are not played a lot from its catalog.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   That's my guess.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:06.800]   My understanding is that there's some compensation you get from Apple for having your game on Apple Arcade.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:11.800]   And then you're compensated more based on, I think, it's time of use.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:17.800]   The amount of time that Apple Arcade subscribers spend in a game actually factors in to what they get paid.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   And maybe different contracts are different.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   But my guess is that they're cutting from here and I hate that experience on any subscription service where there's a game or show or movie or whatever that you expect to see and it just vanishes.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.800]   I think it's really frustrating and I just am opposed to it generally.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.800]   But that's probably what's going on here.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:46.800]   And when I saw the list, I thought, "Well, I would be more upset if it was a list of things that they had promoted that were big deals that were reasons for you to get Apple Arcade."
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.800]   And that's not what it is.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:59.800]   It's more like they're, again, I kind of admire them really seeming to be pretty active on sort of defining what the rules are for Apple Arcade and changing what the selection is and trying to find a sweet spot there.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   And I hope they keep doing it.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:07.800]   Yeah, it's a very safe spot to let your kids loose on where you know that it's an all you can eat buffet.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:14.800]   You're not going to be wrecking up, letting them rack up $1,000 worth of in-app purchases and in-game purchases.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:21.800]   And you know that they are up to a certain level and that they at some point, some human being and Apple has said, "Okay, we don't...
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:28.800]   We believe that this game is not going to result in a press release, in a news story that we're going to have to react to at some point in the future."
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:42.800]   So it's very possible that the role of Apple Arcade is not simply to give Apple a bigger slice of the gaming pie, but simply to keep people inside the Apple ecosystem in a way in which Apple can deliver something that that customer wants.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:47.800]   It's an important part of your nutritious Apple bundle as well, right?
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   As a $5 a month thing, if you use it a lot, great. If you don't, there's that question of like, "Should I be paying for this?"
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.800]   But I converted to the Apple One bundle because I was buying iCloud and all these other things and you roll it together.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:10.800]   And there's something freeing almost about saying like, "I don't need to be constantly interrogating Apple Arcade or Apple News or anything else and be like,
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:17.800]   Am I using you?" Because it's like, "It's almost free at this point, right? It's almost like, well, I'm getting it for all these other reasons.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   It's free and now I can look on there and play the games too."
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:26.800]   And that's, you know, not everything in the bundle has to be like the 100%. We got to use it. It's a must-have.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   Sometimes it is that just kind of a creation that happens where you throw a bunch of stuff into the bundle and you realize,
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   "I'm glad it's there even if I don't use it every day."
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:47.800]   I got to say, though, that I also converted to a bundle and it does bother me a little bit that if I could pay the exact same amount of money
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   and have these things individually, I'm not sure how strongly each one of them would pass that smell test up.
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:06.800]   Do I like Apple News enough to actually subscribe to it? Not really. Do I like iCloud enough? Not really. Do I like Apple Arcade enough?
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   Not really, but if I can get a bundle so I can back up my iPad and my iPhone without having to actually interact with this at all.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.800]   If I can occasionally use Apple News to read things that are behind payables on our News Rear Web.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:29.800]   On and on and on. I just wish that they were because alternatively, I love Google Photos.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.800]   I pay for unlimited on Google Photos because it really works great for me.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:39.800]   I love Dropbox and I love other cloud storage systems.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:46.800]   I love certain other news reader apps. There are things that I pay for because I love them and I want them to keep going
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.800]   and I want to keep getting them. I just wish I felt that way about all these Apple services.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.800]   I think there's a lot of times there's an inertia to it as well though because it's kind of like Apple News wasn't that good
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.800]   but now I find myself in it most of the time. It was one of those things like I was like, "It's okay."
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.800]   It drives me crazy that if I block something, it constantly tells me this was blocked.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.800]   I'm just like, "Okay, well, when I blocked it, I didn't want to look at it anymore."
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   That's my biggest complaint about it.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   But I think that it is this inertia and a lot of memberships, that's kind of the deal.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.800]   You try to build it up to a point where the sum is bigger than whatever you were going to make a decision about.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:27.800]   I do think as long as we don't lose cricket through the ages, that's the...
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.800]   If they start taking that off, then I'm going to be like, "I don't know. I don't know if I can keep on doing this on Kade."
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:40.800]   That's the idea that you're not making three separate $5 decisions or $5 or $10 about Apple News and Apple TV Plus and Apple Arcade
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.800]   But instead, it's just part of the bundle. It is freeing in the way of, "Well, did I watch For All Mankind?"
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.800]   Yes, I did. That's good. And then this other month did I play Altos Odyssey? Yes, I did.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   So that's good. Was there that big feature story in the Wall Street Journal that somebody linked to when I don't pay for it?
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.800]   But it was in Apple News. By the way, that's pro tip.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   If there's a Wall Street Journal article that you want to read, you just search for the headline in Apple News
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.800]   If you've got news plus, it's there. It's amazing.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.800]   I don't want to be making monthly decisions about if I'm using those features.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   I just don't want to do it. And that's the brilliance of throwing a bunch of different things in the bundles.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:23.800]   They only have to be occasionally helpful as long as you're getting enough out of it for it to be worth it.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   That's what the game is that they're playing there.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.800]   There's a good reason why Slayer and Night Ranger and a couple of their metal bands from the 80s, they always tour together.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.800]   They don't tour separately.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   That's why we have County Fair.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.800]   What's why County Fair exists? Come on.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.800]   As a package, OK, 40 bucks, but I don't know if I want.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.800]   It's a lollipalooza retro bundle. Sorry, that's a different decade, I know.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   But we're just talking about concerts and yeah, yeah, it's the County Fair.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.800]   So what you're saying is Apple One is the County Fair of Technology bundles. It's very good.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.800]   I think that we should end this before we get insulted.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:04.800]   OK, which one is the Night Ranger? Which are the Apple services? Is a seg-seg spot, Nick? Which one?
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   Did you see that Apple's paying $50 million for the butterfly keyboard?
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.800]   I know.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.800]   I'm for it.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.800]   Right.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   I'm not sure that at all.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   So Apple is going to pay $50 million in the settlement over the MacBook butterfly keyboard lawsuits.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.800]   Of course, this was a lawsuit that was...
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   Because this would be my actual lawsuit.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   It's like we get $1.83 in the mail.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   It's not.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.800]   No, this is the... We always complain about, "Oh, great. We're going to get a check for $1.25."
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.800]   It's actually like if the more you suffer, the more times you had to take that damn thing back,
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.800]   the more you're going to get.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.800]   I think the top thing is like $430.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.800]   We're going to take it back two or three times.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   We only had to take it back once. You get $150.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:04:01.800]   I think that anything could have... We already had a big neon sign of failure on the butterfly keyboard
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:09.800]   simply by virtue of the fact that Apple just quietly said, "Yeah, we decided not to have that on any of the new apples anymore."
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   But when we're like, "Okay, you know what? You kind of got us.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   We will write handsome checks to the people that we made suffer."
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   Because let's not let this die in legend.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:26.800]   That there are people that... Things just kept breaking and breaking and breaking.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   They had keycaps replaced, they had entire keyboards replaced, time and time again.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.800]   Apple stuck to their guns for like three iterations of this thing after it was...
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:40.800]   I mean, I was early on the bandwagon, but most of my complaints were that I just thought the keyboard sucked.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   It just sucked as something to type on.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   But then we also found out that, "Yeah, but unfortunately, if you are...
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:54.800]   If you are operating it inside Earth's atmosphere, particles of that atmosphere will get underneath the keys and destroy it."
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.800]   And that was probably not something that came up in testing.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   If not, I hope they didn't release it based on that.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   Andy, I'm not sure that crumbs are a vital part of Earth's atmosphere, but yes, your point is well taken.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]   It's a bear in my order.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   It's a bear in my order.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800]   That also didn't work right.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   So great.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   I just...
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800]   You know, one of those things like...
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.800]   I kept on thinking that I would... I was like, "Oh, this looks really cool."
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.800]   And I just found that I didn't type on it very much.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.800]   It was always like, "Oh, I got to go to another computer."
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.800]   And then there was some point about a month or two in.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.800]   I was like, "Wow, this keyboard really stinks."
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.800]   You know, I didn't have the same experience at Andy had.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.800]   It was just... It was kind of like one of those things.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.800]   Like I just found myself finding other places to go to type other than my laptop.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   Part of the reason that this case is making...
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   But it's made it this far is because, and I think this is a fair point, not only, you know,
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.800]   did the keyboards, they seemed rather defective in the first place because so many of them
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.800]   got, you know, this issue.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:57.800]   But when you took it in to get it repaired, then they put in the same keyboard, obviously,
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:01.800]   as they would, and then it would continue to be an issue.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.800]   The next time some dust got under there and it wasn't working, or the key got a little sticky.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:12.800]   So the argument is not only that these felt rather defective in the first place and that
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.800]   the design was kind of crummy and long-term use.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   There was a pun that I didn't...
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.800]   Actually did not intend.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   Ha ha!
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:25.800]   But that over time, even if you, you know, paid to get it fixed with that, you know, $150, $200,
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.800]   $125 replacement, it would then replace it with a keyboard that was the same thing that would
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.800]   then happen again.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:38.800]   So yeah, I get where that concern comes from, or the ongoing concern at least.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.800]   Yeah, it actually got me kind of angry because it was just such a stupid design decision
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.800]   because I'm kind of...
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.400]   I didn't get super angry about deleting the headphone jack from the phones because I thought
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:58.800]   was anti-consumer, but there was a practical engineering reason why that was a good idea.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:03.800]   There are benefits to not having a headphone jack inside the iPhone and they could legitimately
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.800]   say, "Look, there's every square millimeter of space inside this case is precious real estate.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.200]   We just don't even want to have the space to use that space for something that we don't
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.800]   think everybody's going to miss."
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:21.800]   But for that to have a keyboard with what was it, less of 0.52 millimeters of key travel
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:28.780]   on a MacBook that was not really thinner than anything else that Apple had ever made, that
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:35.840]   made it a stupid, just design choice as opposed to a way of making it thinner, a way of making
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.920]   it more comfortable, making it more practical.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   No, somebody...
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920]   Somebody...
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:44.600]   We're not going to name who, but he just lost his contract with Apple and it is related
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:50.100]   to Apple, decided that, "Oh, the idea that these keys are sitting too proud from the
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:54.700]   surface of the MacBook, that offends me in a way that I can hardly contain.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:55.940]   We must have flat keys."
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:59.780]   And after he was talked off of the idea of, "What if we just had a flat pane of glass
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:04.960]   with etched glass representing hinting at where the keys should be struck?"
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.560]   They were saying, "Well, could we make...
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.200]   They negotiated down to less than... to about half a millimeter and then he made for it.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.200]   That's what gets me annoyed.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:16.560]   We make a stupid design decision just for aesthetics, just for style.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:22.360]   This is what we spent half of our lifetimes defending Apple haters about that they're
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.820]   going to go, they're just like cute design, they don't really care about performance.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:27.340]   Yeah, here you kind of got us.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:30.140]   This was a stupid design based on just style.
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:33.380]   Well, I think it's worse than that though, because I think that there was a reason they
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:37.220]   designed this keyboard, which was for the 12-inch MacBook, which was super thin, and
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:40.340]   they felt like they needed a thinner keyboard, so they designed it for that.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:44.980]   The problem is that Apple has this pride of invention and also like this idea of they
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:45.980]   want to...
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.700]   For lots of good reasons, they want to recycle their stuff.
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.420]   So you see this to this day, right?
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:56.300]   It's like, "Oh, the new feature that continuity camera in the next version of Mac OS has center
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.800]   stage in it, and it has portrait mode in it, because they already made those things, so
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.080]   we'll recycle them."
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.240]   But somebody somewhere made the fatal decision to say, "You know this MacBook keyboard that
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.600]   we made because we needed it super thin?
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.040]   Let's just use it everywhere.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.640]   Sure, what could be the problem with that?"
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:16.760]   And it wasn't a good keyboard on the MacBook either, but to subject every other laptop
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:22.560]   user to a keyboard that was essentially just designed for the skinniest of all their laptops.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.360]   And then on top of all that, it turns out that it's actually not resilient in terms
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.480]   of real environments that are not a white room with nothing in it.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.440]   A featureless white room, I don't know who would live in that room.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.440]   Probably somebody whose contract just ended with Apple.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440]   So anyway, yeah, here we are.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.760]   At least the keyboards are better now.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.200]   But I mean, should Apple pay people for the butterfly keyboard angst that they went through?
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.760]   Yeah, yeah, they should.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.360]   They should spend money on that.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.360]   They should.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.680]   That is a great lawsuit for them to sit.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.040]   This was really bad.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:00.480]   Tim Cook should have to sit at his desk just like Nathan in the jerk, writing out, "Mr.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.440]   John Kamila hoodie $400.12."
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.960]   He has to type it on a butterfly keyboard.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.960]   And every time it does a double E, he has to backspace.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.120]   And then do it again.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.200]   Maybe that's why they finally added mail merge to pages.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:24.040]   Because you realize he's going to have to hook up his PFS file to the WordPress.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.240]   That's exactly why they added mail merge.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.080]   Oh my god, you figured it out.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.280]   Hey, remember when we talked about the butterfly keyboard every week?
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.280]   Oh, old times.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.440]   It's a little nostalgia shot here.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.080]   That's exactly what it was.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.080]   Oh boy.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.040]   Well, anyway, it's gone.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.040]   Goodness.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.560]   Goodbye to you forever.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.200]   And now they're paying for it in more ways than one.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.040]   One other quick little story before we take another break.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.560]   I did see there's a Wall Street Journal article.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.640]   It is tied behind a paywall.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.040]   But I've seen some other conversation about this.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.040]   News plus.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.040]   News plus.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.040]   There you go.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.040]   That one, Micah.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.040]   Yes.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:12.000]   So there's talk of SIM cards, these very silly things, going away in hopes that the ECIM,
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.200]   which is very popular in other countries, sort of takes over.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:22.920]   And one thing I didn't realize is that the iPhone 13 was shipped without a SIM installed.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.480]   And I guess that's the first model where that happened.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:33.800]   And I have used a SIM card, actual physical SIM card in the past.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.720]   And at some point there was the offer to turn it into an ECIM.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.440]   And I did that.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:44.360]   And it was a whole horrible nightmare mess where for a while I didn't have my phone number,
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.280]   the phone number I've had for years and thought I was going to be this whole thing.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.680]   And it ended up getting fixed.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.680]   Thank goodness.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.680]   And it was all okay.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.720]   And now I'm ECIM and everything's fine.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:59.280]   But I, like for people who have used a SIM and then tried to make a change to an ECIM who've
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.520]   had the same experience as I have, I can understand a hesitancy on having the SIM card go away.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.800]   So if I throw aside all of my experience and I just think about the fact that we have this
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:14.080]   little plastic and metal thing that we stick into our phones to make it work whenever all
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.920]   it is is telling the phone things that we could just have the phone know in the first
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.800]   place, that's bizarre to me.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.400]   Like what, how, who invented the SIM card of the first place?
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.960]   Why did we ever do this instead of just having it all built into the phone?
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.960]   I don't know.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   How are you?
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.960]   What are your thoughts on SIM cards, folks?
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:30.960]   Wow.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.960]   There's, there's my red ring.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.080]   No, I was just gonna say talk about, talk about retro.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.440]   We're talking about SIM cards now.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:42.640]   Yeah, my daughter is in Europe for a month doing a summer program and we set her up with
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.400]   an ECIM and it's the first time I've actually ever used that.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.640]   And it was super convenient.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.160]   My concern, and this is not a general concern, but like my concern about it is what you said,
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.120]   Micah, which is there is something that feels very safe about putting that piece of plastic
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.960]   in a different phone and knowing that your phone identity is essentially transferred.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:07.040]   And I, if you can assure me that moving from phone A to phone B is a very smooth process
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.080]   and that I'm not gonna get a phone call from my carrier or that my phone number is not gonna
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.520]   transfer properly and I end up having to wait on hold on an 800 number, then let's do
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.520]   it.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.520]   Let's go all the way with the ECIM.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.520]   But that's my fear.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:24.720]   And as somebody who reviews phones, I am transferring that SIM card all the time.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.320]   And it's so, that's why I haven't switched to an ECIM.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.200]   It's because it's so convenient to just pop it in another phone and now my phone number
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.560]   is over there.
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.680]   And I am a little worried and I know that that's an edge case, but I'm a little worried
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:43.240]   about that putting myself in the hands of my carrier to trust that this transfer has
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.800]   been honored and all of that.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.200]   But if they can solve it, yeah, having a plastic thing, you stick and your phone is dumb.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.600]   It totally is dumb.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:55.120]   But they need to prove to me that they're not gonna disappoint me before I switch.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:01.200]   And I'm realizing I lied because I now remember I was just looking at my phone.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.160]   I went into the store and said, "I just switched to Stonisse.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.520]   I want my physical.
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.000]   I need a SIM card again."
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   So that I wouldn't because I was so concerned about it.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.880]   So yeah, I have a physical SIM 2 for the same reason.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.240]   If I want to pop that into another phone, it's very easy to do and I don't have to worry
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.240]   about it.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:20.440]   It's like, "This is the thing that says, 'This is my number and remains my number.'"
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.080]   So yeah, I have that concern too.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.080]   And it's also nice.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.080]   You leave the country.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.640]   You swap out into the new SIM.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.600]   When you get back, you just put your old SIM back in.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.600]   You're back to where you're...
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.600]   There's no fuss to us.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.040]   The beauty of the ECIM thing though, so like Apple supports this now where you can have
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.560]   a SIM and an ECIM and it's a dual SIM system.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:41.880]   And it's really nice having only experienced this with my daughter when she was going
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.760]   away to the Netherlands is you get nap, you get the ECIM.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.760]   It installs it.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.760]   It's like installing a profile or something.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.400]   It installs into the system.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.800]   Then you've got two cellular connections and you can do things like say turn off cellular
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:01.040]   one and turn on cellular two or turn off the data on one and keep the voice on it but
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.160]   use the data.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.680]   You can choose to prioritize.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.320]   So there's a lot of flexibility there.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:09.000]   So you actually could do it where you just turn off your US SIM when you're traveling
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.440]   if you want to and it stays in and then you just see them as they're...
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:16.240]   Historically, historically, but I think I'm on ECIM now and I'm quite happy with it.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.400]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:24.080]   It's really nice and some of the fear is you try it out like I did a couple months ago
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.280]   and you realize, "Oh, Apple has actually done a very good job of supporting this.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:32.520]   It's built in multiple SIMs and ECIMs and it's been there for a little while.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.320]   They had a dual SIM phone in China.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.320]   A few years ago, they sort of kicked off this whole process."
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.400]   And like, "Yeah, I'm like Micah.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.400]   I'm just a little trepidatious because I'm worried that I'm going to have to review an
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.920]   iPhone and try to transfer my number and then it won't ever come back."
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.800]   And then I had to charge up an Android phone.
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.640]   Yeah, I had to charge up an Android phone and get a Mint Mobile plan again really quick.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   Ooh, it's a sponsor of the network I should note.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.600]   And so that I could call AT&T and say, "Hey, I need this fixed."
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.120]   And no, it's not with this number.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.120]   It's with the number.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:09.280]   So that was scary and that's why I was like, "I need a physical SIM back as quickly as
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.800]   I possibly can."
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.760]   But if you're starting new, then that's fine.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.760]   Go ahead.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   No, no, no, go ahead.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.320]   Yeah, no, just I'm with you.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.640]   I just feel very much in control when it's like I've removed this physical object from
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.640]   this one device.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.320]   I've inserted it into this other device.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.400]   And Verizon did not try to stop me.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.680]   AT&T did not try to stop me.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.600]   At no point did I have to say, "Oh, why do you want to use a new phone?
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.600]   Why do you use our phone?
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.960]   Oh, they're using Verizon instead of us."
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.560]   And that doesn't seem, that concern doesn't seem to have played out yet, but I just don't
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.200]   want to be in a situation like Mike is in where something happens and now I have to trust
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:55.600]   a customer service apparatus to put things right and make sure that my cell number remains
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:56.680]   my cell number.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:02.160]   I will say though that having since we just talked about deleting the headphone jack, it
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:07.640]   is the SIM tray is another point of ingress for dust and for moisture and stuff like that.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.360]   So if we believe that deleting the headphone jack was a good thing for the longevity of
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.920]   the phone, we also have to believe that the SIM card tray is another thing like that.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:20.160]   So I think it's going to be there's like a whole generation of people that I got into
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.680]   when the ATM networks started popping up, I had no problems with it, older generations
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.840]   had a problem with it.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.120]   But for me, it took me two years before I would deposit checks by phone because I'm like,
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:39.240]   it just can't possibly work.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:39.760]   I take a picture of it and I set a push and basically, but don't they need the check?
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.880]   And for like two years it was available.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:45.520]   It was available at my bank, but I would still go to the ATM once a month with like three
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.080]   or four checks.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:51.040]   Sometimes you just have to, you have to keep a toe in the water and then just slowly let
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.400]   yourself get acclimated to a new technology.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.440]   And I think for myself, I'm being honest, easy, it's just like that.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:01.360]   Yeah, I'm more concerned with the unknowns of this that there's going to be like it seems
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.360]   fine.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.360]   Like I'm totally okay with the idea.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.160]   There's a little bit of data on the SIM card.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.640]   Now the data is an e-SIM.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.640]   Like that's great.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   Like fantastic.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.880]   Why do we have these pieces of plastic?
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:13.960]   My concern is that you're going to switch to a new phone for the third time and you're
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.760]   going to get a note that says AT&T is noticed that you've used a bunch of different things
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.760]   with your thing.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.080]   Therefore your account is locked like or that they do it after a certain threshold that
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.360]   most people will ever hit.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.800]   And then if you hit it, you will run into a brick wall and you have to go through multiple
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.920]   layers in order to get it taken care of.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:38.520]   Just my concern is more just institutional incompetence or just a lack of focus on the
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.000]   part of a cell carrier more than anything else.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.280]   But otherwise it's great tech and I hope it all works okay because it sounds like we're
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.440]   going there regardless and it's probably all for the best.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.840]   But it may be a bumpy ride.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.840]   That's what worries me.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.240]   And do you see a case like us?
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.720]   Yes, we need to take another quick break and then we will come back.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.120]   I think we can go ahead and go into picks of the week after this.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.200]   But I want to tell you about ITProTV who are bringing you this episode of MacBreak Weekly.

[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.760]   We are back from the break.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:27.520]   Before we get into picks, there was one last story that I wanted to mention because I saw
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:34.880]   a lot of different people saying a lot of different things regarding the relationship
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:40.440]   between Apple and Johnny Ive after he left the company.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.880]   And now I'm having trouble finding the link here in the document.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:51.480]   But there was conversations surrounding how long Apple was working with Johnny Ive and
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.800]   even if there it is in the New York Times.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:59.840]   And even if that original, the partnership between the companies was maybe not actually
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:02.080]   a realistic thing.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:08.520]   The article from Trip Michael, quote, "three years after promising to work long into the
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:14.400]   future with a man behind its candy-colored computers, Apple and Mr. Ive are through."
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:21.360]   So how long do we really think that Johnny Ive and Apple have been sort of collaborating
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:28.680]   with love from Johnny Ive's own design firm and how much of this is just kind of nonsense?
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:29.920]   It was good PR.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.400]   I mean, you were like, it was good.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.760]   I mean, I think that there was probably some cracks.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.680]   I mean, that led him to leave.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:38.520]   There were some cracks probably for a couple of years before that.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:46.120]   And so I think that he was very focused on some very specific design requirements that
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:51.720]   a lot of us we just talked about, butterfly keys and really getting into this design form
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:57.560]   over function that I think became pretty hard, became untenable in a lot of places.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:02.120]   And I think that obviously what he did was amazing for decades.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.040]   But I think that that continued.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:08.160]   And I think that I think Johnny Ive had a hard time when he couldn't bounce it off of Steve.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.960]   I think Steve brought a certain level of, no, let's not do that in a nice way.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:18.080]   And I think that without that, he was kind of, I think that there was a yin and yang there
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:25.120]   that when Steve, it was no longer there, I think at that point things were going to
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.280]   just slowly, slowly unwind.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.280]   He just didn't have it.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.280]   He didn't have a foil.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.040]   Who's going to say no to Johnny Ive other than Steve Jobs, right?
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:33.880]   Exactly.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.400]   And they're like, well Johnny is here to carry the torch.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.960]   And it's like, well who's going to say no to him?
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.160]   Is Tim Cook going to say no to him?
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.160]   Tim's not a product guy.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.560]   Tim's like, oh no, no, Johnny, you take care of it.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.120]   I think that was part of the issue.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:47.320]   This is though in general, it's just a long, slow fade, right?
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.160]   There's some corporate jobs end really rapidly and others just fade away.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.520]   And everything we heard is like he wasn't coming into the office regularly.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.400]   He was bringing people up to his place in San Francisco.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:01.920]   He got a new title that was sort of a courtesy title, but he was really kind of like removing
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.240]   himself from the day to day.
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:08.000]   Then they do the formal separation, but wait, we're going to keep a relationship with his
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   new firm.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.360]   It's going to be, and it's like for all concerned, it's good for Johnny.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.360]   He gets some money.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.560]   He gets to start his new business.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.640]   It's good for Apple.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:20.080]   They don't freak out investors about the fact that this design genius who is part of
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.120]   the revival of Apple is gone too close to the death of Steve Jobs, right?
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:29.040]   They got to space it out a lot because imagine if Johnny had left after, right after Steve
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.040]   died, right?
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.680]   Like, oh my God, everybody would have lost it.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.800]   So orchestrated, everybody gets a little money.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.160]   There are some details about people saying, we're paying him what?
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.400]   He doesn't do anything for us.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.400]   Why are we paying him that?
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:45.600]   And the answer is you're paying him that because he's Johnny Ive and you wanted to make it
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.600]   a gentle transition.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.880]   He has not been running the show of stuff.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:57.440]   By the way, we haven't even mentioned there was a story last week on GQ in the UK which
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.800]   quotes Evans Hanky who is Apple's lead designer at length about the design decisions that
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.360]   she and her team made about the MacBook Air and about last year's MacBook Pros and like,
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.240]   is it a coincidence that Evans Hanky was prominently featured in a press story that was pretty
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.200]   fluffy and very positive when this was all going on?
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:19.000]   Of course not because they're sending the message that it's all okay at Apple.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   It's all fine.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   We love Johnny.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.920]   We paid him a lot of money and now the relationship is finally over.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.920]   Like it's just very well orchestrated and you want to be that guy.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:32.120]   You want to be the guy who they pay to not work for you for a while because they love
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.800]   you so much and not the guy who comes in one day and realizes somebody else is sitting
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.640]   at his desk.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.920]   The bottom line is that Apple did make a little bit of money from Johnny's designs.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:46.720]   So they could pay him back a little bit.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.640]   You know, on the way out.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.640]   There's a goal.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:56.040]   It's not like he hung out for two decades and didn't create some of the most iconic pieces
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.120]   of hardware ever.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.520]   So, you know, a little bit of, you know, and I'm sure he's doing just fine.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.000]   I'm sure he's been doing just fine for a while.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.680]   I think he was bored.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.880]   I think he was bored, right?
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.600]   I think there's a natural endpoint and I think it came at the point when Apple was desperate
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.840]   to not be seen as losing all of its key contributors because Steve Jobs had died.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.800]   And so I think there was one of those things like Johnny, what could we get?
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:22.000]   Back when I had a senior vice president title at a media company, like you have those moments
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.120]   where you're like, what can I do to make you stay?
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.880]   I'll give you any job you want.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.320]   I'll give you any title you want.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.720]   I'll get your raise.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.120]   Please don't go.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:35.920]   And I think that happened when Johnny I was like, look, how many more computers can I design?
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:41.880]   And he did design some amazing things from the G3 iMac that saved Apple really and the
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.840]   iPod all the way through the iPhone.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:50.760]   These contributions are legendary and will be for decades to come, if not longer.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.000]   But I think he was ready to all things.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.760]   There is an end.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.400]   And I think he was done.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.280]   I think the culture is very different at Apple too.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:03.800]   I mean, I think that Steve had a certain he was trying to get something done and the logistics
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.120]   were something he handed off to Tim Cook.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.680]   And then it was Tim Cook is working on the logistics.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:16.160]   And I think that there is more of a managed process and more of a council of people making
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.240]   decisions.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.440]   And it's a little bit more diffuse than it was before.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:23.200]   And I don't think Johnny I was the first person to complain about those situations.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.640]   And a lot of people that just weren't, they wanted that kind of hunger and that edginess
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.400]   that came with Steve that they didn't have.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.520]   And a lot of people have left because of that.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:38.600]   It doesn't mean that Apple is making any, I mean, Apple still, you know, Tim has really
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:42.120]   managed the ship pretty tightly and really grown the company.
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.800]   If you look at the growth of the company, you know, over the last decade, it's been pretty
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.800]   amazing.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.880]   And so it's not like he's not doing it correctly.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:54.160]   He's just not doing it the way that many of the old guard were used to.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:01.680]   And Lizzie, I did make was responsible for a lot of transformative products that were
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.320]   absolutely had a big hand in Apple success.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.880]   He also created the solid gold $12,000 gadget.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:14.120]   Your favorite Andy and the and the and the 10 million dollar tent that you needed to make
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.560]   sure people understood what you were going to forget the coffee table book.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:21.840]   Don't forget the coffee table book of his great accomplishments.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:28.360]   Yeah, sir Johnny, sir Johnny, let me need to put some respect on his name.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.360]   Let's get into the pics of the week now.
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.520]   Let's start with Andy.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.680]   Andy, not go what is your pick of the week?
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.920]   My pick of the week is something that's been around since February, but has just been sort
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:43.920]   of like validated as kind of safe for most people to actually use.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:49.000]   It's a Google's new version of Chrome OS, Chrome OS flex, which is they released it in
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   February, basically telling people that, hey, it's in sort of experimental mode.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.160]   But if your computer doesn't blow up when you install it, could you please like send us
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:01.500]   an email so we can add to the list of computers that don't blow up when you try to
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.300]   install Chrome OS flex.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:10.860]   But yeah, I mean, I have I've had it on this 2010 polycarbonate Mac book for like two months.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:15.420]   And it does like what what is advertised it gives you it basically takes a machine that
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:24.860]   is a nastat most can run give you a nostalgic experience of what it was like to use a Macintosh
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:33.960]   in maybe 2013 at the latest and actually turn it into a absolutely arguably a modern PC
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:40.040]   with a modern web browser that can run any base that is that runs the latest version of
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:44.580]   the of the Chrome browser has the latest security patches onto it hasn't been abandoned like
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.080]   10 years ago.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:51.800]   And the nice thing about it is it is free and also you can you don't have to you on this
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:56.080]   one I've actually just basically installed it as the primary OS but you don't have to
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:01.160]   you just like on Linux distro you can install it on a you can create an install USB stick
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:05.440]   and then just simply boot off of the USB stick give it a try.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:10.480]   I think that if you haven't ever tried Chrome OS you might be surprised at how good it is
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:16.880]   after after 10 years 15 years of baking in the oven because you will realize that you
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:22.640]   will make you remember that G I do spend a great deal of my time in in web apps and the
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:32.000]   fact that as it essentially is 80% a web browser 20% notebook desktop style features that make
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.900]   this usable as a notebook or as a desktop that won't be quite as scary after you spend
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:43.840]   like a couple days running Netflix running Google Docs running iCloud apps on it you
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:48.720]   might actually kind of like it it's it's just a great way to take take an old machine that's
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:54.400]   out of out of the closet or in this case I bought it for $10 at the MIT flea market like
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:00.040]   about you know and actually have like I've like I said not a hey look isn't it isn't
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:06.920]   it isn't this a wacky like time travel curio it's like no this is as capable as a lot of
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:14.000]   what I would do on my on my on the M1 MacBook Pro that I bought last year again limited
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.320]   to the stuff that I do inside the Chrome browser on my MacBook Pro but nonetheless I'm over
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.320]   the past two hours I've been looking at a Google Doc that we've got our show notes on
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:29.160]   I've been checking up on other things in tabs in that browser so definitely worth a worth
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:34.000]   a look at it over 400 different machines are officially supported and many that aren't
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.720]   on that list are will also work fine but again you can try before you you commit to installing
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:43.160]   it really good stuff and I think you'll be surprised at how nice it is.
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:48.200]   All right let's go next to Alex.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:54.640]   So I generally don't like a lot of stuff that requires subscriptions like little subscriptions
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:59.440]   that I feel like a home and I get over and I and I signed up for this one and I keep on
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:03.040]   going I'm gonna get rid of it but then I use it often enough that I'm and it's so cool
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:09.200]   when it works which is always so far and it's called picture this and I just feel like
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:17.160]   I can't believe I bought an app that identifies plants but but there is something about it.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:20.920]   You just see it you see something you go what is that and I just you take a picture and
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:24.880]   and boom it's there it's like okay that's an agave and this is kind of this kind of agave
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:32.440]   and this is or whatever and so and it's like I found out I take a picture of my the plant
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:36.920]   by my pull it and it's got this huge pole suddenly coming out of it and said yeah that's
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:41.960]   an agave plant and it's going to die.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:45.600]   And so I was able to plan you know but the point is is that I started taking pictures
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:49.160]   like I had I had a tree that I couldn't decide that it came when I bought it it came with
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:53.000]   the house and I couldn't decide whether it was a lemon tree or a lime tree and so I took
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.560]   a picture and I was like no that's a lemon tree and I was like oh I should I've been eating
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.560]   them too early.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:05.480]   So anyway so the so so the so but what was funny was is that every day every couple days
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:09.160]   I'm out wandering around and I just have this curiosity of what I'm looking at and I take
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.880]   a picture of it and it tells me what it is and then I can get more information and I
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:18.920]   can get you know and and I and I find that to be just I guess beyond plants I find it
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:24.600]   just fascinating that we have something on our phone that we just take a random photo
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:28.160]   and it just tells us what it is and it's so it's accurate and it gives you a bunch of
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.200]   information and to me I guess I just feel like I wanted to bring it up because I feel
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.680]   like it's just magical like there's very few apps that I just go I'm living in the future
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.840]   anywhere I can just look at something and just go take a picture of it and go so that's
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.920]   what that is and I'm like oh because there's so many times and now when I'm you know if
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:48.840]   I'm out for a walk I just use it constantly like oh what is that I wonder what that is
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:54.840]   and what's interesting about it is is when you have the app it changes the way you look
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:59.840]   at the world because there's like a oh I'll figure that out I'll take a picture and then
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:03.840]   I'll do a search on Google and I now I got to figure out how to describe it or maybe
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:09.400]   I'm gonna upload an image to Google and we'll see if more come down and there's like a process
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:13.000]   when it's just effortless you just do it all the time and now and then what happens
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.720]   is is that you know everything along your walk that you you know all the plants and
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:21.280]   then you start observing them in a different way from a different filter in your brain
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:26.600]   you know and and so I so at first I thought it was just I was like I from an AI perspective
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:31.560]   I was curious and that's why I bought it and now I'm just really it just it just brings
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.280]   me an odd level of enjoyment that's worth I don't know and I think it's like three ninety
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.880]   nine a month or something like that and I keep on thinking for the first couple months
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:39.680]   I was like I'm gonna I wasn't gonna recommend it because I was like I'm gonna use this
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.440]   for a couple months and see if I actually keep using it but now he said all the time so
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:47.920]   that's pretty fun now that this is what a reality should be all about they keep the
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:53.080]   keep showing us demos of hey look and you can you can have a dancing Pokemon on the top
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:58.400]   of your desk like okay that is a cool demo but what I really want is to be walking around
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:03.920]   and as soon as the thought occurs that hey is that a is that a maple or is that an elm
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.720]   and suddenly there'll be a dingus that says hey by the way that's an elm and by the way
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.520]   it has the it has it has a it has a disease that all of the elms in the in the wing of it
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.440]   are getting so you should you should enjoy this one while you have it because as you
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.520]   can see by the ends of those tips that yeah and that's that that's a certain you're absolutely
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.840]   right the idea of hey that's interesting and maybe you will make a note and maybe you'll
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:30.600]   follow up on it versus at the point of curiosity you're feeding your mind that is a very very
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:35.440]   powerful thing I did not expect there to be this much plant death discussed on this episode
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:42.080]   it's very disturbing there's a there's a free up called iNaturalist that does a similar
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.640]   thing so if people want to try a free app that would be an alternative it's the interface
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.120]   is probably not a slick but it the machine learning models for this stuff I I yeah I also
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:54.120]   don't know any plants or trees and always wonder and now you literally just hold your
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:00.000]   phone up it's it is yeah at the point of curiosity like like Andy said very cool alright our
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:08.040]   next pick comes from Jason oh boy it's it's scriptable scriptable is a free app on iOS
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:11.560]   it started life I believe is really just the idea that you could use JavaScript you could
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:17.320]   write JavaScript apps do your JavaScript development mess around with little JavaScript scripts
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:24.120]   on iOS right but I think it really took flight when it added in this other feature which is
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:30.440]   support for widgets on iOS so now you can write if the apps that you use don't give
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:36.760]   you the widget that gives you exactly what you want you can write your own and in JavaScript
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:41.680]   and so and I did so one of the things that I did is we had a bunch of terrible fires as
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:46.400]   well probably is about to happen again out here in California and I wanted an air quality
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:51.920]   widget that used the purple air network and I I wrote a JavaScript widget that put the
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:59.600]   air quality in my local purple air the nearest purple air sensor on my desktop or on my lock
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:04.840]   screen on my iPad and then I wrote one that pars my weather station at home and made a
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.720]   widget of that and then recently I started playing around with Apple's new weather kit
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:16.280]   API and I made a I made a script that looks at the widget and pulls the forecast and charts
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:24.080]   it and makes a little chart of my local forecast from from all just from data on the internet
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.840]   using JavaScript and just parsing it out which is pretty amazing so I made my own little
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:32.020]   widget the equivalent of something like the old weatherline app that went away except
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.460]   it's my own and I did it all using scriptable and it works on your iPhone it'll work in
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:41.020]   all the different widget sizes that are available you can write one script that will have different
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:45.640]   presentation and the small widget size versus the medium with widget size versus large and
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:51.940]   extra large and as a little tidbit the developer is now beta testing a version of scriptable
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:57.020]   for iOS 16 that will let you do that with lock screen widgets so I'm actually going to
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:03.440]   be able to put my temperature in my backyard on the lock screen of my iPhone which is also
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.680]   just pretty awesome so if you've got an idea for something and you're wondering why doesn't
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:12.560]   this thing exist guess what make it yourself in if you can do JavaScript make it yourself
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:20.400]   with scriptable that's a cool I hope I hope you live a long long life of happiness and
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.920]   health and safety I just hope that like when you when your day comes you've made arrangements
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:29.780]   so that on your tombstone will be some sort of a chart that's being generated by a script
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:35.220]   automatically by a script that would be your perfect epitaph you are that is one of eight
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:39.540]   things that you are you are the man of the chart is mostly going to be trending down
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:45.900]   at that point which is okay I can accept it it'll trend very quickly until about six
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:51.700]   feet and then it'll just little flat on how much you know just track track the amount
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:56.500]   of nitrogen like inside the casket say you know what there really is you may as well
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:39:00.980]   like just not stop visiting because really there's nothing left to visit at this point
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:08.940]   thanks well this is very grim it's not just it's not just planned death it's jason death
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:19.400]   no too okay so the my pick I've been looking for just a nice simple bag that is not necessarily
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:25.700]   a backpack that I can use when I go into the to it office in particular and for me I like
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:33.160]   to carry my water bottle I like to occasionally carry I've got this bag that goes over my shoulder
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:38.760]   that it's sort of like a purse and it usually sits on my side but when I'm going into the
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.840]   studio I usually slip it in my backpack and then I want room for the laptop that I take
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:48.160]   with me as well and there are lots of course lots and lots and lots of options out there
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:55.960]   but in case sent over this bag that I'm really really liking because it's simple enough but
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:01.960]   also has the things that I want without being so much more so it's called the the two way
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.320]   transfer tote and the reason why it's called the two way transfer tote is because it can
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:12.160]   be a tote it's got handles for you to tote it around which is nice but it also has some
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:16.320]   D ring loops on the back and some clips at the top and it comes with straps so you can at
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.880]   any time convert it into a backpack so I can you know if I want to bring it in as a backpack
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.400]   I can do that and what I want to carry it as a bag I can and it's got water bottle spots
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:31.160]   on both sides which is quite kind of nice because there are times where maybe I'll have
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:35.080]   my water but then I will also have a beverage at work that's you know something else so
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:41.240]   then I can go in there and plenty of zippered pouches the inside though can hold up to a
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:46.760]   16 inch laptop if you have it which is what I have right now until next week when I transition
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:55.040]   to that new MacBook Air and it is super soft inside and has lots of storage space lots
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:41:00.080]   of open space to tuck things into and as I said I really like just the simplicity of
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:08.480]   this I'm a pin guy and I like to I have pins on my bag and I'll show you my bag I have
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:16.240]   pins that I put on my bag and so I'm planning on transferring some of these pins over to
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:21.520]   my that that in case bag and I also have some other pins that I'm like hey Jason you know
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:28.560]   that one yeah you're comfortable robot is right there so anyway there's plenty of blank space
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:33.360]   on that that's a lot of fun but I just I like this two way idea that hey sometimes I don't
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:37.600]   feel like carrying it I just wanted to go on my backpack on my back rather and carry it
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.640]   as a backpack and it can do that so and in case you know long time maker of products
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:50.040]   that are kind of purpose built to fit in particular Apple gadgets and Apple you know laptops and
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:56.240]   whatnot so pretty enamored of this it is available for 99.95 on in cases website and
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:01.640]   of course will include a link in the show notes and I saw and thank you I saw somebody
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:08.960]   ask for it in the chat but Jason's on that so thank you Jason again simple and so far
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:14.480]   it's it's working well for me so I wanted to give them a shout out for that that bag and
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:20.640]   with that we have reached the end of this episode of Mac break weekly Andy and not co thank
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:24.600]   you so much for being here if folks want to listen to you on the radio where do they
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:31.360]   go to do that and when go to wgph news.org they have they will live stream all of my appearances
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.640]   they also archive all my parents as you can check that out I'm going to next up on usual
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:42.080]   time Friday at 1245 in the afternoon eastern time you can stream that at wgph news.org
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:48.320]   or you can actually go to the live stream of wgph on YouTube or if you are in the Boston
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:53.720]   area drop by the Boston public library gph has this big nice studio in the middle of like
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.920]   this little cafe that's on like the first floor the Johnson building of the Boston public
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:01.440]   library the library is a lovely lovely place get yourself a cookie cup of coffee you will
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.160]   have to pay for both of those and you can watch the show.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:11.840]   Excellent Alex Lindsey of course folks can head to office hours dot global if they want
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:17.840]   to check out what you're doing have you been broadcasting despite the the covid train.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:22.360]   You know the great thing about it this this this larger group that's built up around office
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.640]   hours is that I just just said I just you guys handled this for a while so for a couple
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:31.240]   days I built Davis and a couple other folks so we're able to take care of all of the you
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.800]   know that there's a huge machine that kind of runs it every morning and so it's I'm just
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:41.840]   the not just the puppet in the middle and so so the so so I was able to go to sleep and
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:46.960]   they they took over and ran great shows we've had I started to kind of roll back in this
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:53.480]   week and we had a great conversation with NFTs on and making them and what it takes and
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.600]   so on so forth on Monday today we're playing with lots and lots of microphones so we're
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:02.800]   testing microphones together and tomorrow we're talking about motion capture the Nick
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.480]   Nick Justin from Drexel University will be talking about what that is and then good
