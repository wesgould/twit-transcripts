[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.640]   to cover the latest news from Apple with the help of Renee Richie from YouTube. Hello
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.720]   Renee Richie. Good to see you. I'm ready. I'm ready for all the Apple news Leo and if
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.960]   there's no news we will just ban the entire show. Comic book news today. Nothing but.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.680]   That's Andy. That's the turtle of the one and only Andy and not co from a knocko.com
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.400]   and WGBH in Boston. Alex Lindsay was going to join us. He's at a family reunion in Cape
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.640]   Hatteras and I guess the bandwidth in Hatteras was not ideal. So I thought that I thought
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.760]   that Ben with just sort of followed him around. Yeah I know like like like like like hungry
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.600]   cats and like affectionate dogs. I I'm kind of stunned that the Alex Lindsay couldn't
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.400]   find bandwidth. He's one of those dwarven strong hells from Lord of the Rings because
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.680]   that could explain it. I don't think they had Wi find. But that's fine. I'm sure it's
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.240]   better for him to enjoy his family reunion than it is for him to have a reunion with
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.520]   us. He sees us every week. So enjoy Alex and the three of us will hold down the fort.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:20.640]   It was 14 years ago today that the so little the iPhone came out. You lined up Leo? Yes
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.800]   as a matter of fact I was lined up. It was announced at WWDC in January. But the very
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.880]   first iPhone that came out you could get was in June. I waited in line. So I debated
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.240]   whether going to San Francisco to the San Francisco Apple store. I thought that's going to be crazy.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.200]   There's a pictures of Robert Scoble and Scott Bourn and others coming out of the store doing
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.640]   this. This is what everybody did. That's the New York store holding up the the bag going
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.800]   I got it. I got it. That's Vincent from Slash Gear. That's a famous story. Oh really? Steve
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.360]   Jobs. Oh nice. Yeah. Yeah. People waiting in line was absolutely how you got an iPhone
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.920]   for the first few years. I waited in line. This is from 9 to 5 Max. Wonderful kind of
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.000]   look back at retrospective. I waited in line as it turned out in the local. I thought,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.400]   you know what? I'm going to have a better shot at getting one because you couldn't pre-order
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.040]   online. You had to get in line at a store and stores had a limited number. This was
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.240]   for the first few years. I thought I'm going to wait in line at my AT&T store. It was fun
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.080]   waiting in line for the first few years was really fun. You'd meet interesting people.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.720]   Do you bomber with you? Yeah. I was right. It was in Petaluma and a bomber was not there.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.880]   I was behind the two guys who worked on Google Reader at the time, Google's RSS program and
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.880]   they said they'd been up all night making a work on the iPhone, which is pretty cool.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:57.480]   They were there like almost like professionally saying, we need to send some people down to buy
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.800]   an iPhone and then right as soon as the charge bar gets to 22% see if the system actually works
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.240]   and then let us know. Here's the Seattle store. Eric won't share his. Here's the Seattle store
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.880]   pulling back the curtains. iPhone world premiere tonight. It's 6 p.m. I didn't, I forgot that because
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.840]   later years we waited overnight, but I was actually smarter than the evening. What did you do Renee?
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.800]   You weren't able to get it in Canada. No, I had to wait until it was jailbroken and then have
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.880]   one smuggled by Jawas over the border. I did that forever, MacArthur. I jailbroken one and brought
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.480]   it because you could do it at the time and then put it on your networks, Rogers. And then it was
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.920]   a TIFF exploit. You had to do is load a TIFF picture into the fucking your phone was jailbroken.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.680]   It was amazing. You're up. Yeah. Here's Steve Wozniak going in the Palo Alto Apple store.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:52.760]   Pretty pretty exciting. God bless him. All the different and it's legendary that like of course
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.120]   someone at the inside the Apple store would see like Steve Wozniak of all people just like waiting
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.680]   in line like in a deck in a folding chair and say, Oh, no, no, come in, come in and come in and
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.760]   pause with no, I want to be outside with everybody. I want to wait in line like everybody else.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.640]   Here's a wonderful photo. I have not seen before from the Palo Alto store. That's Steve Jobs
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.080]   on the left, obviously in the baseball cap talking to Bill Atkinson next to Bill. The
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.240]   smiling Andy Hertzfeld, the two of course guys who are most responsible for the Mac,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.200]   the first Mac. So that's pretty, pretty cool. Really need to see them.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.520]   Yeah, in there. It's it's too bad. The really it's it's I honestly didn't remember that this was
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.000]   the anniversary until of course I'm on Twitter and suddenly everybody's like give give them their
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.880]   their stories. Oh, here's where I was. And here's what here's like a personal memory I have about
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.360]   the the launch of the iPhone. And it makes I'm I'm companies have to grow companies have to move
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.680]   forward as they become two trillion dollar companies. They kind of lose that they have to lose that
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.400]   kind of personal touch is just what happens. But it's it's kind of sad that we're kind of
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.640]   no, no one's gonna no one's gonna have stories 10 years from now. Where were you when you got
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:09.880]   your first M1 M1 iPad? It's or even probably the Apple Watch, but it does show you at the time when
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:17.000]   Apple was still very much on a rebuilding sort of arc, redemptive arc as the as the the the
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.160]   folklorist would say that it really did feel like we are we are the freaks. We are the geeks. We are
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.360]   the the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. We have a sense of community and we bond together
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.440]   through shared experiences such as it wasn't so much that we wanted to like be the be the first
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.360]   to have like a trendy tech gadget. It was that well, I bet that same reason why a lot of us are
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.520]   first in line to buy tickets for like a Star Wars movies like I want to spend the night
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.280]   camping out in a parking lot with people who like me are crazy enough to want to camp out
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.960]   overnight. The crazy one. The crazy one. The first the first showing first day.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.720]   So it's pretty cool. I think differenters. Here's a picture. I didn't this is actually kind of
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:09.240]   surprising. I didn't realize that the Apple store was selling the iPhone 2 online. Francois Poo
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:16.200]   got this put it up on Flickr. This is we'll be back soon. It says on an iPhone. We're busy updating
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:22.840]   the store for you and we'll be back. Web objects will be back by 6 p.m. Pacific. You can see it
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:30.680]   says Web objects in the URL. You can also see that the advantage of this because Francois has
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:38.040]   dig news in his bookmark bar as well as delicious two things that have since come and gone and come
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:43.880]   again. Here's the original iPhone. Here's the current iPhone. Yeah, it's kind of funny.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:51.400]   Pro Max. It's so small. This I didn't this has eight gigs of storage which is.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:57.240]   Oh, I meant this was 32 camera. So wait a minute. Am I confused? Is this this is the 3G?
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.200]   Yeah, that's the original one. This is the original one. No, that no, that exactly. The one you're
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.840]   lifting up is the because remember it had the to make to accommodate the oh yeah and 10 is it had
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.280]   plastic on the bottom also is a 2G phone not 3G. So this is the 3G. I got the wrong one out.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.560]   This is the Apple original Apple iPhone and this one only has eight gigs of storage but you didn't
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.120]   need it because there was no app store. Yeah, exactly. What did you need it for? It was an
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.080]   Internet device. I'm going to find a 30 pin cable and then charge this up because I'm sure it'll
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.320]   still work. Look out. The other thing to look at. I have a case on my iPhone. Let me take it.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.520]   This is actually as thick as the iPhone with a case on it. Leo, the original iPhone could hollow
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:46.120]   out your Macs and use it as a tonton to keep warm in the winter. Volume rocker. No. Oh, actually,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:54.520]   3 pin sim slot at the top. Here's the on off button and it had a headphone jack. Well technically
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:02.440]   it said phone jack. Exactly. It had sort of because that that curved bezel was aesthetically
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.960]   more important than usability. They've recessed it so deep that like a standard headphone jack
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.080]   would. It was a standard headphone jack but your standard headphones would not actually reach deep
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.440]   down to actually make contact. So you had to get this again. It was the start of the dongle wars.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:25.400]   That's right. Because you couldn't put a regular head for that. The Apple ones fit fine but
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.600]   anything wider than the Apple one. Yeah. The dongle. Yeah. It's so tiny. And yet we were all
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.040]   thrilled to get it. It was the biggest they could make at the time. That was the biggest
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:39.080]   screen that they could fit into the place at the time. Wow. I have a bigger screen in this on my
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:48.920]   printer now. Oh, compared to an Apple watch. Yeah. It's kind of close to the size of the Apple
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:55.320]   watch. It's the original Sam's watch which pretty much turns a pixel. The Apple store
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.880]   employees got special merch. These are the launch shirts given to them Friday, June 29th. The wait
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:10.040]   is almost over. And say hello to iPhone. Wow. This is just I'm so glad that nine
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.880]   five Mac put this together. There's the bag you got. Yep. Yep. I remember that bag. If you didn't
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:23.640]   order online, I guess it was a really nice bag. And of course, the packaging designed by Alan
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.240]   Die quite famous. Die told students at Syracuse University, every single black
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:35.160]   iPhone box had to have its corners painted so that there wouldn't be any color in consistency.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:42.600]   They wanted a black box. It was completely black. So some poor Chinese person had it paint
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:49.480]   every corner on every box to make it black. That's what you got. Like that's what you got
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.040]   Apple interns for. Yeah, really come change, come change the world with us. But first,
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.840]   here's a Sharpie. Here are a couple of master cases. You got a lot more accessories in those days.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.400]   Of course, there was more room in the box because the phone was so small. Yeah. You got a white plastic
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.760]   dock that was designed for the iPhone, large power brick earbuds, the 30 pin connector cable,
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:15.880]   a black microfiber cloth with iPhone. Oh, I wish I had that embossed on it. And a crystal clear
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:21.480]   tray that held the iPhone. This is a picture of all the all the things. You could buy that.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.400]   Yeah, you could buy that Bluetooth headset that they made. Oh, yeah, that was like a yeah. Wow.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:32.200]   And you can just imagine that the microfiber cloth was a specific demand from Steve Jobs.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.040]   Given all the stories that came out about how upset he was, but how bad the iPhone looked when
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:43.480]   he took it out of his pocket, like with the original plastic screen and the casing, that he
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:50.040]   nothing nothing must blemish my precious. Here's the iPhone stereo headset. This was controversial,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.960]   the white color on the headsets. People didn't make white headsets in those days.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.880]   Turned out to be a brilliant marketing move because anytime I guess it was for the iPod
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.720]   that first came out. Any time you saw somebody with white headsets, you knew, oh, yeah, there
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.240]   he's an iPod. Even the ads had some of those iconic ads with silhouettes and just the white
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.440]   headphones. Yeah. Here's the iPod iPod. While Mossberg's first review.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.680]   His he wrote, we've been testing the iPhone for two weeks in multiple usage scenarios
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.520]   in cities across the country. Our verdict, this is in the Wall Street Journal. Our verdict is
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:27.000]   despite some flaws and feature admissions, like now cut and paste, the iPhone is on balance a
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.280]   beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer. Its software especially sets a new bar for the
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.520]   smartphone industry. It's clever finger touch interface, which dispenses with the stylus and
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.960]   most buttons works well. Although it sometimes adds steps to common functions, a breakthrough
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.520]   handheld computer, he called it. Yeah.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.840]   Pog says quite famously in his review, the iPhone matches most of its hype.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:55.640]   Ed Begg who also got a review, early review unit reviewed it in USA Today. Stephen Levy for
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.480]   Newsweek said in a sense, the iPhone has already made its Mark Jason Snell,
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.920]   read for Macworld in 2007. The iPhone is a real deal. It's a product that has already changed
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.560]   the way people look at the devices they carry in their pockets and purses. After only a few days
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.960]   with mine, the prospect of carrying a cell phone with me wherever I go no longer fills me with
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.600]   begrudging acceptance, but actual excitement. Nice job, Jason. Well done.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.760]   He was so different. The man I was sort of trying to first time would scroll and it would
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.360]   the inertial, the rubber banding. It was just such an object in like the classic apple sense of
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:36.040]   object design. Yeah. I got to I got a briefing right after it was introduced at the keynote like
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.720]   three or four months before it was actually introduced. And I had I think like 45 minutes
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.520]   and Joss was there a couple of other executives there. Wow, nice.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:50.600]   And like usually like that's an opportunity to I gotta make I gotta maximize every minute that
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.160]   I'm there any any all the questions that I came up with that I can get I can get a direct answer to
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:01.560]   but even there even there I specifically remember saying okay go go over to the banquet over there
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.640]   and get a cookie in a soda because I just want to spend 15 or 20 minutes just like playing with
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:12.600]   this. And I just remember it was just intoxicating after having things that that scroll like pixel
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   animation almost it was just so fluid moving between apps was just perfect. I must have gotten
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.640]   one of the ones that actually had Wi-Fi working because I was loading web pages and it was working
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:31.320]   it was it's it's hard to communicate the first time getting able getting you getting hands on with
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.760]   advice like this after years and years of like devices like this which was like sort of like the
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:43.000]   the day Jude this is I can't I was trying to remember like how long how long was it before I
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.640]   actually got my first bought my first one my own that's the HTC with an apple sticker on it.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:53.320]   Yeah, I remember I put when the because I had because I had an apple rougher the same size.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.160]   Yeah, I had an apple owner but like I felt like I couldn't I couldn't use it after I did my review
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.320]   so like I still like okay someday someday this year I'm gonna be able to buy like a regular
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.840]   iPhone yeah look how small the camera opening is I had a 2060 and I themed it to look like an
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.120]   iPhone because you can keep those back there. Oh you're funny. You're as much as I could to look like
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.560]   an iPhone. I was using the Blackberry Pearl before I got the iPhone it was my last Blackberry ever.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:24.280]   Blackberry Kevin says thank you. Here Casey Neistat was in line at the AT&T Store in Union Square to get
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:30.840]   his iPhone and and made a video which he didn't release until four years later when Steve Jobs
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:37.000]   passed away. This is his this is his video. I made this movie in June 2007 for the launch
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.240]   of the original iPhone. I never published it. Now seems like an appropriate time.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.440]   Oh man I remember that moment that was a mac real big spin.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.160]   We are on our way to waiting line for the iPhone. Oh my god this is brother right?
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:59.000]   And I think it's him. Is it? Oh it's his brother okay. Yeah his brother's got a channel now.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.040]   I never got a cabbage patch kid when I was little. Never had a Furby and didn't get Nintendo into
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:11.560]   it to buy him at a yard sale. My ship had finally come in and Steve Jobs is a captain. Our plan was
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:18.200]   to follow. Leave Amsterdam. Vital Lisbon for a one hour. 6 and a half more hours. This is this
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.920]   little primitive period of cases the latest works but it's still creating the beautiful.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:29.160]   As Casey watches various internet videos I'm getting concerned. Vans concerns were warranted.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.600]   Reports from New York spoke of lines with hundreds of people in them and we still hadn't chosen
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.480]   our location. We've just landed in the United States. The iPhone comes out in less than 22 hours
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:45.560]   for looking guys. iPhone news. Case how many more hours? 21 hours left for honor. Wait a minute.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:51.640]   This is great. This is really great. What a period piece for several reasons. It's great to see Casey
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:58.840]   and I sat with long air. No no none of his sunglasses. That's the Apple Store so-ho people all around
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:05.480]   the block even in the rain. So they decided not to go to the Apple Store. There's the TT.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:11.800]   Line. Line right up. Maybe right behind you. Give me a line. Pioneers.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.040]   All right. We'll be right back with our tents.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:20.840]   What a cool car. I go through cell phones. No kidding. But everybody was pretty excited about
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.880]   this. Including this at this point it was such a novelty even including the folks at the AT&T store.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.960]   There's this sidekick. I remember that. It's hard. I had every one of these phones.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:38.680]   It's easy with 14 years of hindsight to think, oh gosh. The iPhone completely-
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:45.320]   The smartphone market was totally more abundant before and Apple invented the smartphone.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:51.480]   But actually there were a bunch of really great phones that people love. There's a generation of
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:58.120]   teens whose entire childhood nostalgia is based on talking to their friends over their sidekicks.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.680]   And also when you think about how the original iPhone begins here.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.240]   Yeah. Mattress. He's the only one in line.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.320]   Well, yeah. Feeling slightly less special. Again.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:20.840]   Ask why we don't have better things to do with our time. A man is a success if he gets up in the
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:26.840]   morning and goes to bed at night and in between he does what he wants to do. Bob Dylan said that.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.200]   It was Woody Guthrie that said, "I know the police caused trouble. They caused trouble everywhere.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.320]   But when you die and go to heaven, there'll be no policemen there."
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.840]   But there were policemen outside the AT&T store around 6 a.m. giving us a hard time.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:47.720]   What just happened? Officer Mcaroni woke us up about five minutes ago. We were all out cold.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:53.080]   And he just kept repeating himself, "What the hell are you guys doing? What are you guys doing?
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.000]   What are you guys doing?" And every one of us gave the exact same response. It was something like this.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.880]   And then he started laughing and gave us back our IDs and said, "I have a nice day. Enjoy your
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:13.480]   f***ing bones." I'm sure the NYPD got a little more used to this notion in years later.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.640]   That's the New York experience we're hoping for. Yeah. There's now four people in line.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.960]   Oh, they're starting to put up stanchions. It's getting serious.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:28.120]   Mine's getting a little longer. Looks from the New Yorkers getting a little weirder.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.520]   Oh, it's pretty substantial. Casey and his brother did a good job getting there early.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.360]   You lined up for a phone? And they had a Air mattress, his intense.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:45.960]   Please print clearly. Here's your put your name on a card. The guy's letting them in.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.800]   He's going to get his iPhone. That was a great moment when you got your iPhone, wasn't it?
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.000]   Because it wasn't sure until the minute you got it that you were going to get it.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.920]   Because the only had 20. This is the sort of social justice that Woody Guthrie had in mind.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.880]   No, exactly. He was more about like Pinkerton goons eating up and shooting unionizers.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.280]   Yeah. That was opposed to buying off a drink.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.000]   Consuming a device. Not exactly what Woody Guthrie did.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.840]   But it works. It's a fun film.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.440]   Really well done. Early Casey and I stat we've uncovered here. This is good.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.600]   And then of course the tribute to Steve Jobs. It's true. Without Steve,
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.480]   I think it's safe to say there would be no iPhone, right?
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.880]   He got angry so often to make that iPhone happen.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:36.600]   It really didn't work for a long, long time. His wife's friend had to be bragging about how
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.120]   Microsoft was going to reinvent touch. He had to get super angry about that.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.560]   And he had to get super angry about his phone. That it was a piece of garbage and that they
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:49.880]   should make a phone to fix it. When people make fun of Microsoft and others for dismissing the
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:57.320]   iPhone after it came out, that's a little bit of self-history rewriting because you have to
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.120]   remember that your options, if you wanted to have a really good phone that could give you a big,
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:08.040]   big productivity or fun experience, you can go into the AT&T store and buy, have your choice of
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:14.200]   three or four, most of which had app stores, most of which had cut copy and paste.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.160]   I can't remember if 3G was starting to roll out then or if that was like a year later.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.040]   But this was feature, the first iPhone was very feature poor when it first came out.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.160]   So you really had people who very much believed in the concept of an internet device,
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.640]   particularly people who had Wi-Fi in their homes and now were in their offices and now we're able to
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:39.800]   again surf the web before that one of the most significant things about the iPhone is a reason
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:46.680]   why one of the big, it's a phone, it's an iPod, it's an internet device. It was the first one that
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:53.000]   had a web browser that actually let you browse the damn web as opposed to even the most expensive
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.560]   smartphones would fetch sort of a bastardized version of the website or give you a website or
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:05.880]   something that had absolutely nothing to do with the page layout or the typography or the images
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.720]   that you would get if you actually hit the New York Times site.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.960]   They considered that a feature, right? Like a proxy bandwidth saving feature at the time.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:19.080]   Somebody caught the jobs family at the Apple Store, Steve Jobs and his wife
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:26.280]   Lorraine at the Palo Alto Apple Store. That's not Lorraine. Oh, there she is behind him.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.640]   I think. Steve, we have five of these phones at home. Why are we here?
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.920]   Steve, why are we at the store? Well, talk about kind of taking a victory lap, right? I mean,
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.160]   it's the same reason why Stephen Sondheim is in the audience on opening the app. You want to see
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:48.280]   how the audience reacts to the work. Yeah, look at the crowds, phenomenal success.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:53.240]   One of the very few conversations I've ever had with Johnny Iave is when he was talking amongst
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.920]   some of his colleagues and they were saying how great an event was and he just said,
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.280]   is it really? Do we really know what the product is until it gets in the hands of the customers
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.360]   and they tell us what it is? That's really like their attitude the entire time.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:14.440]   Yeah. What a success for Steve to push that through against all odds. He had a huge success with the
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:19.960]   Mac. He wouldn't show it to AT&T. They kept asking him. He kept giving him a couple of
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.680]   two explanations. They had no idea what it would even look like.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.840]   Here's a from Popular Science iPhone launch hysteria. This is all thanks to 905
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.400]   Mac, which collated all of this on their website.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:37.640]   Then for the opening of the Apple Store. Convening the cube.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:43.400]   Not quite romancing the stone, but I guess that's it. It's reference to the skateboarding
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:50.120]   moving, gleaming the cube. Oh, is it? Okay. I missed that deep cut. Sorry, you'd have to be a gen X.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.920]   It wasn't a big, big movie. It was something that you.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:03.400]   Zoomer was an X. Here's the activation process. You had to use iTunes. Welcome to your new iPhone.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   Let's get started. Plug it in. Activate your phone with AT&T. There was no other carrier,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.440]   of course. Register and get an iTunes store account. Put your contacts, music, and more on your iPhone
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:24.280]   all through the iTunes app. That was a smart move too. Other phones, they might even
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.920]   have app stores, but it's not as though part of the setup process was, by the way, give us your
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.840]   name, your address, and a credit card number on file. If you set up an iPhone, you have an iTunes
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:40.440]   account, which means that the ground is well prepared for selling you lots of other things
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.320]   through this phone. That was probably part of another part of the pie regarding the iPhone
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:52.120]   success. All these credit card numbers on file. In the first 30 hours, Apple sold 270,000
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.120]   phones. Within 74 days, they'd sold a million. Steve said it took nearly two years for that
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.920]   many iPods to be sold. I think it was an instant hit, but remember, it was also overpriced.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   I really spent some money because this was the 8 gig. This was the big one. There was also a 4 gig,
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:18.600]   the FlexFruision. They stopped selling the 4 gig model by September, 2007, and also cut the price
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:24.920]   of the 8 gig phone by 200 bucks and gave people who spent that 200 bucks, a $100 store credit.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:30.600]   I don't remember what I got with that store credit. Of course, now a billion iPhones in
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:40.680]   people's pockets. Pretty amazing story. What a great success. 14 years ago today,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:46.760]   and as Apple fans, I think it's really fun. What's special about 14? Nothing.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.560]   Exactly. We'll do this again next year, I promise you.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:55.720]   If the anniversary fell during WWDC, we probably would not be having this conversation.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:03.080]   It's nice that we do get to have this conversation because Apple, it is still a community. It's still
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:11.560]   some ways a culture. It's fun to revisit the time when Apple was still in that rebuilding
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:20.280]   transition. It seemed as though the company was so laser focused and had such a small product line
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.880]   that it felt like this is everything that the company was working on at that time. You certainly
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:31.480]   got that effect when this is the reason why it was worth flying 3000 miles to wherever
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:38.120]   two C Steve Jobs roll out at something like this because the amount of pride,
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:44.200]   he was just glowing. I get to show this to everybody. Finally, I get to see their...
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:50.760]   I know what their reaction is going to be. An empire strikes back when Luke Skywalker says,
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.640]   "This line, I want to be at the front of the theater facing out, so I take pictures of what
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.360]   people are going to shout and say as soon as this thing gets unveiled." It was great to see.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:06.760]   One of the things I miss about Steve Jobs, was there at the iPad? Was there other events too?
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:16.840]   Let's not forget that when Apple showed off the iPhone in January, it was barely, barely working.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:24.440]   There have been some really great stories about the... Blackberry didn't believe it was real.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:33.640]   Famously, Lazeridis and Jim Ballzily watched the iPhone veiling in disbelief.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:42.200]   This is from losing the signal. Lazeridis said, "These guys are really, really good."
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:48.600]   Ballzily said, "It's okay. We'll be fine." They don't have a keyboard. They don't have a
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:56.040]   fader. Maybe not so much. One of the engineers who I can't remember where this was, was it wired,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:04.280]   wrote a great piece on how fragile that demo was and how... One thing went wrong, the whole thing
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:11.160]   would crash. It was a path. There was nothing random to the sequence of operations. It was like
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:19.000]   restoring power to Apollo 13. It's like, "No, first you do this. Then you make the phone call.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.960]   Then you open the webpage." One of the money quotes from the story was that we were backstage
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.280]   doing shots. Every time Steve did something and it didn't crash, we took another shot.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:36.680]   By the end of the thing, they were quite drunk. This was in the New York Times magazine.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:46.280]   I finally found the article by Fred Vogelstein. It was quite an article. I remember in a quotes
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:53.480]   mostly a guy named Andy Greenion, who was one of the engineers behind the iPhone. He was
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:30:01.720]   a senior manager in charge of the radios and knew more than anybody how risky this demo was.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:07.080]   It wasn't just a victory lap for Steve Jobs. Seeing an actual working iPhone in the hands of
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:12.920]   real people, given that six months earlier, it really didn't work. It must have been pretty
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:20.680]   exciting. That must have been a very, very brutal six months getting it working.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:29.720]   Anyway, happy birthday iPhone. I still have mine. I'm never letting this guy go.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:37.800]   I've plugged it in before. I think there's nothing much on here. I might have wiped it,
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.160]   but it's still kind of cool to see it again. Now you can emulate it probably on a
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.840]   Atari computer or something. It wouldn't be too hard. Actually, there was a…
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.440]   Was it on the App Store or whatever? There was someone who wrote an iPhone 1 emulator
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:01.560]   that would run on a current iPhone and would actually connect up with a lot of the built-in
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.840]   features of the current iPhone and the current iOS. It gave you a sign of, "Oh my God,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.560]   there's actually a pre-installed YouTube app on here." That's right.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:18.280]   It was. I forgot. I think Apple nixed it. Unfortunately, because the iPhone doesn't support
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:24.040]   sideloading. Apple doesn't want this app to exist. You can't use it, but it was such a great experiment.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:30.200]   It is baffling when you recharge a device like this and you realize that, "My God,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:39.000]   I also have a perfect Chinese knockoff of an iPhone 3GS 3G that I bought in Beijing."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.280]   I remember once recharging my original iPhone and thinking, "Is this the Chinese one? Why is this
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:53.960]   so slow? Why is the graphics so blocky? Why is it… Renee, we're not getting your audio. Are you
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:32:00.680]   muted?" Okay. We're going to pause for a moment and fix Renee's audio. Actually, this would be
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.520]   good time to talk about audio with a brand new sponsor. Do you want to do that, John?
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:09.400]   Yeah, let's talk about Sennheiser. As you probably know, because I've been singing their praises,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.840]   I've been using Sennheiser headphones for many decades at this point. The best headphones
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:21.320]   on the market, I have to say. In fact, Scott Wilkinson recently recommended the Sennheiser
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:27.800]   wired IE 300 earbuds. I can't believe for the price. I've never heard better earbuds.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.240]   So I was very interested when Sennheiser announced these new Momentums, the Momentum
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:41.960]   True Wireless 2. I have to say, I would say, in fact, I've purchased Sennheiser Bluetooth
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.920]   headphones before. Easily the best Bluetooth headphones out there. When it comes to earbuds,
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.760]   you know, I'm talking sound quality. That's why you got to check out Sennheiser because they make
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:56.040]   really the best earbuds money can buy. For the last 75 years, other companies focused on phones
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:02.920]   and tablets, Sennheiser has always been about sound. They've always put sound first. And I have
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:10.040]   to say, and it's not just me, these sound better than apples. They're, in fact, CNET said, clearly
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:15.880]   superior sound quality to the AirPods Pro and the earbuds to get a few value sound quality above
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:21.800]   everything else. Very easy to pair. Their free smart control app allows you to adjust the sound
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:27.240]   of your personal preference with a built-in equalizer. I really like that feature. You can switch off
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:32.120]   your surroundings and dive into that impactful song or important episode with their new active
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:38.360]   noise cancellation feature. And boy, the battery life is great. Yeah, it comes in a charging case
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:45.560]   and has up to 28 hour battery. 28 hour battery life. Plus, this is beautiful. Look at the case.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:51.800]   Fabric covered. It's one of those cases where you get a, you know, you put the earbuds in and
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.960]   the battery charges and they look really good. Of course, they come with a variety of tips so
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:03.400]   that you can fit them to your ear hole. You want to fit snugly. That's how you get the best base.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.880]   They also have, by the way, Sennheiser is famous for their over-the-ear headphones.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.960]   Their sound bars. I mean, they really are the audio experts. And as I said,
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:19.080]   from wired, I think the IE 300s, their recent wired headphones there is nothing better.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:24.120]   But I sometimes you just don't want to put wires in, right? You don't have a headphone jack. It's
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:29.800]   a little bit complicated. I'm listening to my, it's sense that I put them in. It automatically
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:35.400]   stopped my audio, started my audio book. I'm going to stop it with a touch. These are absolutely
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.120]   fantastic. When I'm looking for wireless, this is where I go. Of course, when I'm looking for
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.840]   great headphones, I've always gone to Sennheiser. Well, settle for anything less than great sounds.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   Over-the-ear, in-ear, and now wireless Bluetooth, these fabulous momentum true wireless
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:59.160]   twos deliver the best listening experience. They've also been finely crafted for even the most
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.280]   discerning listener like me. Why settle for anything less than great sound? Come hear the
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:09.160]   difference with Sennheiser right now. This says for my first 100 listeners. I wonder how long
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.120]   that's going to last. Maybe don't wait. Go to Sennheiser.com/podcast. The promo code is MAC break.

[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:27.160]   Thank you, Sennheiser, for sending me these. And not that I wouldn't have bought them eventually
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:33.560]   anyway, but I appreciate it. And thank you for supporting MAC break weekly. We are very fond.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:39.000]   I use the big tips, but they come with a variety. I have big ear holes that come with a variety.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.920]   Right. Sennheiser. Aren't they great? They're just really the best. I just love that.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:48.120]   I have the MKH416 right here. I live on it. It's amazing. Yeah, that's the microphone.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.440]   Yeah. All their stuff is aces. Yeah, yeah. The best.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:58.600]   I just want to thank you for, there was a good reason why we talked about the
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.440]   the iPhone anniversary because during the break, I'm like, "Oh, geez, I feel left out,
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:07.400]   so I'm going to go to my drawer of old phones I can get up." I forget my... That's what I
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:13.960]   noticed that a couple of my really old phones have been exploding. Yes. My Pixel 4 XL just
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:20.440]   exploded. Yeah. I think the battery swells with a Jamaica glue weekend. That's what I'm gonna have
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:25.480]   to do something about that before there's time to empty that drawer. I know I'm really bummed.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:30.840]   Or at least because I'm in a bucket of sand. The Pixel 4 XL is the one I use for reviewing
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.920]   Android 12 and it's my Android phone. It's bursting at the seams. I guess I can't use it, right?
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:42.120]   Bursting with phototune. Can I add something else in Leo?
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:48.120]   Yes. Just in recognition is also the 20th anniversary of WebKit/Safari, which changed our world in
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:53.080]   ways that I think nobody really expected back at the time because they were... Don Melton was
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:58.440]   brought in and told that Apple needed to make their own browser and he got Ken Kishinda and he
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.960]   got the entire team together and they were looking at Gekko because he had come from
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.600]   Mozilla. He was the person who helped open source Mozilla because he was a seminary graduate. He
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.080]   knew the most curse words and Mozilla used curse words as line breaks in the code at the time.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:18.200]   So he had to get them all out of there before they went public. And so his first instinct was to
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.680]   bring Gekko over but the Gekko code base was bigger than the OS X code base at the time. They
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:29.000]   just said, "No, never going to happen." So he and Jeff Williams, I'm not a Jeff Williams.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.120]   Williamson, I'm blanking on his first name, and Ken got together and they used KHTML,
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   Conqueror. And that was tiny, a tiny, tiny footprint and it was open source and they built Safari on
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:47.000]   the single principle that you had to have zero regression. Every feature you added had to be paid
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.040]   for in performance by improvements or you make it fast or you fix something else that was slower
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.600]   and you pay that off every day and it's really worked out well for them. I think for all of us
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:05.160]   over the last 20 years. It was June 25, 2001 Don Milton forked KDE's KHTML layout engine and
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:10.680]   the KDE JavaScript engine. He explained in an email to KDE developers when he announced this.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.200]   This is a quite a Wikipedia that KHTML and KJS allowed easier development than other available
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:21.640]   technologies because it was only, as you said, only 140,000 lines of code, cleanly designed,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:30.200]   no curse words and standards compliant. But at this point, WebKit, of course, Chromium is the
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:35.800]   dominant rendering engine on the web because of the success of Google Chrome. But I think WebKit
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:43.400]   has to be number two just because it's on all iOS and Mac OS devices. Also the PlayStation.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:50.120]   It's a fork, right? The Kindle Blackberry uses it for their browser. Tizen uses it.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.000]   The world changed so much. Back then IE was everywhere. Pocket IE was a branch that people
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.800]   used WAP browsers and Apple made WebKit and made it open source. What a terrible idea.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:05.080]   Yeah. And Don became a hero and a villain because every time WebKit let them do something amazing,
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.280]   Steve was like, "That's amazing." Every time when Google Forked it and made Blink,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.760]   Apple's like, "You're an idiot." But it fits on the iPhone. You're a genius because that's
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.400]   actually a really good point because we're used to the Chromium engine, but that's a fork from
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:23.640]   2013 of WebKit. So really, he made the right choice. He took over the world.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:29.560]   Yeah. Yeah. I guess Mozilla is the only one not using a WebKit for--
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:34.200]   Yeah, Opera changed. Microsoft changed. Blackberry changed because two of the people who created
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.360]   WebKit left and went to Blackberry, they were two brothers and they built a torch browser at
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.480]   Blackberry based on WebKit. Yeah. How much did Apple contribute back to KHTML?
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:49.880]   They were the little tense. Yeah. The speed, the speed in which Apple
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.200]   contributes back is always, I think, a source of tension, but not that they contribute back.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:41:01.800]   Right. Right. The WebKit team has reversed many Apple-specific changes in the original
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:07.800]   source code and implemented platform-specific abstraction layers to make it a little bit easier
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:15.880]   to port to other engines. In July 2007, KDE moved from HTML to WebKit. So the
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:22.600]   VIC-ready was complete in six years later. Very cool. And WebKit is open source.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.400]   Right? I believe it is. Yeah. Yeah. So far is proprietary, but WebKit is open source.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:32.280]   And Darren Adler sort of took the mantle from Don Melton at Apple and he's been keeping all the
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:38.040]   green and blue apps going at Apple ever since with I think Matcha runs WebKit now.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.600]   That's a really, really, it's one of my favorite teams because Apple doesn't have that many open
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.480]   source teams and WebKit team really embraces that spirit and they do it. So and they have
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.400]   like just such passion. Like even now they're putting these technologies in to help get rid of
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.640]   passwords, but not in a really weird and human way, but in a way where like it just it handles
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:00.040]   secure tokens for you and they just keep pushing those. Google is great in terms of pushing
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.880]   Web technologies to be more like native. Apple is great at pushing Web technologies and being
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.040]   more efficient and more private. And I think we got the sort of the best of both worlds approach.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.600]   And you get all of those and sort of the same, you know, I'm sure Google still takes some WebKit
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.760]   stuff and WebKit plays nicely with a lot of the Chromium stuff, but we get the benefit of these
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.640]   huge companies making a better web browser. And of course, no matter what browser you use on iOS,
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.560]   you're using WebKit or iPadOS, you're using WebKit because they're not allowed to use their own
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:32.520]   engines. So even if you use Chrome on iOS, you're using WebKit. These are all the browsers that use
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:40.840]   WebKit quite a few dolphin. Yeah. I can't. I remember that one. Conqueror, of course,
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:47.080]   that's where it came from. Max Thon, Midori, Omni Web, discontinued, Otter browser. I never
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:52.040]   heard of that one. It's quite a few. Yeah. And even like the Chromium browser is now,
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.720]   you can get Brave on iOS, which is a Chromium browser, but it's still forked from WebKit and
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.120]   still has amazing, a whole different opinion on how the web should be. And the WebOS browser,
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:05.160]   from Palm, was a WebKit-based browser. Yeah. That's interesting too, because they wanted to make
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.200]   WebKit the foundation layer for iOS. They wanted to use it as the application development layer,
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.600]   and Don himself said, "No, it's not performant enough." And if you remember, it took 20 seconds
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:18.680]   to launch the calendar app on WebOS, so he had a point back then. And they also didn't want a
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.560]   keyboard. And all those people who disagreed politely left Apple went to Palm and made the
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:28.680]   iPhone that they wanted to make. And it was called the Palm Prey. Very nice. I have one of those too,
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:34.200]   which I checked and has not exploded. We'd know. We'd forget. I would be very
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:40.360]   just very sad if my pre-work pristine. Same. But yeah, it's, I mean, there are a lot of battles
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:49.400]   that we've, the iPhone is such a wonderful case study. And how much fighting and arguments
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:56.680]   and good decisions and bad decisions go into launching a project that's transformative. And
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   then 10 years later, it's like this thing, the success was, it feels like the success was instant
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:09.560]   and complete. I mean, Steve Jobs famously, according to later reports, he just didn't like the idea of
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.000]   apps, like native apps on the phone at all. He really did think that whatever people are going to
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.280]   want to use actual apps for, just do it in the web, it'll work just fine. And he really had to be
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:30.680]   talked into it. Thank you for bringing in another news story. You know we're a little scared today.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:37.400]   No, that's a good one. But is a big one. Huge. And that's a big anniversary. 20th anniversary was
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:43.960]   just five, four days again. Apparently, Apple is moving. I didn't realize this, but is it all
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:49.560]   of iCloud that uses AWS and Google? Is that the case or Apple runs its own network operation
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:55.240]   centers too? They have a mishmash. Yeah. And data apparently this year, Apple's spending on Google
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.840]   Cloud. This is from the information Amir Afrati and Kevin McLachlan. Spending on Google Cloud is
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:09.960]   going up 50% this year was on track to spend around $300 million, a 50% increase from 2020,
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:17.880]   moving apparently some stuff off of AWS. Apple increased the amount of this is, I guess,
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.440]   from a source, because I'm sure Apple that according to a person, it was based. Yeah,
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.280]   but it's according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. So Apple doesn't say,
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.600]   of course. Last November, Apple increased the amount of data stored on Google Cloud by some
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:38.440]   four in one month, 470 petabytes. They are over the eight exabyte, eight exabytes
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:45.080]   in total data stored on Google's servers, eight exabytes. They're paying with this from the Google
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.160]   search money, right? Like Google gives them $12 billion for the search placement, and then they
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.200]   give Google back a few hundred million for the story. Yeah. Apple is their biggest customer,
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:46:01.560]   bigger than number two, which is by dance is TikTok. They surpassed that pretty easily.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:08.200]   That's astounding. But again, we have to, the information is very good, and their sources are
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:13.640]   very good. Amir has got great sources of Google, but again, this is an anonymous source.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:19.160]   I wonder if part of this, part of this of Apple's choosing, seeming to put more money into Google
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:24.600]   than AWS, is that Google's green initiatives and Apple's green initiatives are very much
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:29.080]   in line to each other. So, Apple's saying that, hey, we want to make all of our operations 100%
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:35.640]   by 2030, they can still, they can buy these services from Google and keep that pledge.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:40.520]   That's a very good point. Apple, according to the information, cut its cloud storage spending on
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:47.720]   Amazon in 2017. It was 700 million in 2018, 270 million. That was, as it put its big network
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:53.560]   operation centers online, but they say the increased use of Google Cloud suggests that Apple has grown
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:59.240]   so big, so fast, it can't easily source materials for, develop and operate the servers needed to
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   handle the resulting data. That makes sense. It's non-trivial, as they say in the industry.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   Not only you have to build them, but you've got to get the computers, and nowadays with the chip
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:12.840]   shortage, that's getting harder and harder. Google's built really clever, really scalable,
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.920]   really sustainable, and Andy's point, really efficient modules for doing all this cloud
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:20.920]   storage. And as so much as people talk about how Google might make a custom chipset for the
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.760]   pixel, but they've been making custom chipsets for servers for years. They are really advanced on
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:30.520]   that stuff. You used to be able to buy Google Search as a blade for your server. That was like
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:39.800]   10 years ago. So, 8 exabytes on Google Cloud makes them number one, followed by
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:48.920]   ByteDance with 500 petabytes, a lot less. Number three, Spotify with 460 petabytes,
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:57.720]   Twitter with 315 petabytes, and Snap with 275 petabytes. Nobody from Google, ByteDance, Snap,
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:04.760]   or Twitter would comment, nor did Apple or Spotify. But that is an amazing number.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.480]   That's amazing. And yeah, as Apple's focus moves to services, I'm sure Apple would love to host it
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:16.440]   all. Although lately, there's a lot of criticism about network operations centers and the amount
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:25.080]   of energy it uses. There's a knock in Arizona that is coming online that uses as much water
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:30.760]   every day as a town of 50,000 people.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.120]   That is a real problem right now.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:41.800]   It sounds like the engineers there had never been more concentrated in their life because
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.480]   they kept saying, "We can do it cheaper like this. We can cut some corners here and get it done
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.760]   faster." And Apple's like, "We don't want it done cheaper. We don't want it done faster. We want
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:53.800]   it done exactly as a disrespect. Can you not do that?" And they kept going over that discussion.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.840]   Oh, and they're like, "We'll spend the money it takes. We want it this way."
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:07.480]   This is in Mesa, Arizona. A massive new data center that is about to be built will use a huge amount
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:15.240]   of water. And they use the water for cooling. And Arizona is not exactly a tropical forest.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:25.400]   1.7 million gallons a day, 1.7 million gallons a day of water to cool it.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:36.040]   550 acre feet of water a year. Oh, actually, ultimately it'll be 1,400 acre feet of water a year. That's
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:45.880]   325,851 gallons times 1,400. You can do the math. 500 million gallons of water a day or a year.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:53.640]   That's amazing. Just horrific. So it's not just the electricity. They're big environmental
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:59.560]   footprint for these things. Yeah. And recent research papers really put this into light that
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:05.880]   how much it really does increase the divide between so-called wealthy nations and so-called
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:14.280]   and less wealthy nations. And a nation like China or the United States, they can build up all of
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:20.360]   this technology. And it creates, build businesses that both increase their own
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:28.440]   country's domestic product and also create services and technologies that help people who have the
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:34.120]   money to spend on those things. Meanwhile, this creates damage to the climate. And historically,
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:38.520]   it is the poorer nations that suffer from climate damage first. And they're also the least likely
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:43.880]   to benefit from whatever new innovations are being created from these cloud facilities.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:51.320]   So it's given that we're all dealing with an unnatural 113 degree heat wave across
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.560]   everywhere. This is probably not the one, the thing that's going to kill our species is they
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:59.640]   got four people who are kind of scrambling ahead of it. But it's still something that we have to
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:04.680]   keep in mind that there are implications to all of this. It's not just electrons moving from
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:09.720]   column A to column B, it really is going to have an effect on disparities that we should be
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:18.760]   narrowing and not lightning. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Does this webcam look familiar?
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:26.920]   The bridge says it's just a great design. Dell's versatile ultra sharp 4k webcam looks a lot
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:32.120]   like the Apple eyesight. Oh, I thought you meant that tunnel thing from Star Trek that ate all the
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:39.000]   ships. That too. It looks like that too. Or maybe a Stargate, I don't know. Quick, get some whales
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:45.720]   and tell it. We want 4k. It's a cylinder. It's a cylinder. Yeah, I guess. But it also has the
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:51.800]   feature where you turn, I think where you turn the knob to close the shutter. That's a nice,
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:57.320]   that was a nice feature on the, I wish Apple would put better cameras on their computers. Maybe
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:03.640]   they will. It has the camera on the, the 24 inch iMac is a better camera, right? Is it 1080p plus
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.960]   Apple's signal processor, which is really good. Yeah. Okay, good. That's nice. Of course,
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:13.800]   this Dell camera is 4k, but a, okay. What do you need 4k for really? Well, it's only 60 frames per
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:19.320]   second at 1080. You know, you can't have it all. Okay. But if you think about it, it is Apple did
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:23.720]   solve quote, solve this problem in a way that's very typically Apple. When you give them the,
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.520]   the merit, hey, the, the, the webcam's kind of stink. And I know that the webcam's stink pretty
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:33.080]   much no matter what computer you buy, but could you make the webcam, the webcam not stink? And
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:38.200]   they'll say, how do you do? Can do? Be back with you in about a year. And you thought that you were
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:42.520]   asking them, please give us like a high, high definition camera. And they said, no, we'll give
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:46.360]   you like a camera that will, no matter where you are in the frame, it will automatically reframe you
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:53.480]   so that you stay in the middle of the frame. And then you pause and think, okay, I like that feature.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.720]   That's, that's useful feature to me. That solves problems that I actually had that forgot to ask
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:03.240]   about. And now I feel as though I don't have to give you quite so much guff about week,
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:08.120]   week low resolution cameras. Did we talk, remind me, because I do so many shows, sometimes I forget,
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:13.800]   did we talk about Tim Cook calling Nancy Pelosi last week? It happened last week.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:18.920]   We talked, we talked a little bit about the, about Apple and other companies reaction to the,
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.000]   those five bills that were being discussed in Congress last week. They're lobbying forward.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.520]   Yeah. According to a good morning, good morning. Good morning.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:33.560]   Let me tell you, Apple even put out a white paper. Why about why sideloading would be a terrible idea
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:38.120]   for this cute little family letting me. Side loading is not incredible.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:44.280]   And that's kind of what he told the speaker of the house when he called her according to
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:49.160]   the New York Times really sourced this one. Five people with knowledge of the conversations.
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:55.160]   The cook said aids listening in. Yeah, obviously, right. And he trust bills were rushed. In fact,
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:58.360]   it's probably leaked by Pelosi's office. I would get, I would guess. I don't know.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.080]   Given the tone of the meeting. Yeah. Right. I would say so.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.560]   They would crimp innovation. They'd hurt consumers by disrupting services that power Apple's
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:11.080]   iPhone. The New York Times added a little editorial in there. Apple's lucrative iPhone.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:17.880]   So this is of course part of the big lobbying effort by all of the companies.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:22.120]   Facebook actually lost a very important court decision yesterday.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.800]   As you may or rather want. Oh, no, no, they want. Yeah. Wrong, wrong choice of verb there.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.960]   We're not, we're not used to hearing that when it comes to anti-trust.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:37.080]   Facebook won a big one. The district court in Washington ruled that the lawsuit from the FTC
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:43.240]   and 48 states could not proceed because it could not be they did not successfully demonstrate that
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:49.800]   Facebook was a monopoly. The judge wrote, you act as if everybody knows Facebook is a monopoly
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:55.080]   and provided me with no evidence that it is. So I have to say you haven't proven your case.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:59.000]   Yeah. They didn't get to come back. The Bergh is a top hat.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.520]   He's wearing a monocle, your honor. Yeah. Clearly it's a monopoly.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:08.680]   The FTC does get a chance to refile. So it's not as though this this has ended.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.640]   But yeah, this this is frustrating because it's it really is like, do I really have to go into
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:19.320]   all the reasons why Carl is absolutely the worst and why I'm not inviting him to our wedding?
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:24.440]   Do I really have to do? Is it is or is it just understood that where he goes,
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:27.960]   chaos follows? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:35.560]   You know, I think it really more than anything else. It was the judge saying,
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:42.280]   you didn't file this case properly because job one is to is to prove that it's a monopoly so
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:46.600]   that you can pursue any trust action against them. And if you don't do this, and I think it's
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:52.680]   reasonable to say, look, yeah, you can't skip this. Look, there are other social networks.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:59.080]   Facebook is, I mean, it's dominant. It's big. But is it a monopoly? That's the game, right? Like
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:03.320]   defining the market is the entire game we're playing. Like by by some accounts, iPhone is
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:06.600]   not a monopoly because there's so many more Android phones. But amongst us teenagers,
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.760]   it has a tremendous share. So whoever gets to win the define the market game is going to be a big
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:15.000]   victor in the define the regulation game. This is why Apple is very, very grateful for Google's
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.800]   existence at this time because they can say that, well, no, we're not locking into we're not making
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:26.360]   our users. We're not forcing people to stick to to an app store. People want to sideload apps.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.680]   All they have to do is give up their $1,000 iPhone and buy an Android phone. What could be simpler?
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:34.440]   The judge, right? Seems like we even give you a bunch of money for it. This is good. This actually
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:39.320]   will be, I think, relevant to actions, maybe not in Europe, but to actions in the US against Apple.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.840]   And maybe we'll make the FTC think twice. The judge wrote monopoly power is,
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:52.120]   quote, the power to control prices or exclude competition such that a firm is a monopolist.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:56.920]   If it can profitably raise prices substantially above the competitive level,
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.480]   where a plane prices is an important word because Facebook is free.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.080]   It's everything. Yeah.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:07.240]   Where a plaintiff can provide direct proof that a firm can has in fact profitably done so the
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.720]   exist of some of the monopoly power is clear because such proof is rare. However,
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:16.920]   plaintiffs in courts usually search for indirect or circumstantial evidence of monopoly power by
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:22.200]   inferring it from a firm's possession of a dominant share of a relevant market.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.960]   And you have to abuse it too, I believe. It can't just be a monopoly because you're the only one
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.400]   who came up with the idea. You've got to like Nintendo can have can be the only one who can make
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:33.640]   switches because they're not abusing anything about being the only one to make switches.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:38.760]   So it is hard to say you can't say Facebook's raised the prices of anything, maybe advertising,
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:47.320]   but it's free to its users. But you could say perhaps that it's putting up barriers to entry
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:51.080]   for others into the market. And that's really I think that the case the FTC is making the
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:56.120]   buying Instagram and WhatsApp. Remember they went after Apple for books and not Amazon because
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:00.120]   Amazon controls both ebooks. They just controlled it like the arm monopoly for ebooks effectively,
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.560]   but the government was upset because Apple made prices higher. And that leads you to a bunch of
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:10.200]   things about price dumping as well or cost cutting or, you know, it's very complicated, but the
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.360]   the US seems to always want lower prices and the EU seems to always want more competition.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.800]   And then it would maybe benefit both to have a more well rounded view of the market.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:22.600]   Yeah, that's why these this set of laws that have just made the next step through Congress is so
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:27.000]   terrifying, excuse me, so dangerous to Apple and Google and whatnot because they add new rules to
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.480]   the system. One of them specifically saying that if you are a huge, huge,
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:37.400]   an enormous company that has the power to control your own control the market,
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:42.360]   you can't make you can't introduce products that can give those products on advantage over
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:49.240]   would be competitors. And this is the sort of thing that could lead Apple to no longer be able to
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:57.240]   bundle Apple music or the TV app or the TV app or the TV app or the TV app or the iPhone and all
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:02.920]   other devices. Because it's one thing to have the Safari browser, which you could argue doesn't
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:09.640]   really make Apple money and it doesn't cost Apple anything to have Chrome and other browsers compete
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:16.840]   and work on this. However, it is a huge, improvable advantage to say that is a user going to use
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.760]   this app that's already on the phone. They're already logged into their iTunes account because
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:26.600]   that was part of the setup of the phone. They're it's they've got like a free trial period that
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.840]   came with it. Are they going to decide that, no, you know what, I'm going to try, I'm going to give
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:35.480]   Spotify a try or I'm going to give a title a try. No, they're going to stick with Apple music and
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:40.840]   probably because most music services are the same regarding what consumers want from a streaming
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.680]   music service. That is probably where they're going to stay. So that's that's one of the areas
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:48.440]   where Apple is going to have big, big trouble if these flaws actually come into come into fruition.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:55.080]   And the judge the judge kind of spanked the FTC wrote the FTC's complaint says almost nothing
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:59.400]   concrete on the key question of how much power Facebook actually had and still has
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:05.000]   in a properly defined antitrust product market. It's almost as if the agency expects the court
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.200]   to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist. After all, no one who
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.520]   hears the title of the 2010 film, The Social Network wonders which company it is about.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:22.920]   He basically encouraged the FTC to refile with more specific monopoly.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:27.160]   It's really interesting because these questions are like just like like the technology questions
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.440]   are so new and it always takes a lot of time to catch up. And one of the ones I've been wrestling
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:36.200]   with over the last week is that I would very much like gatekeeper and sideloading on the iPhone.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.080]   But when I started talking about it, I got so many comments on both sides of these issues
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.520]   that had to take a step back and say, well, I just think of everything as a traditional computer.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.200]   So is that my world space and there are people who hate traditional computers
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:52.280]   and bought the iPhone the way they buy an Xbox and not a PC gaming thing? Because the last thing
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.520]   they want is to have to worry about traditional computing. And then I was like sort of thinking
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:01.400]   about like choice because Apple phrased this in an interesting way. I thought like, is the choice
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.960]   on platform or between platforms? Should you have the right to sideload on every platform
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.600]   or should you have one platform that offers sideloading in one doesn't? And which one of those is real
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.960]   choice? Like if you make every platform sideload, if there are people who are adamantly
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.560]   don't want that because they consider that an exploit or a potential problem for them,
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:22.200]   they no longer have anything they can go to. The same way if you said every Xbox has to run
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.920]   full on Windows, they would have no recourse if they just wanted to get a darn gaming console.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.200]   And I think these are like no right or wrong. I think anybody who says you're absolutely right
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:35.080]   or absolutely wrong about this lacks nuance and empathy. But I think it is a very big discussion
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:39.640]   that we need to have as more people start using computers who aren't computer users.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:46.200]   Well, and the other interpretation which members of Congress and law professors have taken from
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:52.360]   this judgment is we need to rewrite the antitrust laws they haven't kept up with technology. They
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:59.800]   are not appropriate to the kind of businesses we now need to regulate. Representative Ken
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.040]   Buck, a Republican from Colorado from the New York Times and co-sponsor the antitrust bills
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.240]   says today's developments in the FTC's case against Facebook shows that antitrust reform
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:14.360]   is urgently needed. Congress needs to provide additional tools and resources to our antitrust
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:19.560]   enforcers to go after big tech companies engaging in anti-competitive conduct. So that's the risk
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:26.440]   to Apple of course is that these these this will just strengthen the move in Congress to
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.840]   change the laws in such a way that they can go after Apple and Facebook and others.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.680]   Yeah, and unfortunately they don't even have any friends. It's starting to look as though they
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.920]   don't have friends in the Supreme Court either because the few cases that have come through that
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:44.200]   you might think would be relevant to figuring out are they predisposed to breaking up a big
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:49.560]   company or are they predisposed towards preserving a successful business. It's that they have been
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:54.760]   leading towards well no this is we are we are we are siding with the consumer we're siding with
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.360]   the marketplace over this one specific big business. Let's take a little break we'll come back lots
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.720]   more stories less serious I think to talk about in just a bit Andy Enoco Renee Richie great to have
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:12.520]   you guys. As I mentioned at the beginning of the show Alex had to bow out because of his bandwidth
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.400]   he's had a family reunion which is great so I'm glad he's spending time with his family and not
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:22.680]   with us. I think I think I think his family just like bought one of those like illegal jammers
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.560]   we want to have his attention for the entire family reunion. What I have to do office hours
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:35.320]   is hold an anti radio box that's looking beside it. Our show today brought to you by active armor

[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:54.440]   collection band ordered two of them immediately did you is there one for Canada yes so here's
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:59.800]   Australia these are the colors oh and you got South Africa Australia Belgium Brazil

[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:26.440]   abstract and very large you know like like the Australian one is I think they went after like
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:32.600]   sports colors because the Australian one is orange and green and the New Zealand one is all black
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:36.360]   yeah which makes a lot of sense if you know what rugby or soccer I like the great Britain one one
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.520]   half of the band is blue one half is red you've got the colors of the union jack that's actually

[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:45.080]   France maybe they have a special window for the American band
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:58.040]   there it is that's nice that's nice red white and blue on the both the band and the watch face is
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:02.680]   cool are you gonna use I guess you have to use the watch face right if you're gonna wear the band
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.880]   I mean yeah and they're downloadable which kind of opens the world to a whole bunch of you think
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.920]   obviously they were all hard-coded and you know like can I kind of get a they're not gonna give me
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.560]   an air mass face if I buy an air mass band are they are they are they Nike face if I buy a Nike
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.280]   I mean yeah like like this is a whole new kinds of customization I get this in time for the 4th of
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:27.160]   July I think a mine is coming July 6 I think is that I would have for Canada day one's Canada
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.240]   but they've done these before July 1st they've done these before but they were only for the
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.320]   Olympic teams like they were only for national teams you couldn't get them commercially oh Apple
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.920]   gave them out so this is the first time and it's different from Apple because previously they've
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.760]   used beats to do the all like the Olympic and team stuff they've never done that on the main Apple
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.200]   brand so it's interesting to see them get into this kind of stuff and I wonder if they're gonna do
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:51.080]   more of it and these are the sport loop bands so they're the velcro yeah I'm sorry hook and loop
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:55.960]   yeah it can looper bands oh yeah so they're like the sweatpants the sweatpants of apple bands
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:03.000]   who has it quoted you it was so cute as Renee Richie calls them the sweatpants of apple bands
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.960]   of that oh that's nice that was very sweet you're famous now you're famous for that
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:13.960]   infamous infamous when you're gonna get your own band like you know like like like Yeezys
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:19.640]   when you're gonna get the the the Rizi the Richie for man he Rizi I like it I like it
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:26.680]   Xcloud can now be played officially it was in beta but is now official Microsoft's streaming
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:34.280]   gaming service can now be played on iOS and Android in Safari let me let me just fire this up here
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:39.800]   I am I have to say maybe because we're in the beta and everybody's trying it
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:48.120]   it's a little bit choppy right now this is on our we got about a four or five hundred megabit
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:54.200]   connection right now which is pretty darn fast let me see if I can play Sea of Thieves I'm using the
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:00.280]   ready to play what does it say tap to start playing okay there we go
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:08.200]   I'm using the Xbox controller which is a Bluetooth controller to pair it will work with a variety
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:14.040]   of controllers oh it doesn't yes there it goes see if they are you getting the audio John
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.480]   doesn't look like you're getting the audio because the audio is nice unfortunately you were getting
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:30.200]   it earlier huh there we go hear that choppy I was getting that at home too so it's probably
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:37.560]   these are running on apparently Xbox blades in in Microsoft's network centers but you're not going
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:44.200]   to want to play the game like this the music will drive you crazy alone brothing pains yeah it may
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.040]   it may merely be that there's so much interest in this now that you can do it on an iPad I mean
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.680]   what a great way to make an iPad a gaming machine or a Mac too by the way it'll work on Safari I'm
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.200]   still so salty that Apple won't just allow it in it's like not it's like so short-sighted like
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.760]   not allowing Netflix on 10 years 10 years ago it's just like no Netflix you have to put every
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.760]   one of your TV shows and movies inside the iTunes stores we can individually rate them it's just
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:10.200]   absurd let me press the player sorry bothers me I want to I want to play all this time I'm
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:15.400]   I'm totally with you it's like I kind of feel sorry for a person who has to be a spokesperson
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:21.240]   and make that statement and pretend like it makes any sense whatsoever please don't ask
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:26.120]   a follow-up on how this is protecting our users how is this protecting our users okay I quit
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:33.080]   it'd be such a value add to because my apples gaming story is at best incomplete at the moment
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.800]   and having all of these streaming services would be such a boon to gamers any time especially
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:45.480]   especially with the with the iPad line you they've got they've got thousand dollar tablets that are
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:51.640]   trying to compete with superb thousand dollar to two thousand dollar the same price windows tablets
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:57.960]   and if you can just simply say the things remove reasons for people to say I really want the iPad
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:03.400]   but gosh it doesn't do gaming or gosh I can't run I can't run this window app in this in this
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:09.160]   virtualized shell I can't do this simple things that are like this doesn't hurt you at all apple
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.880]   this doesn't protect the consumers it doesn't protect your market you you basically just have
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:19.480]   this rule and you have some yours yours because you are a huge huge company you
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:26.680]   unavoidably you have people who join the company to enforce rules that they didn't create and they
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.920]   are not doing their job if they don't enforce this rule and that's why they're doing this because
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.960]   nothing I'm saying you're right this is silly we're going to change this rule it's like nope
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:40.200]   that my job is to say no this isn't the stuttering we're seeing is by the way is not us it's uh yeah
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.600]   yeah there is an on-screen controller a lot of the game they do offer some games in the x-cloud
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:50.520]   subscription uh with touch controls but I have to say this is gun playable right now the way it's
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.480]   it's it's every second it's pausing or something I don't I don't know if I can make this better
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.400]   maybe it works better on the Mac uh it is currently a good time to try because it's one buck a month
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:09.400]   for the first three months uh but then it'll cost you um whatever x-box game pass costs I'm
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.960]   wondering if it'll smooth out what the game starts playing. It was a video last night um from
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:17.560]   viper with the community manager for x-box game pass and they went over all the different like
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.520]   plat like ultimate passes and all the different features you get with all of them and the ultimate
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:27.320]   one looks like if you want to do everything yeah best bet yeah you can try it out now I've been a
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:32.040]   x-box gold never for a long time with my x-box I was really hopeful that I'd be able to
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:39.480]   with yes you get it all if you if you pay for the the full thing but uh I'm disappointed by the
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:45.560]   the streaming I hope it gets better soon uh still it gets technically a beta but it's an open beta
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:51.640]   now anybody can join it so you'll need an x-box account um and they should have soft tested it
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:57.800]   with classic x-box games like original x-box games now streaming and the x cloud beta and then everyone
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:02.600]   could have played like the Hulk smash game for a month and it helped them test it yeah it's interesting
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:08.520]   that they they uh you know I mean the theory is great and uh stadia's stream is a little bit better
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:16.040]   I have to say uh stadia has worked all right maybe because nobody's using it possibly right um uh
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:22.840]   I g-force now I've used on uh an Nvidia shield and the streaming is is very smooth so I'm just a
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.120]   little disappointed this isn't working quite as well as I'd hoped I leave you can't use stadium
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:31.720]   Montreal out of solidarity for Jade Raymond so that you know it's aww she's she landed she landed
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:37.400]   quite well she said who did I just saw she got a new job but I can't remember what it is escaping
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:43.240]   me too she was the ubi soft director who took a job at google best known for helping create
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:50.760]   assassins creed and watch dogs she then moved to um stadia where she
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:57.000]   lasted only a few months she uh now has a she's founded a new independent development team called
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:04.040]   haven entertainment studios with Sony interactive which is in Montreal it's in your your network
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.320]   Montreal's a video game community yeah we have the ubi soft absolutely
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.160]   mythic quest talks about Montreal all the time with fear and bread which is how we want to be
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:17.240]   perceived yeah no no word about what the game will be but uh she's got a blog post at the play
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:23.560]   station I just remember uh watch I watched the lab with Leo and call for help and electric playground
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:29.320]   so I these are all the people I grew up watching on television as a kid so I did have career I did
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:34.920]   have to commend Jade Raymond for her excellent taste she she says several people who asked me
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:38.920]   recently after all these experiences do you still want to be in the games industry the answer is
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.560]   always an unwavering yes the games industry is where I belong whether it's playing settlers of
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:53.480]   katana with my kids or valheim with my team double thumbs up games continue to bring me joy so
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.880]   I'll be very interested to see what she does she's created some of the most amazing games and it
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.840]   was a was a great catch for google but clearly google's changed its uh plans they didn't want
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.800]   to they decided not to develop an internally well it's it's it's been a complete mess over
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:12.520]   there this absolutely no reflect everything everything everything and everything and it
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:17.240]   does has become and I'm glad I'm glad she's heading her own studio because this is she's
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:22.200]   exactly the sort of person who should be here's a budget here's an office here's a budget for snacks
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:28.520]   hire some people go go be it be awesome check in with us occasionally good news for m1 mac
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:39.080]   users linux kernel 5.13 with support for the m1 there have been people have been able to install
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:48.440]   nix on the m1 mac but now having a native I would imagine would make that easier um yeah and that's
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.480]   actually a lot more important than a lot of people realize because the number of people who do
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:57.560]   administration and web development who they they would love they want to they want a mac book but
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.680]   they also want to be able to use all their favorite environments for development and unix
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:08.120]   linux basically solves all those problems claryce has added apple silicon support to file maker
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:13.080]   i'm really glad file makers still exists that's an excellent database a really good way to do
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:19.480]   custom software they've added microsoft edge integration and server enhancements as well so
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:26.280]   claryce which was spun off of apple and spun back into apple they purchased the company that
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:35.720]   created file maker but file maker 19 version 19.3 is out with apple silicon support i have to say
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:43.400]   i it was kind of a red letter day yesterday on my m1 mac as i do periodically i launched the
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:52.600]   activities monitor to see how many intel processes were still running on my m1 and it was zero zero
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:17:00.120]   uh almost air well yes everything i use now has been ported over to the m1 including a lot of the
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.680]   things that were running in the background that were kind of annoying me things i actually took
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:09.240]   steam off because that still was in tell but uh there were things running in the background that
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:15.400]   i just didn't want i didn't want rosetta to be running at all if possible so m1 has really made
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   some great progress in the seven or eight months it's been out yeah that's that's something that's
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.040]   probably unique to apple they have the ability to they have the ability to really force something
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:29.080]   down developers throats and just say look this is this is what the future is going to be you can
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.360]   either be part of apple's future or you can be by the side of the road where there's no cell service
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:41.160]   and nothing uh and if you want to live come with us if you don't want to live fine don't don't
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.200]   update your apps it's when you look at what what uh how many restarts apple excuse me microsoft has
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:51.320]   had to do with windows how many plans they have made and had abandoned quickly because they just
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.920]   got no support whatsoever uh for for this thing and microsoft is is a two trillion dollar company
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.720]   they're huge they're not like i'd also ram uh but apple only apple has the ability to say this is
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.720]   where the ship is going you can either jump off the ship or stay on the ship this is the cost of staying
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:11.080]   on the ship there is no start button would be apples answer i love it because wall street journal
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:17.640]   uh joanna stern was interviewing microsoft ceo satin adela talked about a lot of things windows 11 and
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:25.160]   so forth uh he'll she asked him uh about integrating microsoft software and services with the iphone
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:30.840]   he said because because joanna's a a mac user we'd love to make sure that it works better we do
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:38.120]   everything we can like anything apple wants to do with windows rather its itunes iMessage whatever
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.120]   we welcome that yeah i don't think apple's gonna be an apples like we've heard of windows yeah we
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:49.960]   i don't think we're doing windows messages for windows which is too bad steenen justine and jenna
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:54.920]   had panels pene on their show really he's just he's so jeff goldbloom he's just so quirky and
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:00.280]   interesting in the way he approaches any question i could watch him for hours yeah don't expect to
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:08.920]   run windows 11 anytime soon on anything other than the pcs uh microsoft has said that windows 11
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:17.960]   will not be supported by any intel macintosh at all so it has to use secure boot and uh now
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:25.640]   that's by the way i should have needs tpm yeah i have to say this is a story in flux uh because
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.200]   microsoft's taking a lot of heat because of the minimum hardware requirements for windows 11
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:37.000]   including this trusted platform module this intel yeah uh security device and i wouldn't be
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.520]   surprised to see this change over time but right now it looks like without tpm 2.0 you're not going
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:48.920]   to be able to run on that it depends i mean and microsoft they just have not got their stuff together
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:53.880]   dependent regardless of how big an update this is uh they first they said that here's what you're
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:59.960]   gonna have to have in order to run windows 11 then they said well if you don't have it then you can
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.280]   run it in an experimental or you can write you can install it anyway and if there are problems
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.920]   we're not gonna be responsible for it uh in the meantime uh i think i've been reading on reddit
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:13.960]   people who have claimed to have installed windows 11 on max i think someone even said that they
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:19.000]   i've saw someone claimed to have installed it on an ipad even got a point out though the only
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.800]   version of windows 11 people have is a leaked build that is very old and i i just i think that
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:30.600]   it's premature to make any statements at this point at all exactly for now uh windows 11 requires
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:36.680]   tpm 2.0 apple does not support that on its intel max it's possible apple could do a firmware update
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:42.040]   to their intel max that made it work i don't see why they would since they're facing them out
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:48.280]   um on the other hand at microsoft's moving along very quickly with windows on arm in fact
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:53.960]   they've just announced uh support uh for windows on arm for uh microsoft office which
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:58.600]   probably you know they've been supporting m1 with microsoft office already so i think that
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:04.120]   probably the future is moving more towards m1 and away from intel no matter what
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:07.080]   yeah uh not just in the in the apple world
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:15.560]   uh let's see what else what else is going on have you tried any of the uh new betas the beta 2 is
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:20.200]   out for monoray rene have you tried that all of them anything all of them and there's new betas for
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:27.800]   ios 15 as well these are not the public one so yet right no those although those are often based
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:33.160]   on the second or third uh developer beta whichever one proves to be more stable so it could be
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:37.560]   i last year it took until july to get the plug beta but last year wwc it was a couple weeks later
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:43.240]   so this is usually around the time you know this week next week uh let me start seeing them new
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:51.640]   hello wallpapers and screensavers uh available to all hello hello hello yeah um actually actually
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   going back to windows 11 they did one thing they absolutely support they they have them
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:02.200]   an amazing an amazing collection of wallpapers for windows 11 and i did download the entire
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.200]   collection and they were beautiful i've got one on my ipad and it's like oh my god that's
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.640]   beautiful they really are pretty well you know what they're very much inspired by apple
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:16.200]   yeah i think but wavy wavy stacks of colorful paper yes exactly very pretty let's let's say let's
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:21.880]   say they ripped off the same independent artist that apple probably ripped off that were hired yeah
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:28.600]   probably the case yeah um i don't what does it stand as a bootcamp on uh m1 maxes it also
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:33.240]   doesn't exist right there's no boost down there's no there is no bootcamp you know what do you want
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:38.040]   to run windows on that for run linux well so you know like like the people who are way smart on
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:41.240]   us and by that i mean the people who are in high school and college we're running windows 11 in
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:45.080]   parallels last night on twitter you know so they just they doesn't matter nothing stops them i
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:51.560]   should correct myself that microsoft has released uh windows 11 on the developer channel for insiders
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:57.800]   as of yesterday so i don't know if that's what they were using i don't think that it developers
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:03.640]   build is very different from the leaks build as far as i know but i haven't tried it yet thank you
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   do it in our chat room for a while you know christina warren will figure it out i want to take a few
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:16.680]   days somebody um foundation we have a date september 24th that's not very far foundation a premiere on
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:24.840]   apple tv plus there are at this point apple tv plus we talked last week about all the second
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:30.200]   seasons and so forth but this is the the very important turning point because at this point
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:35.880]   it's not free anymore so it'll be very interesting to see if they can come up with stuff to keep people
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:44.040]   uh subscribed 25 daytime Emmy award nominations recognizing the long way up ghost writer helpsters
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:48.920]   still water helpsters help you i don't know any of these here we are notes for living on planet earth
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:55.320]   uh never heard of any of these helpsters is the sesame street for co- these are kid they're
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:02.360]   announced okay kids shows daytime programming uh outstanding travel adventure nature program
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:06.200]   long way up outstanding short form children's program for helpsters help you
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:13.160]   nice not nine uh nominations for ghost writer
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:20.360]   so a good job apple i guess it when it comes to awards we'll see when it comes to subscriptions
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:28.520]   the the award that really counts yep yeah there are two kinds of currency uh three kinds of currency
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:33.960]   there's money there's pr and then there's prestige apple can definitely give them two of those they
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:40.920]   can hope to give them a third good news in the the uh ios 15 beta you developers apps can now ask
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.960]   for more memory remember that was uh something that the the ceo procreate said oh man i can only get
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:52.680]   five gigs of ram even on a 16 gig ipad pro well an increased memory limit is now available
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:58.840]   with the os proc available memory function and so this is part of apples new beta
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.720]   uh that's good news yeah it's it's an interesting conundrum because very very
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:08.680]   according to developers themselves like when i was on alex's um panel we had people from um
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.160]   luma fusion on saying like we don't really need that much memory on ios and i think people
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:16.600]   forget that they're fundamentally differently engineered than a classic computer right there's
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:22.360]   no there's no paging to memory there's no swap so if you have like two side-by-side apps and they're
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.920]   beefy apps and then you have like a wind like a video window on top of that you have the new notes
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.080]   thing on top of that you have like sliding over all of those need to be in main memory and that's
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:36.440]   why the ipad is so fast so like you might have eight gigabytes or 12 gigabytes but two or three
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:40.920]   apps and you're starting to use that and starting to get some your older apps right out of memory
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.840]   which you might not like because then you have to reload them or reload all your tabs all the time
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:48.680]   so it's a very different balancing act but i think this is a really good compromise and i know some
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.320]   people won't be happy until an iphone or an ipad does swap like a mac and there's reasons they
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:58.120]   didn't do that historically just for memory and for over rights and for a bunch of other reasons
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.160]   and maybe they need to explore that but i think this is a good middle ground where an app can
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:04.920]   ask for that entitlement and if that app really is going to do things like extra layers or like
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:09.320]   alex is going to have photogrammetry is you know it's buns off for for a few hours and you're really
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.480]   focused on that and you're not jumping around between apps it'll just give you all the memory
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:17.880]   that the system can can possibly give you and then when you leave you're signaling that you want a
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:22.200]   multitask again it's going to just reduce the memory requirement uh and that that's a good best
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:27.080]   of both world scenario i think for now at least yeah absolutely you hate to you hate to for something
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:33.000]   again especially some of this as expensive as an ipad pro that can do the thing that you needed to
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.880]   do but but if not if not for this limitation that was artificially imposed upon it just like you'd
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.040]   like to be able to say override please give me more memory please i i don't want i don't want
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.840]   to run other apps i don't care if i'm keeping these other browser tabs open i just need you to do
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:53.560]   this one thing for me right now right here give me as much bandwidth as possible so i can string
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:58.840]   from this camera uh over through the internet so yeah that's i i like every single time you see
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:02.920]   one of these evidences that apple appreciates that they are charging as much for the top of the line
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:09.560]   ipads as for almost a top of the line windows windows the windows machine these days and so it
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:15.480]   really has to earn its coins there it's also interesting to me because it's such an apple solution and
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.320]   they do this all the time and sometimes it blows up in their faces and sometimes it's really smart
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.640]   like back in the old days with ios 4 they're like we want multitasking no you want to surf
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:28.040]   safari while you're listening to handora okay here's your api and here's like we want swap and
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:32.440]   they're like no you just want to be able to have as many layers as you want in in in procreate here's
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.880]   your api it's always been the problem uh it's an unproblem on the radio show you got to ask the right
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:43.320]   question you shouldn't you shouldn't you know when you go to a repair shop you shouldn't tell the
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.000]   guy what's wrong with your car you should tell him what the symptoms are let him figure out what's
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.840]   what's wrong right there's a solution you want tell him what you have i have a hyperactive
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.640]   thyroid doctor no no just tell him the symptoms he can figure that one out yes but but but on the
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.760]   other hand when i when i when i complain that wow why does this why does this huge tablet not have a
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:05.560]   headphone jack the correct answer that i'm looking for the answer the answer i'm looking for is not
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:11.400]   but we decided to give you the best bluetooth connectivity possible saying again i know it i know
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:15.720]   what bluetooth is thank you i would like to be able to simply plug in a headphone jack it drives me
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:21.320]   crazy sometimes and that that does apply to other things as well there i i mean i i in the same in
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.440]   the same show i praised apple for uh saying well gee i want a better webcam and they said well
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.760]   gave you better webcam we didn't we didn't decide to give you more resolution we decided to give you
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:36.680]   ai-base will follow you around the room uh but sometimes don't try to enter don't try to interpret
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.720]   i get hey wow things are connected other things like it's like apple apple got a dose of this with
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:46.920]   their with their with their their compute centers it's like no we didn't ask you do this the cheapest
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:52.520]   way possible i know you think that that's doing your job well and you're being really clever by
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.880]   saving us some money and some complexity but we're telling you what we as a company want and need
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:02.680]   from your products and or services and we are wondering why you are arguing with us that we
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:09.880]   don't actually want the things that we actually want um i think we got everything in here do we
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:16.280]   want to do rumors mark german says apple is exploring future ipad designs with larger screens that is
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:25.400]   about the softest rumor you can have yeah 2023 yeah yeah exploring big deal uh i i phone 13 pro
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:32.120]   will feature ultra wide lens with autofocus coming to regular models next year again it's a rumor
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:38.280]   uh i guess we're getting closer to the iphone 10 or rather the iphone 13 release so yeah maybe
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:43.160]   those rumors will start because i love what apple's doing according to john prosser apple is making
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:50.840]   some employees where body cameras police grade body cameras to to keep from uh releasing uh
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.920]   any uh information look at that that's one of the things that doesn't get a lot of attention is that
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:59.000]   like uh oh i like i understand like different people leak for different reasons sometimes a
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.680]   manager makes a decision you're unhappy with and you run you can usually tell because that manager
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:07.800]   is named in in the in the leak at that point or or you know people are super excited and they can't
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:13.640]   help but tell somebody but it makes life for their team so much worse every times there's a big leak
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:18.360]   it just becomes harder and harder to do your job and i get that you're excited or you're or you're
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:22.360]   peeved but and i like reading luke leaks you know as much as anybody else i mean it's like movie
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.760]   leaks it's all the same stuff it's not it's not serious whistleblowing like there's a a dump of toxic
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:32.120]   chemicals somewhere this is just like leaks about products like story leaks it just it makes their
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.560]   lives so much harder every time body cameras are just like a step beyond from the ib it's unclear to
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:44.440]   me is it the employees in kubertino or is it the employees in the factories unclear to me here's
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:49.800]   the here's a page prosser claims is from a manual given to apple employees getting to know your
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:56.440]   axon body to camera um and by the way he says apple employees were warned not to leak that they
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:03.240]   were gonna harm its employees with body cameras uh and that not all and the reports is not all of
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:07.720]   them just people who are i'm i'm sure that if you if you take a ride in an apple car you're probably
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:13.640]   going to be weird that makes sense or in the design if you go into the design labs yeah i guess that
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:18.360]   makes sense and it just comes down to the thing is you promised not to you you sign something you
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.800]   promised people that you are not going to talk about the stuff that you should that you see
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:26.120]   when you're working at apple and so for that reason you shouldn't do it that the thing that got the
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:32.920]   kind of got at my nose though was uh kind of what this story shook took loose was uh apple uh actually
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:41.320]   taking sending having their lawyers send warning letters to uh people outside the united states who
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:45.880]   are passing along leaked information threatening them saying the information you pass on about
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:51.160]   unannounced apple products can give our our competitors an unfair an unfair advantage can
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:55.400]   damage our business and we want to warn you and they're just scaring people off they're not
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:32:01.240]   to not just the people who are writing blog posts but also uh the usual work around when you get like
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:06.200]   pictures of uh of uh the upcoming apple headphones obviously you're not going to run the picture
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:10.200]   because you'll blow your source so as a result you hand it off to someone who's really good at
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:15.000]   product rendering and they will create a render that sort of sanitizes the image so you can't notice
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.760]   where it came from so they're actually they're even sending the letters to those people again if
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.080]   they're outside the united states and why only to the people outside the united states because they
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:28.520]   know that they will never get away with that basically you if if so many united states got that letter
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:33.400]   you would make a nice video about it make a nice blog post about it problem frame it put it on the
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:38.440]   wall and pointed it and left and really it kind of offends me that apple would even try something
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:46.600]   like this because what they're actually saying is that on some level this is what this is what
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:51.320]   journalists are supposed to be able to do that if they feel if they got access to a piece of
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:55.080]   information legally meaning they didn't pay some they didn't pay an employee to give them the
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:59.720]   information they didn't coerce them to give the information if they just simply said hey my dms
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:05.000]   are open and someone decided to put a pdf file in inside uh they're in a link to a dm
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.600]   with all kinds of information about the next apple watch they're 100 free to to post that
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:14.520]   information and do whatever they kind of do whatever they want with it and for apple to
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:20.760]   assume that to presume that no we can we own all the information the press has absolutely no right
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.800]   to say anything about anything that we're doing that we don't actually approve them to release
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:31.720]   it really does be speak of an attitude inside of apple that the press on some level are just an
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:36.280]   arm of apple's marketing department they are not allowed to do anything that apple does not like
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:41.960]   or is inconvenient to them and that that really kind of got up my nose you're referring to a
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:52.120]   letter received by a chinese leaker kang from a apple law firm saying don't you know don't release
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:55.800]   that and uh he actually there is a chilling effect and you know remember we have a first
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:00.840]   amendment in the united states i doubt there's a first amendment in china yeah again this way
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:05.160]   the way there's there's free press outside the united states of course they're protected speech
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:09.480]   outside of the united states of course the only real difference is that we also have in the
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:13.800]   constitution that you can't make a law that limits free speech or the free press right that's the
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:17.800]   difference between us and most of the company can sue sue you i mean that's completely legal
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:23.240]   that's not they can they can intimidate you but that they even they even there you're not going to
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:28.360]   get any traction whatsoever this is i could you can you can dial a one eight hundred lawyer
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.680]   and give them a case of beer and they can get this thrown out of the united states america
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:40.360]   the thing that has a 97.1 accuracy rating on apple track but it's all last minute like he would do
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:47.000]   it the night before yeah yeah uh on wibo but he he leaked a lot of stuff that he's leaked is
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.040]   quite accurate so the thing that's fascinating to me is that my mark german leaked a memo about
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:56.280]   people getting fired for leaks that were based that were leaked to mark german and now john prosser
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:01.880]   has leaked uh this chest camera that being imposed because of people who leaked off to him it's like
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:07.160]   this layer of meta that i just i'm not ready for in the leaker community so just to make this
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:12.920]   clear i'm not a fan of rumors and leaks mostly because a lot of them are wrong and and it seems
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:17.640]   like it's it's really all about seeing who can be the first to say something whether it's true or not
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:23.800]   but on the other hand i think it is an important uh role for the press to play if it helps people
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:29.400]   make buying decisions i i understand i don't want to i don't want to ruin apple's surprise nobody
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:34.040]   does wants to do that but if if you're about to buy a laptop and we think apple's gonna release a
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:39.240]   laptop in two weeks that information is useful to you and so that's what uh i think a free press
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:45.160]   does that's important yes and to like layer me into that too because like you sorry any go ahead
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:50.040]   i was i was gonna say to me it's just not even as complicated as that it's that look you don't
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:55.320]   get to control what other people say about you if they got that information legitimately this is not
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:00.440]   this is a solved problem this is a known thing this isn't someone doing using technology in a way that
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.360]   that has never existed before well but that's the question they got it legitimately do they
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:10.520]   get it legitimately if it's leaked from an apple employee is that legit if apple if apple can
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:15.240]   prove that that prosser anybody else was saying hey i'll give you a free mug if you give if you give
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:22.600]   me a render of the new headphones or any or anything of that of that way sure they can go some place
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:28.360]   with it but again all if all i'm doing is saying here is my dms are open or here is my go go to
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:33.800]   tip somebody send me this or whatever yeah their your hands are absolutely clean and if you don't
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:39.560]   i mean this is the you could you could have even received excuse me you if you had if you had the
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:45.320]   iphone four that was famously left behind at the bar if you were if gizmodo had been smart and
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:49.640]   talked to their lawyers before talking to the responding to that email they could have worked
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:56.200]   out a way that said that we will never take receipt of this property that doesn't belong to you however
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:03.320]   we will we will pay you for access to this device inside this hotel suite after you sign a bunch of
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:08.200]   documents you we will it's still yours you're taking it it's we're not taking possession of it
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:12.920]   then again you're just doing fact gathering you're taking advantage of their mistake i don't i just
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:17.880]   don't like the the impression that apple says that the only people who are allowed to give us to give
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:21.720]   information before something's released are the people that have signed ndas or the people that
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:28.280]   we have just chosen to be an unnamed source for because it behooves us at this point to have this
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.720]   information out there without us having to actually lay claim to it it's also so wily not your puppets
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:37.320]   now we're going to get it we're also going to now we're just going to get a bunch of of body cam
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:40.680]   footage leaked you know it's just going to be the perfect source of all the next oh yeah that's a
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:45.480]   good idea that's a great idea the thing that so like i agree with like a lot of this but it
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:50.840]   apple is incredibly logical company they don't do a lot of really weird things and any of us who
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.920]   have been covering apple for a while can probably tell you with a fair amount of accuracy there's
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.600]   going to be another iphone there's going to be another macbook this is probably the usual
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.600]   increase like just based on pattern analysis over the last ten years we can give you fairly
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:06.920]   accurate predictions about what apple is going to do next across a wide swath of products we don't
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:12.440]   really need leaks for that kind of stuff so to me this really is just like tv show or movie spoilers
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.080]   some people hate them you don't look at them some people want to know instantly every bit of news
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:20.840]   and there are people who really get off on giving people the news first because it gives them fame
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:24.840]   attention and inside companies because they know it was them outside companies because they get
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:29.720]   all the hits or the or the views and that's just a culture that's always going to want to be fed
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:33.560]   so i i totally agree with andy but all the journalistic stuff like you have an absolute right to do
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:38.840]   all of that but the culture is endlessly fascinating to me but i don't think it's critical for us to
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:44.040]   do our jobs in terms of informing consumers about buying decisions we could not get a single week
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:48.840]   again and we could all do that job really really well i think yeah no absolutely it's the but that's
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:53.720]   the the point the only point that i'm making is that that is an individual journalist and i will
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:59.400]   use a wide explain why definition of journals even if you're just someone who just is just posting
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:04.280]   on waybo or whatever versus someone who's working for the wall street journal that's our that's our
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:09.640]   choice to make that's not apple's choice to make i i'm with you i'm i'm very very but i have it's
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:16.040]   been a while since i've been offered a really really juicy tidbit about like an upcoming like a
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:21.480]   key apple product i mean i mean years but even back then even like 10 years ago it's just not
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:26.360]   interesting to me it's like okay so great so now you have what you claim to be a render uh eight
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:31.000]   and not 10 months in advance of someone that something that could easily change at any time
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.200]   that doesn't affect anyone's life doesn't even really affect the product i mean it's not if it's
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:41.320]   working conditions inside factories great no definitely that's that's something that's actually
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:47.800]   important but this is just in a way i think that stoking the fires with these rumors is kind of
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:52.840]   doing apples apple p r apple apple's apples marketing division their job for them because
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:56.760]   we're getting people to think oh let's get people excited about the iphone 13 by speculating that
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:00.360]   it's going to be a perfectly round phone and you'll be able to you'll be able to
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:07.320]   whenever whenever the battery gets low it smells like an english muffin with a cinnamon on top of it
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:11.800]   and get people really excited about it i don't know that's not a bad idea though i like it
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.600]   right before the battery ignites oh if someone's baking an apple pie

[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:49.400]   i have to mention this i you know i it's kind of silly but somebody has made
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:58.760]   it's a ipod dot j s a javascript uh ipod that you can you can log into your apple music or your
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:04.280]   spotify you have to click the buttons and click the spin the track wheel and everything just
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:11.320]   just like just like you would on a uh on a regular so it's a little funky to use
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:15.720]   but if you want a music player that reminds you of how good see i'm trying to click see i'm trying
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:21.880]   to click the you can't you have to scroll down you have to use the use the scroll wheel that's
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:28.920]   intent that's integrity that's integrity and then you can't just click the buttons you have to select
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:33.960]   the button and then click the button in the middle yeah though this is actually the way it works
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:40.520]   it's pretty cool uh just wanted to mention this is uh they call it ipod dot j s but it's at tannerv
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:46.200]   dot com t-a-n-n-e-r-v dot com slash ipod free to use if you want a kind of nice
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:54.200]   player for your mac and tush or your ipad ipod dot j s that is integrity right you want it but
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:58.200]   the problem is you want to touch or click those things you can't you have to scroll them i bet
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:02.360]   well i bet i bet i bet the touchpad on your on your on your macbook would work maybe it would
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:09.480]   yeah yeah sure would yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't have any music on here unfortunately right
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:16.040]   i would place them for you i have to admit that i've i kind of miss that real really tactile interface
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:22.440]   of of a music player and having the actual device in your hand yeah and and know that wheel it was
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:26.600]   always great it's designed to be nothing but a music player i i still i still use my uh my sony
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:32.200]   digital walkman the a 55 that i got last year uh and it really is a different maybe it's maybe
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:37.880]   it's because i am like again gen x i didn't like grow up with with the with the iphone but there's
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:43.480]   something about no this is the device that has like all like 800 900 my albums albums in it
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.840]   when i shovel play it is shuffling through every track i have ever bought ever and if i want to go
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:55.160]   to the next track i don't wake i don't wake it like do do touch id and then tap like a next button
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.240]   there is a clicky button with little little bump on the side so i can find it by touch i touch it
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:03.400]   and suddenly i'm listening to dolly partons jolene instead of whatever it was supposed to be totally
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:07.480]   that's why i think that's why they went back to all the switches and knobs in star trek because
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:11.400]   with ambient computing they just needed something tactile so they said you're going to put clickers
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:15.560]   on everything else right the computer is vocal but everything else is going to be a big clicker
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:19.080]   all right now i now i have to try this i'm going to sign in my apple music here
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:25.800]   roger would occur leo give us some roger would occur face there's a ship place safe and ready on the
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:32.280]   oh look at this oh you all look at this there it is there's my cover flow remember cover flow
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:38.440]   wasn't that cool yep oh man oh cuz you have to scroll through it look at that i don't know if i
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:43.400]   don't know if you got the k-tell instead record click i sure do let's play that funky music here we
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:48.360]   go let's see how it sounds so good at making everything sound amazing look at that it's playing
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:55.480]   look at that all right it's even in stereo ladies and gentlemen
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:02.520]   buy this person of coffee or something just clever i want i want to give this person three
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:07.640]   dollars and seventy eight cents or whatever because just for the having all the we all have these
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:12.040]   really cool weird ideas not all of us say you know what i'm actually going to do it look i'm playing
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:21.000]   brick on an ipod on javascript on my linux box now that somehow even this is also screwing
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:30.520]   steve wasne a 500 dollars oh hey hi oh all right andy your pick of the week uh one of my favorite
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:36.840]   things ever the prop store is a on is an auction site and a store that just does auctions of really
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:41.160]   great high-end like memorabilia collectibles that sort of stuff we're not talking about cards and
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:45.320]   comic books we're talking about original movie props going from like original star wars light
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:52.440]   sabers all the way to like costumes from from casa blanka and they have a really massive auction
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:58.760]   right now that is filled with name any sort of science fiction or fantasy property of the past
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:03.800]   20 30 years they've got stuff from it they've got stuff from forest gump it's such a really great
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:08.440]   how far idea of stuff and the reason why i'm calling this out is not because like anyone can
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:15.800]   probably afford like 250 000 300 000 dollars for indiana jones hat from the first movie but
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:20.280]   you can download the pdf and keep it and just reading through here it's just a photo auction
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:25.560]   photos of all of these amazing props this is the abyss helmet and it really looks like it's been
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.280]   worn i mean this thing's beaten because it has that's i i i i singled out a few of the
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:35.480]   a few of the items from here i i i had a single out the dive helmet because that is the one
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:41.160]   per piece of movie memorabilia that if i could afford to buy it i would love to have because that
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:45.720]   was a i love the abyss i think i think it's my favorite james camera movie one of my favorite
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:51.160]   movies period and because they were shooting this diving movie like practically not only did that
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:56.680]   have to be a cool looking the work the helmet it had right how to keep these people alive at 50
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:03.240]   50 to 60 feet below below the water level for like 10 to 12 hours at a time so it was all functional
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:10.680]   all practical and it is that beautiful harmonization between let's make this a real like a construction
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:15.480]   dive helmet doesn't have that much glass you can't see that much of the people's faces it may not
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:20.280]   even have that kind of lights on it or microphones in it but they had to make it work for for filming
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:24.120]   but it actually worked so they have they have the helmet that's like supposed to the auction
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:28.520]   estimates about 3000 they have like the the air supply backpack they have one of the missiles
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:34.600]   from it they but there's a lot of different stuff uh i think the raiders lost ark stuff i already
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:38.600]   they started the auction started today i think the hat went for like a quarter million or
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:43.720]   oh yeah yeah yeah but they also have like weird like one-off stuff like you know the scene in
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:49.400]   being john malcovich where malcovich walks into like a restaurant and everybody is john malcovich
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:55.400]   so they have one of the john malcovich masks they put on the extras available for auction and
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:00.760]   i may imagine the crimes you could come up with by saying who was it it was john malcovich but
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:09.080]   maybe from 1992 not from not from today here's a here's a bloodied costume from the 310 de juma
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:16.280]   russell crows costume look at this this is amazing yeah wow i'm i'm not even halfway through it it's a
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:21.720]   two-day auction but this so not only not only for this auction but also there are a lot of auction
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:27.000]   sites set the bees to uh the profiles in history where every time there's a new auction i will
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.760]   download the pdf and put it on my ipad because this is just like the it's it's like a free free
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:38.600]   800 page coffee table book in which all the all these props that you got to see for maybe eight
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:43.000]   seconds in the background you can take all the time you want and there'll be a description that
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.760]   explains exactly how it works and what is working right now sometimes it's horrifying because it's
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:55.480]   like uh it's like a an adorable creature from uh from uh teenage mutant ninja turtles but it was made
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:59.480]   out of the the mask is and stuff are made out of latex and foam rubber so it's now this sort of
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:06.840]   like dried leaf that kind of looks like Leonardo yeah like it was buried in a shallow grave and
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:13.160]   just discovered like 13 years later these are going for pretty good prices too who gets the money for
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:20.200]   this uh people who are putting up these auction lots of the uh adam savage on the tesad.com channel
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:24.360]   has been featuring a lot of these things and oftentimes it is like as someone who worked on the
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:30.120]   special effects who still has like one of the macquets that they that they took home after or
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:34.440]   after the job or here's something that nobody wanted uh and sometimes these things have been
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:39.160]   floating through collectors hands time and time again and now the wheel is the wheel is stopped
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:45.400]   and i was going to be spinning again look at this austin powers blue velvet suit and green shirt
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:50.440]   i think uh i think dane should buy this used to be awesome powers every
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:56.520]   halloween i think it really up is up is game here baby baby really it really is great i will
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:00.760]   i will not i'm sure that i will be able to afford one of those helmets but with all of the it's
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:06.200]   you get pictures of like the entire of the helmet from all angles welded so if i ever like the one
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:11.320]   really complicated cosplay that i would ever like want to invest the time and actually making if
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:16.200]   ever did would be like one of these dive suits from the somebody spent twenty thousand dollars
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:23.480]   in this alarm clock from the dashboard in back to the future yep twenty thousand dollars but you
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:27.960]   you'd have to be a serious fan you'd have to be a serious collector but again the pdf is free
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:33.000]   they also do things like the the prop newspaper from when like biff and his gang in the future got
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.920]   arrested so so so now you can actually zoom in that would be awesome yeah and all the articles and
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:43.800]   i'm always so impressed because like you'll they have the newspaper article from the godfather when
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:48.920]   don corleone got shot that was the headline and no they had someone write actual stories it wasn't
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:53.640]   just dummy text someone had to write a news story about the gangland shooting in the background
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:58.840]   who's suspected so like i said this is this is nothing miracle and it's yeah and it's great value
[01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:10.280]   for money wow uh shimps sunk by whales since 1979 uh wow president says she's tired queen diana will

[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:05.240]   there are themes uh they got the youtube version look at that huh i should play some youtube
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:12.520]   i hear let's scroll all the way down remember this oh it's not getting past be
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:16.600]   oh remember when everyone got a free youtube album and they were really upset about it yeah
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:24.040]   for it at all i remember that look at that this is uh this is uh this is awesome seriously awesome
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:31.480]   all right mr rene richie your pick of the week so mine is is really fun there's a really talented
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:36.120]   youtuber uh it has a channel called nothing but tech her name is jackaland dallas and she
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:40.840]   created her first product uh today she announced it and it was just it was just nice to see
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:46.840]   you know people being creative and industrious and it's these cards uh and it's not a non-nft cards
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:54.040]   nbt nbt no nbt is her channel and these are i'm blank on technology it's not bluetooth it's
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:56:01.400]   the thing you tap um nf no uh i'm blank on the name lio the radio nfc nfc yeah there's two
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:06.440]   many acronyms too many initialisms well they're nbt cards for nfc so i understand you're confused
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:12.200]   yeah these are tapped to pay cards they're pretty they're tapped to inform so like you can
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.840]   program them with things like if you're at a conference and you want to give someone your
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.520]   web address or your instagram or your twitter that's me you can just tap it to their phone and
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:24.840]   their browser will pop up and it'll be full of the age so these are basically nfc tags they used to
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:30.600]   be all the rage but now you can carry just nicely designed cards and then and uh she's doing a
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:34.440]   bunch of designs that are meaningful to her channel but also just really nice designs in general
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:40.120]   uh you know she had me at cold brew basically i like that cold brew so the actually you know
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:44.440]   nowadays probably you could carry this in your pocket instead of business cards and just people
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:51.480]   tap their phone to it and it would uh send over your vcf uh virtual yeah card or your your way a
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:56.280]   lot of people have uh web pages that have all their links yeah now as well and oh that's really cool
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.040]   for them and you don't need to spell things you don't need to type them out you won't need to
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:05.160]   you know no no my name is two c's and a k in it you know it's any of that kind of stuff so it's
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:10.680]   just it's and it's clever it's really nice you can even uh you can even uh share 32 megabyte files up
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:16.200]   to 32 megabyte files on it so let's get some storage so it works with hydrine us only for now
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:19.800]   she is working on expanding it us only for now though and she's going to do different designs
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:26.120]   every month so you can you can find very cool what is her channel about it's technology review she
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:30.920]   does really good especially android photography based reviews like the different camera systems
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.880]   on android phones but she does like a wide range of apple and android uh year reviews nice very
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.040]   thoughtful and she has a really good video about facebook i think we talked about a a month or so
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:44.280]   ago with a lot of really good animations and stuff and it to explain how everything really works when
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:52.200]   it comes to data sharing nbt is her channel and this is at tap.dive.fyi i guess dive is the technology
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.760]   yeah these are dive cards so that's cool very nice i didn't even know about this i think i'm
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:04.920]   gonna get one to carry my pocket for my business card save tree for sure i wasn't just that i was in

[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:50.280]   little more expensive to benefit her but not much couple bucks more but she's great she's worth it
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:55.720]   she's worth it that's awesome and it's look smart creators thinking of really cool useful products
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:59:01.800]   yeah yeah yeah nothing but tech baby thank thank god you told me that was cold brew because i

[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:23.560]   near Rhode Island you got to drink coffee milk ask rich to tell you about coffee milk i think he's
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:29.480]   in a clip sky i'm not sure any of the riches ask your doctor ask your doctor about coffee milk
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:36.280]   he'll tell you don't drink it he'll kill you but it's sure good free base it you just got you just
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:41.400]   got to balance it out with enough delves lemonade so to get to uh love delves lemonade is out your belt

[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:08.520]   them a tip from a of a dollar and i will be much much refreshed very very soon the battle of course
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:14.760]   between uh the dueling coffee milk brands is autocrat versus eclipse but i'm glad to see you can
[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:21.640]   now get autocrat on subscribe and save on amazon so i may be uh i maybe oh this has got to be so
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:26.680]   bad for you uh leo why are you so excited today no reason no no no no no it's not the coffee it's
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:30.760]   the sugar you know these things have just make sure just make sure number one ingredient high
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:37.160]   fructose corn syrup number two ingredient corn syrup have you even watched hooklin nine nine leo
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:42.680]   uh no but i know that's the end of it right is the cold brew the cold brew thing yeah yeah no you've
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:46.520]   told me before i gotta watch this yeah kind of watch that's exactly what's going to happen to you on
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:51.800]   this stuff you gotta be careful it is only a hundred calories per two tablespoons serving so
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:57.080]   i don't you probably use more than two tablespoons per glass however yeah it's important it's important
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:00.680]   that you dilute it with coffee don't just don't drink it straight out of the bottle just just
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:06.040]   just a cannibal it's drinking directly oh wow look at this they definitely know their audience
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:11.480]   frequently bought together autocrat coffee syrup del's lemonade natural gift bundle and iggy's
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:18.280]   clam cake mix this is the Rhode Island bundle right there everything you need to have for
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:25.640]   providence this is terrible i'm like i might actually buy this just autocrat is the official
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:33.320]   state drunk coffee milk of Rhode Island according to autocrat i like that phrasing but the state
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:41.800]   drunk coffee milk i don't even know if that's correct or just uh somebody's misinterpretation
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:46.680]   what kind of what kind of sashantiar do you get for the official state drunk the official state
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:51.400]   the coffee mill of the official state drunk is that what it is maybe that's what it is i don't know
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:56.440]   you need a semicolon you need punctuation there just to make it really does it have enough coffee
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:03.080]   to get a small wake up joke ask somebody two tablespoons has a mere 14 milligrams
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:10.600]   uh i don't know eclipse has a little more so maybe maybe go with the eclipse if you really need the
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:16.600]   degree it less cracks me up it's mostly corn syrup with a little bit of coffee
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:26.120]   andy and akko what are you going to be on gbh next i'm on friday at one p.m go to wgph news.org you

[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.080]   this week next week i think it's typical timing for them is usually once once we get to this phase

[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:18.040]   ipad os on my ipad pro yeah if it's real life ipad os has been springboard crashing a touch more i
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:23.160]   had a single springboard crash on ios but ipad os i've had a couple but nothing major they're working
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:27.320]   well i just can't wait till enough people i know have them so we can do like the share play
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:34.040]   stuff like the face time screen sharing so much cool stuff yeah i just had this other problem
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.720]   that you know that you and Andy can identify is that is i have people in my contacts i can't show
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:42.200]   and ios is now so show everyone in your contacts have you that it's really hard to get screenshots
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:49.880]   for a lot of these downloads now so i have to figure that out uh okay folks we've come to the
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:55.720]   conclusion of mac break weekly i know it's hard to believe but it's true um we do this show on
