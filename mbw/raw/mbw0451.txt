[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.680]   I can't believe you find that depressing
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.240]   It is a little bit must be must be sleeping in the growth. I believe somebody told me
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.240]   I don't know if they're a punky me or not, but sometimes when you shave your head they said it never grows back and I
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.000]   Wow, yeah, it did grow back and it's grown back. It's almost now to the normal length
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.920]   In fact, I actually have a on my to-do list and make an appointment to get a haircut. Oh go on rub it rub it in
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.320]   I'm sorry charity. I'm sorry. Good to see you though. Also with us today. Mr. Alex Lindsey
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.960]   Where are you calling us from coming in from Pittsburgh Pittsburgh PA?
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.160]   He's in Johnny Ives white room actually. It's more of a more of an ivory today
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.680]   Yeah, the live today. Yes, and of course from Montreal Canada and I'm more.com Renee Richie great to see you
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.240]   Felilio Salugue. What?
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.520]   How are you Leo? What did my ears just go out or did you speak to me in some sort of Star Wars language the language of your people?
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.840]   Have you been watching Star? Did you watch all six movies back to back all three all three movies the unmolested versions? Yes. Oh
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.720]   Now we know where you stand
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.140]   I never realized that we talked I think we talked about this last no we know what I wasn't here last week by the way
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.200]   Thank you Andy for hosting doing the hosting chores for me
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.680]   I don't so maybe we didn't talk about it, but
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.920]   There this whole thing about going back to the original and is fascinating to me
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.520]   But so you only accept the episodes four through six is the canonical story. Well, the other ones are just different
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   I just I just classify them as something different. They have a different purpose. They have different sort of
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.720]   They're they're different the jar jar euro. We call it. Yes, of course. That's the one that Alex Lindsey worked on
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   I just want to point out excellent specular highlights. Yes on the princess Amadala's
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.280]   Starship ship is peerless. Yeah, see there. That's all that's all I need
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:48.760]   Are you amazed Alex by the the lengths to which these fans go to create the canonical versions
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.720]   This is the video that he put up on YouTube. I don't you know
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.240]   There's been people re-edit and edit and there's been there was the you know
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.680]   There was a there's been a couple different edits of some of the a variety of these and
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.560]   I don't I don't actually I'm not that surprised if people make their own Star Wars movies
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.360]   Yeah fan fiction, but the point here and I think actually if you look at this video
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.640]   It's pretty well taken is that the Blu ray, which is what we're getting
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.720]   I believe in the digital versions really the color correction was terrible
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.560]   I mean look at the how the blue the red magenta hues the cast
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:33.680]   And then the despecial what is it called the despecialized edition? Yeah, that's what we're looking at which is an attempt to get back to the original theatrical
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.320]   1977 release and the guys using so many interesting techniques somebody told me he got a job
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.760]   out of this
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.960]   Because he's so good. He's doing rotoscoping at the Moss I see
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.660]   Bar scene, you know as they go into the bar. There's a
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.800]   pathetic CGI
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   And the other question is how do you get back to?
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.960]   How do you get back to you know the fact that Han shot first? That's what they're trying to do so they're using the 77?
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.000]   There isn't a print Lucas has kept the prints out of circulation, but there there are laser disc right laser
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.760]   There's a laser disc which I own I you know I didn't realize look at the differences. There's some huge differences
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:21.920]   So this is actually fun to watch that these specialized if you watch the Blu ray versions the original special effects hold up really
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.680]   Well, but the CGI they added looks terrible now. It looks like doom from the 1980s because it was done in the 1980
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.240]   Or was it the night? Well, it depends on that which which CG I think that the space shots actually look fairly good. Yes
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   But the animals look horrible. Yeah, I mean I think that that was still kind of a
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.720]   Work in progress on some of those, you know those were all done in the late 90s
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.760]   And yeah, you know I think that we this was pre-habit pre you know a lot of those things
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.680]   You know I think that the the stuff that what you what I noticed a lot
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.040]   And of course the stuff that I was I didn't do but I but I definitely saw a lot of it getting built was
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.360]   you know a lot of the space shots and and
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.600]   I thought those if you look at the dynamism of a lot of the the moves and shots and everything else
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.320]   It was much more impressive than than the original the original the problem you really got into with
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.400]   Just to get a little geeky for a second the problem you get into with the original
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.200]   Tifighters and and X wings was that
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:22.600]   Those would be three of those guys flying would be literally 14 passes of film that they would go through to
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.780]   Comp it together to pull it all together and every time you did that you would scratch it
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.200]   So if you you only got one or two tries before you had to start over again like literally reshoot everything all over again
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:39.160]   And so you get to a point where the scratches are worse than the then the then the actual effect and so when we got back to digital
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.400]   You know it allowed you to do things over and over and over again
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.480]   And so I think that the you a lot of those kinds of the hard surface effects
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.480]   I think in the in the re-releases were you know the stuff like the ships here?
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.440]   I think we're I think very impressive. I think that the
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.360]   Characters yeah, we're still a little challenged because I think it was still work in progress
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.520]   Have you seen the new robot though, right? Yeah? Oh, yeah
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.320]   When the trailer came out they said it was physical and I was like there is no way man
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:13.400]   But what you know and I guess the one that was done actually for the movie was a bit more of a prop
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.080]   You know that was rotoed out, you know, so it did it wasn't what we have now seen its celebration
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.960]   Which is kind of running on its own. It was still a bit of a prop that they had to fix up
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.320]   But they actually have a patent for BB-8, which I think is hysterical. Yeah
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.400]   Sfiro we know sphero because we saw them at Mac world they make a really interesting thing
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.280]   So I've talked to father Robert who I believe is gonna build this
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.040]   For and maybe we can enlist you Alex because he says he can build the mechanics of it easily
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.000]   But it's the paint job. He can't do so maybe we can enlist
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.320]   Unless you I have the perfect people for that. Yeah, I figured you yeah, so because I don't be painted but distressed
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.880]   No, no, no, I what you want is the get guys that actually worked, you know on the film so
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.000]   So what this what this is apparently I'm told by Robert we've I think with
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:12.720]   Looking at the patent they figured out the the big ball the bottom of BB-8 is independent roles and in like a segue
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.760]   Balances and is controlled
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.060]   And and and then it has with the giant sphero, isn't it? I mean it's a giant
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.480]   It's a giant sphero. Yeah, and then within it as furo is this cool thing now
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   I think I have one we have to find our spheroes and then within it he believes there's a rod a magnetic rod that doesn't exist
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.720]   This is what's interesting that top part is completely independent. You could pull it off
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:41.040]   It's not attached in any way be levitating. It's magnetic. There's a magnetic rod in the bottom
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.880]   Larger ball that the magnets in the top part position center themselves over
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:53.480]   So when you control the bottom ball you also control you see that the independently the position of the top piece the top piece
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:59.960]   Obviously has to also spin. I think that's controlled by the top is a magical. It is a really wonderful effect
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.400]   They're gonna sell it as a toy
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.720]   And like that. I don't we live in wonderful times
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:14.840]   Amazing all I can say is that I I want that and I think about everybody who's seen it is gonna have to have
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.920]   If it works at all if it gets reviews that it worked at all
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.400]   Everyone's gonna have to have one well it and so this is footage
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.680]   Maybe you haven't seen from the Star Wars conference recent footage like like a couple of days ago where it comes out
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.440]   It says hi it rolls around our two detours there and it is it's real. It's not fake
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:40.120]   So what I what I love about this is that JJ Abrams who could easily of CGI this or puppetry this made it
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.040]   That's to me. That's a good sign. I know people are worried about like like a lot of the sets though
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.200]   Some of the images that have been released from the sets they actually built the you know
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   Much of the craft and it's yeah, it's
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.160]   In the case I think they might have gone a little overboard on some of the stuff with the epic with the other episodes
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.920]   But you know there were some pretty big sets built for I know yeah
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.120]   Well, so I mean, you know, so that's that you do want to create that scale. It's very hard to do that in CG
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.240]   When it gets too big a lot of times are set extensions, but
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.320]   Yeah, they do painted planes for the extra stuff, but they're shooting these at the Elling Studios
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.720]   We were there's a lot these are big giant sound stages. It's like a magsafe head. Yeah
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.640]   It's a magsafe head
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.400]   This is so awesome. That's all I got to say by the way we can confirm that the new magsafe adapter and the new Mac powerbook
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   13 is much sturdier
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.040]   The magnet is like much you have to work at it to get it off
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.920]   So good news Andy will be happy about that the magnets on some of the watch traps are incredibly strong
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.940]   You've been you've been now to the Apple store. You've seen you've watched
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:49.720]   I've seen videos are in photos from you and serenity trying them on and everything. Yeah, are you excited?
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.680]   Yeah, I mean I've gone several times now. I went to the Palo Alto debut
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   For the try-ons and they had a
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.720]   You know, I can't believe you came down in fact
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.400]   I saw the picture we talked about this of you and
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.560]   Dow rimple talking to Tim just standing there like regular guys talking to Tim Cook
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.000]   I wasn't expecting that I was talking to Jim and then Tim came in from the back of the store and then said hi
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.080]   Hi, Jim. Hi Renee and we and he knew you what we ordered he didn't have to be introduced
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.160]   Yes PR people so I don't know they think he's probably briefed. He might have a little
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.600]   He's I'm more
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.140]   Like it just taps out the person's name on his wrist to the right. It's mr. Yep Jim Del Rimple
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.180]   He said to him is hard to miss though and Jim's yeah Jim's very distinctive
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.840]   Wow, I mean that was pretty neat. That must have been awesome
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.320]   Did you actually interview him at all or just kind of we just spoke for a few minutes
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.520]   He was saying how much you love like using it for sports and athletics the same kind of things you said before but it was
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.600]   He's very gracious and he comes off. It's incredibly passionate and sincere which is the same way it comes off on his talks
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.680]   Yeah, it's kind of neat because I mean he has his talking points
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:56.100]   but they they cut he and I don't think he's an actor so that gives me gives me some sense that he's genuine in his
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.600]   Appropation now and it wasn't just us you went around and spoke to customers at the store as well
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.040]   He took about half an hour
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.520]   Steve used to do that that was his story the Palo Alto store used to do that love doing that
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:12.320]   And I think Tim knows that and this is kind of as much an homage to Steve as anything else Steve would have loved to have been there for that
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.440]   I'm sure yeah
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.200]   So I I'm a little concerned
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.680]   Friday April 24th we're recording this on April 21st so Friday three days away four days away
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.040]   Usually by now I would have had a happy go lucky text message from Apple saying good news
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.680]   Your watch is on its way
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.820]   Half an alpider has you said serenity has
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:46.040]   Senator got yeah a couple people people in the US who ordered the aluminum ones who had April 24th as their early shipment date have been getting
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.040]   I don't know they've got actual notifications, but their status has changed on the online order
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:56.240]   Okay, mine is and I'm looking now. Did everybody get April 24th through May 8th? That's that was the so just
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.040]   Yeah, only those are ordered in the very very first
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.840]   You have few minutes of the ordering process it rapidly changed to like four to six weeks almost oh yeah
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.160]   No, but I ordered in the first few minutes. Oh, I okay little 12 10 I think
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.040]   What time was it? Yeah, so that's probably too late, but anyway, it says delivers
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.760]   24 but to five eight, but it also says
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.080]   processing items
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.560]   so
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.800]   I ordered stainless steel and I ordered a 1201 and it said
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.560]   Between mid-May and late May Wow, so I was lucky well, you know what that's what it said to mine too on the 42 millimeter
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.680]   But the 38 millimeter. I'm gonna get the little one
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.720]   Lisa's good. It's actually Lisa's just gonna let me use until on the bigger one comes a few weeks later
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.800]   So into the mines the 42 stainless steel with the millenese loop and that's still that's still down for
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.320]   Friday till the week after they're dropping shipping from China as usual
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.720]   There's staging in the US I believe I think if they've moved a bunch of them to the US
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.000]   I think rumors wrote about that
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.080]   They had a source that said a bunch of them had been moved to the US to get ready for the shipping for Friday
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.480]   So chatroom I got a ship notification from my watch charger
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.960]   It'll arrive tomorrow
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.520]   My card Kalan says my card has been charged the status has changed
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.400]   Tripod says I got a FedEx tracking number for Friday tripod
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.720]   What does it say is the origination of that because usually it'll say shun-jun China?
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:28.840]   But so this might confirm that story that they are there in fact staging from the US and would reassure me because if they're staging from the US
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:35.280]   They could reasonably think it still says China because I've done that before and it still said country of origin on the shipment
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.280]   Oh
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:43.280]   And if you paid with Apple pay some people have gotten the Apple pay billing has gone through oh I should check
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.960]   How do you keep a how do you keep a moron and suspense?
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.920]   I'll tell you
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.160]   Right after this no, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.880]   They're keeping me in suspense. So none of you. I just want to check
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:03.320]   They've gotten no no July. What's it gonna be in the UK? Is it different in the UK?
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.600]   It
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.960]   Well as far as I know no one in the UK's had a shipping notices yet
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.080]   But on Twitter people have said there's a rumor that possibly they go out tomorrow
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:19.360]   Also had another guy on Twitter say that in Australia they get this they get the shipping notices like the day before so
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.720]   There's still hope but it depends where they're coming from I suppose if they were coming from China to the UK
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   It's gonna take ages, but if they have got some here
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.920]   Hopefully they could actually ship them out in a couple of days. We should we'll soon find out
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.960]   So the thing with the watch is that we waited for that we waited for one event
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.860]   Then we waited for the second event and we waited for the try-ons are waiting for the shipment and the delayed shipment
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:45.520]   Beyond say got hers in fact. She got one that no one else has this is a this is a gold
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.440]   Link band there. She is in her private plane
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.680]   She gets an exit row every time and
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.320]   There's the that's pretty
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.400]   Taking with a gold but with a gold strap now I might be interested then it's but I'm not interested
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:08.320]   Well, let me think how much that must have cost hey Don if you could reconnect. I think we're getting a lot of noise out of your
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.680]   Okay connection
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:17.160]   Yeah, that's one of the bands they haven't announced publicly yet there was a few of them
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.280]   They've shown off now
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.120]   I think a red one a yellow one a dark blue one the gold one that they are just not publicly available
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   But they're giving out too
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.400]   And this is I think something you get from some of the watch designers and Angela errands and so on
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.120]   So forth of the kind of the classic fashion rollout
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.200]   Which is that we're gonna show you things that you can't even own right now
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.760]   And of course you're gonna want it and then you're gonna spend $30,000 on it or whatever
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:47.800]   I mean this is we've done some streams for fashion shows and you definitely see this kind of build up of of the process
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.440]   So it's very very classic, you know more fashion industry than tech industry tripod says that his
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.240]   Went through Canada first that's got a really annoying
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:04.560]   Well, I ordered the black stainless steel and I knew going in that that one was not gonna be available right away, but
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.400]   It reminds me that story when you look at Beyonce's watch there's a story that you know everyone drinks the same
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.880]   Coke from the janitor to the president of the United States
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.600]   It's all the same coke. It's just the glass that you drink it in that varies the can all the same Apple watch
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.160]   Yeah, these are all the same Apple watches
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.040]   It's just mine is gonna be you know an aluminum or stainless steel someone else is is gonna be in a lot of gold
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.440]   Yeah
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.080]   God, I just you know I and I even I don't even I feel bad
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.920]   being you know wanting it and being and worrying about it
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.120]   It's like come on. There's so many more important things in the world than that
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.840]   Make that bigger here
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.320]   And come on Beyonce really
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:52.080]   Now I think now the interesting thing Beyonce of course and Jay Z her husband
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.400]   are publicly announced supporters of
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.480]   Jay Z's
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.640]   Record or not exactly record label or streaming music service title and I gotta think
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:10.720]   That Apple's sending out these really extra special ones to woo these artists over to beats
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.320]   I think I think they're looking directly at just influence
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.440]   You know seeing these great cool artists wearing the the really high-end watch
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.440]   I don't think they I don't think the marketing is connected to beats
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.480]   I think they're just really they want the cool kids to be wearing it
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.160]   By the way Beyonce is in fact not drinking the same can of coke is you and me
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.600]   She's drink the same can of Canada dried ginger ale
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.160]   Just so you know
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   Carl Lagerfeld had the gold watch with the gold link bracelet as well and he was there was a picture of it
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.240]   But he was still on the setup screen. So it looked like he hadn't even paired it yet
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   But he was still wearing it
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.440]   For me, I don't know what to do
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.840]   I'm seeing the diamond encrusted one. No
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.000]   There's a there's a there's one that they've already started talking about
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.800]   I guess they're gonna do as soon as it's released
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:06.480]   It's the gold watch and then it's diamond encrusted all the way around and evidently I think the the street price is
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.160]   117,000
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   Same watch same glass, but I'm sticking with my good old Republican cloth watch the Moto 360
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.920]   I'm I'm gonna be a man of the people the plebeians the plebeians
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:30.840]   Although Android is Google's clearly stung a little bit by the fact that the Apple watch and its first weekend outsold all the
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:37.360]   Ever and I think that what's interesting about this is also at a price that was two or three times what they were selling it
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.560]   I mean, that's the real insult is that is that you're really talking about something that was sold that that you know
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.440]   Everyone's worked really hemmed and hot is it 200 is it 300 and Apple said no?
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:51.720]   It'll be like 600. I've averaged yeah, you know like you know that that's what we can and we can sell all in a day
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.000]   What you sold over a year at three times the cost. It's quite a
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.120]   Quite a juggernaut Google has announced that we don't know it's not clear. Although some have said
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.360]   The current watches will be upgradable others have said that's not true that they're going to support
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.720]   Wi-Fi just as the Apple watch does they're gonna take it one better though as long as your watch is online and your phone is online
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.640]   Even if they're not in the same locale or the same network they will talk to one another
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.440]   So that now I don't know when that's coming, but that's an interesting
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.040]   There's a I have a pebble and I've used a moto
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.340]   And I've used one of the Samsungs and when you when you actually go and pick up an Apple watch the build quality is there
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.160]   They're not comparable like the other ones look nice when you just are looking at them
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:37.840]   But the build quality of the Apple watch the materials the finish all the stuff that Apple's famous for it's a huge difference. Yes
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:44.320]   I think the other haptics things as well is that fairly unique for the Apple watch because I've only used the pebble and that sort of
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.400]   vibrates, but I think the you know the ceramic back with the sensors and the
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.240]   Taptic touch that they're gonna have I think that's gonna be interesting to see how people actually
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:59.320]   Either enjoy or dislike that particular aspect. Yeah, it's gonna be very interesting, isn't it? Mm-hmm
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.000]   Yeah, well, I mean I want to try it I
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.880]   I you know, I'm I'm ready. I've got my iPhone all
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.800]   polished
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.680]   Just what the camera at your watch and pair it up
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.960]   And I do think that this is going to be good for Android
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.080]   I think that you know, there's a lot that Android's going even though that they've been stung by this a little bit
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.400]   I think that there's a lot of
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.280]   Advantages because there are gonna be a lot of people that don't want to spend five hundred dollars on a watch and they're gonna get excited
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.400]   And we're gonna see new they're gonna see the possibilities
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.600]   And of course there'll be a bunch of Android developers that develop something very similar
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.960]   But you can do it for a lot less money has to be really frustrating though, you know
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.840]   I mean they do everything you can first Samsung to and Apple just waltzes in and says yeah, we'll take it from here
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.640]   Well, the interesting thing though is is that they're gonna gain critical mass very very quickly
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.760]   And I really see like the second phase of the Apple watch being you know
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.920]   once as early adopters get them and we start to use them and then the developers start to tweak the
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:01.440]   Applications because people use them in real life and then you know third party manufacturers start to realize that there's this huge
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.400]   critical mass of Apple watch users who have you know this physical
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.600]   I think the physical interaction is going to be the big thing that will finally sell it to to the masses when people start
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:17.480]   Seeing people pay for things with their watch and when they see people start opening doors with their watch and you know interacting with the car and stuff like that
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.480]   I do think Apple will have the critical mass to actually
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.880]   To generate third parties to get more involved and to start to create a physical infrastructure
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.720]   That actually interworks with the Apple watch and at that point then it I think it will really take off
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:39.000]   I thought it was interesting that Microsoft I guess has made it available PowerPoint is you're now going to be able to advance slides
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.200]   That's what I'll watch is for
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.680]   You see a lot of guys that present
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.740]   You know you present a lot and I present a lot of slides and I don't know if you present a lot of slides
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.640]   But I present a lot of and I thought oh that would be really nice not to have something that I'm constantly
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.520]   You know one of these you know that I'm constantly setting down somewhere trying to figure it out
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   I've just been able to tap my watch while I'm talking
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:06.240]   Do you think the Apple watch will follow the same path at the iPod followed where you have the first edition?
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.160]   And then you start doing colored editions, maybe there'll be a swatch
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.360]   priced Apple watch and and that's a band with no watch
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.440]   But I don't know if Apple is really interested in that that almost like the iPod shuffle version where there's no screen
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:26.040]   Stuff they could they could do the fitness tracking things the way that sort of the iPod shuffle did a very specific
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.920]   subsection of iPod functionality, but I don't know what their interest level isn't in that because they've
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.680]   Since the iPod they've been more about making computers more personal not necessarily just doing devices
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:44.760]   I think then I go ahead. I was just gonna say on this Instagram photo of Carl Lagerfeld's watch that has not been set up
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.000]   Just cracks me. Oh, yeah
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.320]   It's just like well, you know, I don't know how to use this but I'm gonna wear it because it's a true fashion statement
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.160]   That is I can afford a $50,000 watch that I don't know how to use
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.240]   He probably didn't use a watch before that of course
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.760]   Oh, they're probably all or ornamentation for him anyway, yeah
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.160]   And then you mentioned Tim here's the picture of Tim's
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.400]   Sorry, you just got the red the Tim's with the red crown
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.920]   Yeah, mm-hmm. That's that's kind of interesting. He's wearing it. He just has a prototype
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.320]   He's praying the white floral elastomer. Maybe the red crown is like the ones that they
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.520]   See the employee on the ones that match the the gold edition with a
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:32.320]   Brown isn't there yeah, yeah, he's wearing the wrong band. Yeah, well, he has a stainless steel watch
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.760]   He's very he's an operations guy. He's very practical. He doesn't have a good one
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.040]   You know, I think that that's the right message to send what's not
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.320]   Well, it's like we talked about this before where it's like Jeff Williams who's the vice president of operations drives a 10 year old
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:50.520]   Toyota or or Honda or something. They have very different priority the Apple watch nano. I like that idea the shuffle
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.960]   Now it's much cheaper now with analog hands
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.000]   analog watch
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.480]   Gruber has an interesting article on daring fireball. He talks about
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.440]   discovering it's so funny discovering
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.160]   face or repo calm
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.780]   Which is and I've been using it for a long time
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:15.320]   Which is the place where you can get custom watch faces for Android where and there's some very cool ones
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:24.040]   Although he mocks it and and writes in a Paul Apologia for Apple and why Apple will never offer custom faces one reason good reason
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:31.240]   Because of the OLED screen on the watch you kind of want to choose faces that promote battery life
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:38.640]   In other words with a lot of black and he says there is a custom design in a sense because the Mickey face must have been
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.120]   Design in conjunction with Disney licensed. Yeah
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:50.880]   But he says the ten different faces which are almost not quite but almost infinitely customizable with what Apple calls complications
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:57.000]   Are likely gonna be that way. He says there's no way to set up a watch face
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.440]   It's ugly or doesn't look very Apple watchy
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:06.360]   And I have to say one of the things about face or repo is you can get an ugly a very ugly face for your Android where watch if you wish
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:11.720]   He says I don't see that this by design. I don't see that changing
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:19.760]   He quotes Andy saying in a tweet like what if Apple said we don't trust you to choose well designed iPhone wallpaper and
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.680]   Groober points out you I don't have to imagine that until iOS 4 in 2010 you you couldn't choose the wallpaper
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.640]   on on your iPhone
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:34.040]   That I think is the most apt part of that because originally they just couldn't composite it properly
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.560]   It was it was too much for the phone and the processors back then and when they could properly composite the layers
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.240]   They let you do it and I think you know
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:45.160]   There's a lot of arguments about the watch faces right now, but there's a couple things to remember one
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.360]   There's no native apps yet and developers can't make watch faces out native apps trying to shoot a watch face
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.440]   It's a series of PNG images over Bluetooth is not gonna be successful for anyone
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.880]   So it's until there's native code running on the phone having a discussion about
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:05.440]   Watch faces is just incredibly premature rather than that they've already ditched the photos and the time-lapse watch face because of power
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.040]   Reasons because anytime you have a pixel lit up on OLED it uses power and a photo watch face lights up every pixel
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.960]   Unlike the very linear line art style watch faces. They're doing there
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.920]   The the culture thing is harder though because you know Apple does allow custom keyboards now
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   Which a lot of us thought they might never do and there's a custom keyboard extension
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.720]   So maybe one day there'll be a custom watch face extension
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.600]   I don't I don't know I don't think there will be but it's always possible and it's hard to speak in absolute
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.320]   But going back to just the watch face things not having it on the first
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.720]   Version of the shipping product. I think that's a given. It's just absolutely a given at this point
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:43.800]   You know who will get a watch sooner than later developers Apple according to Mac rumors Apple has
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:50.880]   Started sending out emails to iOS developers offering them a chance to purchase a 42 millimeter sport
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.720]   With a blue band with a guaranteed shipment of April 28th
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.960]   in order for them to start developing so
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:04.280]   It's not guaranteed the they say random selection quantities are limited
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:11.960]   But if you're a developer look for that email you have till to a Thursday to let them know that you want it
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.040]   Well, that must be us only because I don't think I received that email. Yeah, this are you a developer?
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.440]   I'm registered as a developer. Yeah, well, yes. I am - or not. Yeah, I didn't get it either. Yeah
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.400]   Maybe you have to actually really be a
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:30.340]   You have to have at least two apps in the app store to get this email
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:35.600]   We have six I think we didn't get one. Oh, well, that sucks
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.600]   Check your spam folder. We're nice. You know you get it's name. So you should be okay
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:48.560]   Groobers laughing at the heavily skewomorphic watch faces on face or face repo including this
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.040]   this one of the
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.560]   Android
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:58.240]   You could have this on your Android where Android robot urinating on a gold apple
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:04.280]   I might download that right now just just to make people angry
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.840]   One of the things also is polite because Apple Apple takes editorial responsibility for their content
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.680]   Policing IP on this stuff is especially when you're cool. It gets as much scrutiny as Apple is an on trivial
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.320]   Yeah, and this is actually a big issue for Google because a lot of the watches are
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:23.040]   Copyrighted trademark violations. There's talk your watches watch faces. There's protect Philippe
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.800]   There's a lot of brand names in face repo and things are often more nuanced and Internet anger allows for yes
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.120]   Gosh darn new Internet anger
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.520]   Didn't Apple have to settle with the the switch clock people
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:40.880]   But they but they out read they out right stole that watch face from the switch the Swiss rail ray folks
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:46.560]   That was just a pay for it. Then he stopped using it immediately. Yeah, that was absolute just outright thievery
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:55.840]   Let's see a few people in the chair, I'm noticing are saying they have received notifications
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.280]   In fact some have gone in and checked just because we've been talking about it
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.200]   Webmaster 305 says yes, my Apple watch order was updated preparing for shipment
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.280]   so
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.280]   check check your
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.440]   Check your your Apple store page and see what's what's going on
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:26.240]   About nine to five Mac good news Alex says keynote has been updated for a watch based remote
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.520]   So it's not just power point
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.680]   Good news actually well, yeah, you use as soon as it as soon as you set it
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.200]   I was just thinking all the things that you do when you're presenting or doing a class or whatever
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.440]   It would be great. You're watching. It's gonna be it's gonna be excited. Just it stays with you
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.000]   You know nice new mute and unmute so the PowerPoint for iPhone is now Apple watch
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.480]   There are a number of updated apps coming all the time
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.720]   What else have you guys seen updated to support?
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.500]   Terrific. I think yesterday nice so tweets go to the watch. Yeah, and the Twitter app the new will
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.180]   I did yeah, the Apple remote as well for your Apple TV. That's awesome. I
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.980]   You know I lose my oh the time and it's such a pain to take your phone out and get the application
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.920]   Although the actors work fine, but to have it just on you missed all the time we grow
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:18.100]   Let's build in and so if if you have an Apple watch and you have these apps on your iPhone
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:23.420]   That's all you need to worry about once you pair the watch it a lot of matically updated to the Apple watch companion app
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.500]   The one that runs on your iPhone has a second tab that says store on it and come Friday
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.460]   That'll be lit up and you'll see a bunch of apps in there
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:35.220]   And then that you'll be able to take the the apps that are listed there and transfer their watch kit extension to your phone
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.100]   I don't open this app anymore because it's just taunting me good morning
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.460]   If you have an Apple watch with your iPhone here
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:48.460]   Yeah, don't don't taunt me like that did I read there was a limit to the number of third party apps?
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.740]   You could actually have on the watch maybe I
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.180]   Mean there's limited memory, right?
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:33:00.700]   I mean it's got eight gigabytes and I think two gigabytes is reserved for music a half a gigabyte for images and the rest for the system
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:07.340]   And for apps by the way if you want to watch the videos looks like they're all done now the how-to videos have been updated and
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:13.860]   Are available not only of course at Apple.com, but on the watch app itself on your iPhone
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:20.300]   So you can watch all the videos they've made now. Let's see health and fitness digital touch
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.360]   Faces message all they're not they're not done. There's still some unfinished aren't there?
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.980]   Where they come on Apple what's holding up it's holding you up
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:36.380]   Johnny has to approve each one Leo it's my guess that there are people we know
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.060]   Who are working on these videos right now?
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.300]   In fact, I more than a guess and I'm not talking about you Alex Lindsey
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:50.940]   So yeah, they've been they've been shooting these I've been told they've been shooting these in a warehouse in the Bay Area
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.220]   for some time now and
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:59.420]   Can you imagine it must be that white room warehouse where they light everything up and and the amount of
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.860]   Trouble doing something like that
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:10.900]   Must be I see the heat pattern from orbit. Yeah, so still to come Apple pay activity and workout, but they have added
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:17.660]   phone calls Siri maps and music and I think as we sit here waiting for our text message
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:25.320]   You you got something to do you can watch these videos. It's been I found it very helpful to actually kind of look at the videos
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:32.500]   So that I understand how it's gonna work. I think the goal is that you're an expert in the watch by the time the watch arrives, right?
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.500]   You know, that's that's the key to the operation
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.340]   All right
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.460]   Have we exhausted the topic today because you know next week all we're gonna be doing is going
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.460]   I'm hoping all we're gonna be doing is
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.180]   So you won't have one Renee
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.180]   Yeah, so you won't be going
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.300]   Alex you won't have one
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.220]   July
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.900]   Maybe you and I will have one done. We just don't know yet. Yeah, yeah
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:06.220]   Hopefully by this time next week even if it doesn't arrive on the 24th that still you know a couple of days after possibly but fingers crossed
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:12.140]   We'll do a unboxing the minute mind gets here. It's shipping to the studio and
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:17.900]   My hope was to be able to do that live on before you buy this Friday at 2 p.m. Civic 5 p.m. Eastern
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.540]   2100 UTC, so watch BYB if I get it. We'll unbox it
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:29.700]   He's stainless steel just like you the stainless steel with a Milanese loop. We have good taste good taste
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.620]   That's right. That's right. I was to be honest
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:37.140]   It was one of those last minute things though because I was gonna go with the the the black sports
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.580]   And then like literally the day before cuz I was so
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.980]   I was sort of you know undecided right the way through and then
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.620]   It's like 12 hours before order. He said no, I'll go with the stainless steel and middle and easily
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.980]   site unseen speaking of Milanese Milan design week Milano
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:59.740]   Italia design week is going on and Johnny I was there
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.260]   Hang in with Carl in the gang
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.540]   Gianni Gianni Johnny
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:13.900]   Hey, what are you got for us some beautiful sport to band the colors
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.420]   really simo
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.860]   really simo a
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:24.660]   Showcase at the Milan salone del mobile a design fair in italia, which by the way nine to five Mac typos to it late
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:30.420]   Attended by Apple executives including Phil Schiller mark Newsome and of course
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.060]   sir
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.060]   Johnny I've and
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:42.140]   They showed off there are these new these bands or is it just there there and not publicly available or previously unannounced
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.220]   I don't know the right term is but yeah, there's yellow and red and midnight blue
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:51.420]   And he is a mark a noosome. He's a wedding a black a sport to band
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:57.740]   We don't have a black a sport, but Newsome is of course a very famous designer friend of Johnny Ives
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.460]   Who is joined Apple last year?
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:06.460]   Cilan and then watches that he designed are very similar in the many ways to what the Apple watch turned out to be yeah
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:13.180]   Isn't that interesting yeah, so he should get the straps. He should get some credit. He's strapping. They call him the strap man
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.540]   Cupertino
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.500]   This is I guess is the best picture we have here of a of a rack of straps looks like purple
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:28.580]   Bright red a nice bright red. I like that and waiting for the Samuel Jackson Instagram with his purple apple
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.580]   Yeah, he should have a purple one
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.100]   You could take the red watch of the blue watch
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:40.300]   The red strap mustn't be too far away because it'll be a product red strap only all product red strap
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.740]   I like it. Yeah, so I would imagine we'll see that
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.460]   They're not too distant future and apparently
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:52.260]   People were squeying over this Apple's innovative new UK plug design
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:38:00.420]   Nice actually that's pretty cool. So it's flat in your pocket because the UK plugs a big heavy prongs
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.700]   They're quite bulky, but they're extremely well designed for safety
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.900]   You know if you notice on the the prongs sticking out
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:12.940]   You've got installation and the the metal tips and then the earth is actually longer and that in a UK plug that actually
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.180]   Opens a gate so that the the live then you should can actually go in so it's extremely well designed
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:23.980]   But it is very bulky and I've seen another one. There's another travel plug which is similar to this but like a fold
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.460]   Sort of twist and fold one which has been out like a USB adapter with the the UK prongs
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:34.940]   I'm that's the first charger from you know a big presumably if it is the Apple charger
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.140]   That's the first time I've seen that sort of design from a major money file like it
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.300]   It's good. I think I should change all plug receptacles to duplicate the UK plug
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:49.580]   You know as a as a consumer they drive me crazy because it's always like this huge thing that you have to carry around
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:56.020]   the only one worse than than the UK is South Africa because I was like giant giant circular and
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:01.580]   The but as a production person. I love you K-plugs. I wish everything was okay
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:06.460]   Because when you're putting together all your gear and you're putting it's like chum chum chum chum chum chum
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.940]   And you just know that there's no way that's coming out. Well, there's a
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.660]   Right
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:15.940]   Yeah, when I come over to the States, I always find that those little American flimsy to prong things
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.260]   They just fall out the wall it plugged them in and then they if some if you put some
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.100]   So wait on it just sort of drips down or it drops out and
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.100]   Not
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:35.100]   If you took a UK plug and stuck it in you could repel off of that
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:44.540]   Yeah, exactly what in Canada, you're just the same as us right down. Yeah, we have to be the other ways
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:49.980]   We couldn't use anything all right. So at least the at least the Europeans have the round pins and then a little bit more
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.580]   You know stable, but those five. Yeah, I don't like those either
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.620]   I like the UK plug ours are meant to support a cable industry folks. What are your priorities?
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.180]   By the way, this picture comes from
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:07.380]   famed apparently famed rugby player and captain turned cyclist will Carling and
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.020]   I guess he's received his watch and he
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:17.660]   Unlike others this guy. He knows his stuff. He took a picture of the plug. I think he was answering some questions on Twitter -
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.960]   He was neat clue it in that's really that's pretty cool. Isn't it? I like this red
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.100]   Yeah, although
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:35.140]   According to those folks those snarky folks at nine to five mr. Carling is wearing his bottom band upside down
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:42.500]   Mr. Carling your word I can clearly see the medium-large sizing mark
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.000]   This is a
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.040]   So red navy light pink
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.400]   New bands and purples new - isn't it? I haven't seen the purple before
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:59.040]   All right, I don't know what else is there to say about the watch Renee you got any other
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:04.600]   Juicy tidbits before we move on. Hey, it just feels like we were talking about it foreverly
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.160]   I just wanted to arrive now. I know I know I'm done I
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:14.280]   Have actually some more we have a talk about the estimates on sales because they're very quite wildly and I'm
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:19.000]   I'm curious what you guys think of those before we do that though. Let's talk about my clothes cuz you know what?
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.280]   It's not just Carl Lagerfeld and will Carlin and
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:29.040]   Bayon say that her snazzy thanks to trunk club. I'm getting more snazzy look guys
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:34.520]   I know we all hate to shop except for gadgets and tools when it comes to clothes shopping. It's the worst
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:40.000]   That's why I was so happy about trunk club gals have had solutions like this for years, but now
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.560]   trunk club guys you can talk to your
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:49.200]   Personal stylist - Robin you can't have her I talked to Robin
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:54.440]   For about I think about half an hour. She was very it was fun. I was talking about my you know
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.920]   And I was I was it's like talking to a doctor. You could say yeah kind of fat and she she doesn't mock me
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.840]   Yeah, little chunky thick around the middle and we talked about sizes
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.400]   Styles said well, you know I come from a preppy background
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.680]   She said we'll fix that and
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:17.520]   And so forth and then she goes online and posts a page just for you with some suggestions and it's like hot or not
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.160]   You go through them and you say I'll never wear that. Oh, yeah, I'll wear that I like that
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:28.200]   No, no, then this is the best part and by the way at this point you have paid zero zip-zilch nothing
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.600]   My box comes a trunk. My first trunk was actually a even bigger trunk
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.360]   this
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:43.080]   This is a medium-sized trunk and in it are beautiful clothes now you still have paid nothing for shipping
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:46.560]   Nothing for the clothes you have 10 days to go through the trunk
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.080]   Look at all the things Robin picked out some oh, I love the cable knit sweaters. You picked out
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.200]   This is something I probably would have never bought for myself, but it's so beautiful
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.480]   It's kind of a pea coat
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:02.920]   Updated pea coat style and I just I'm really excited about this unstructured. It's soft. I'm learning all these words like that
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.600]   shirts pants
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.000]   Neckties pocket squares even shoes you turn all in your size
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:17.320]   Actually, she said two of these pea coats because she wasn't sure about the sizing exactly you keep what you want
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:24.520]   And you send the rest back 10 days to decide and then and only then you get charged and only for the stuff you kept
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:30.560]   Ship it all back. You still paying nothing and another thing. There's no monthly subscription no monthly fees
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:38.640]   It you just whenever you know you want more clothes you call Robin or whoever your stylist is and say it's time for another trunk
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   And she'll set it up for you. I
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.440]   Love this trunk club is a revelation
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:50.320]   I've already had three trunks because I kind of fell in love with it. It's so much fun
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:57.800]   Your own personal stylist a real person who will pick based on your lifestyle your preferences whether it's bold casual business formal
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:04.680]   She'll get you something you like shirt shoes slacks jeans belts jackets really great brands

[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:04.320]   I feel like I'm just a new me
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.160]   Thank you trunk club
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:16.440]   KGI so I've seen estimates ranging from a million watches in the first weekend to a high which comes from KGI of
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.960]   2.3 million Apple watch pre-orders
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.440]   KGI and I don't know I want to vet this with you guys
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.520]   It says 85 percent sport
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.560]   Less than 1 percent addition
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:38.360]   The run rate 2 to 3 million per month. This is Ming chi quo
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.520]   Who is I think has a pretty is he's yeah?
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:46.200]   Yeah, I think he's the most reliable of the financial analyst
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.000]   But I think also the million number was just us and I think I was doing international
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.480]   I'm not well this this is I mean good lord
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.840]   It's a lot of watch and the addition is really low because I guess Apple keeps giving them away
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:04.840]   Look at that price ten thousand dollars and up no, you know 1% that I think if you got 1%
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:09.080]   You'd be happy of a 3 million breakdown of how much money based on these estimates
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:16.200]   How much money Apple would make per collection and the addition I think was still second only to the sport just because it's such it's so
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.800]   Much money for sold so much markup. Yeah
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:25.320]   I thought that stainless steel the middle one would sell better
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.280]   I mean at this it looks like it's around 14 or 15% of the total
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:34.940]   But it's a it's a it's a really expensive when you think about it. I mean it's around six 700 bucks buying a computer
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:41.320]   I mean, you know, you know at that point. Yeah, 600 to 1500 the one that I got and Don got was 650
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.200]   I don't know what was it in the UK 650 US dollars?
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:49.020]   Can't remember now. Look at it. Is there a big markup because they often do that they do that to
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.360]   Indians and
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:55.960]   You're the ad that in the that is included in the price in the yeah, we have we act in the US and the VAT steep
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.240]   20% yeah
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:05.520]   15.5% he's a mini Christmas, but you guys get health care
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.440]   yeah
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:14.880]   The run rate of two or three now see this is a really an interesting question because I do think that it you could make the case that
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.300]   Yeah, sure it's gonna sell really well at first huge pent-up demand the most
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:24.040]   Avid Apple aficionados and there's certainly millions of those will buy right away
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:32.080]   But I think it's also conceivable that the sales could drop maybe even precipitously in the subsequent months as
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:37.520]   People get get it and say well, it's cool, but not great or maybe not great at all or I
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:42.840]   Think it's insulated a little bit because Apple only counts the sale when it ships
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.480]   I believe and they won't be shipping until May June July
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:51.280]   Several months to include good sales good point. So maybe yeah, no, that's an excellent point
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.160]   With the problem is that we're not gonna find out what so yeah
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.920]   I think the proof is obviously gonna be in the actual quality of the product
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   So that is gonna be the thing that you know the you can sell I think Apple can sell
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:10.120]   Five million six million of these just from people who are excited about the the possibility
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:17.600]   Yeah, and then after that it really depends on you know whether it's actually a utility to people's lives
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.080]   So this quarter will be great the summer it'll be the next quarter that'll be the test
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.080]   Right and the good
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.080]   And the good
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.080]   I think
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   Right
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.080]   The
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.640]   Jim Dallerlitt a good he had a good metric he did a post on loop where he said that he doesn't really care about sales
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.700]   Numbers about customers that numbers he just wants to know how many people are still wearing them a week later
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:40.320]   I'm right later three months later six months later, right and that you can verify just by looking
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:50.560]   Will I be wearing mine in September? Will you be wearing yours in September the you know, I far prefer Android as I've made very clear
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.560]   I'm sorry to
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:57.200]   As from a phone point of view, but will the watch be enough to keep me on iOS?
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:01.400]   You know, I like iOS perfectly well. It's not like I loathe iOS
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:07.720]   But I will miss some features of Android I admit and it's not interesting thing and I didn't know this
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:17.520]   Maybe Alex you knew it the way Android's designed there is a roughly guaranteed 10 millisecond audio latency
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.080]   and
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.360]   Maybe much more in Android and that's one of the reasons you see so few
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.600]   Music performance apps on Android tablets
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:33.920]   You wouldn't they this is from super powered calm. They call it androids 10 millisecond problem and
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.960]   And I had not heard of this before but it does explain something I mean you
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:44.680]   They say it's like dragging the beat like a whiplash not not my tempo
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.920]   And so if you were trying to perform at a band with iOS devices and you're using Android you'd be off about half a beat
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   Does that make sense? I haven't heard that but I can definitely see that that would be that would definitely be an issue
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:02.040]   But you know 10 milliseconds is very very small amount of time
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.920]   So I mean a frame of video is is 30 milliseconds, right?
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:09.960]   This is a third of a frame, but but music it would definitely if you were trying to use it in performance
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.440]   Use it in life and be a huge issue and the latency might even be greater
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.880]   That's you know, that's kind of your base to be honest with you. I'd be surprised
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:21.000]   I I would think that even the iPhone would have 10 milliseconds of delay
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.560]   So I'm kind of surprised that it is truly zero latency
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.320]   Most Android apps have more than a hundred milliseconds of audio output
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.200]   Latency and the round trip is 200 milliseconds or a fifth of a second
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:40.560]   That that would be a fifth of a second that is significant in terms of musician and ship and playing
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:46.440]   And that's and that's really like what you would expect from a telephone telephone call or a go-to meeting or anything like that
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.320]   Those are about 200 a 200 milliseconds
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.600]   If you're in the same room as someone you're talking to on the phone
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:55.800]   You get kind of a sense of how long that round trip is and that that stays pretty constant across most devices
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.720]   It's one of the reasons why it's difficult to do these duets over the internet, you know when you have
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:08.600]   You know Tony Bennett in one studio and and Lady Gaga across the country in another they'd it's hard to do that
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.120]   But they have solved that. I mean they've got I think I SDN and other techniques have gotten latency down to
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.960]   10 to 5
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:20.080]   Optical fibers is really the way to do it and even then you're still losing
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.920]   I think it's typically that well what they'll tell you is about
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.240]   You know five milliseconds per hundred miles
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.520]   I think there's ways to get it down to about 200 two milliseconds per hundred miles
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.400]   But it's still you know
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:37.960]   It's that's about the kind of latency you're gonna see so it is still challenging that we've done some stuff even over hangouts
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.960]   That have been across
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.560]   Actually Canada and not the United States, but
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:49.380]   But a lot more across in Canada than there is in the US right but but you're what we didn't do
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:52.480]   We kind of talked the folks we were working with out of was
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.040]   Trying to actually harmonize that's really where things become like if you're doing
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.800]   Yeah, so what you can do is send and receive so have someone do something and have them
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:06.000]   You know give a hand off and the other people pick it up that you can do with you know a lot of latency
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.400]   But the actual keeping things in harmony or keeping things to the beat is almost impossible virtually right
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.100]   The one thing that I heard
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:18.480]   Consistently from developers was that a lot of people underestimate the cocoa touch frameworks
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.200]   For example, Apple has core audio and they have accelerate
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.240]   Which is a lot of the math that a lot of music apps use and they get all of that for free
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.840]   So it really cuts down the amount of development work
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:27.800]   And I don't want to name any names
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:34.080]   But there are some apps that just don't exist on Android because they just can't put in the effort to rebuild all that stuff from scratch
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.000]   And the ones that do it took them literally a year a year and a half two years
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   To rebuild that to a level that it matched what they got in iOS basically for free
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.240]   I've heard that many times from developers. They're also animation much easier on iOS the bait the
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:54.720]   Tools and libraries you're provided with are much easier to use on the material design iOS developers. Is that why you're nodding? Yeah
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.560]   Okay a couple of people in studio going
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.360]   so
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.160]   You see we're objective here we cover it all there's something good something bad
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:14.720]   We'll talk about it and my my issue is much is just much more at a higher level of UI and
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:20.880]   And I think if I don't take my iPhone out of the pocket if I like the UI on the watch that may solve it all right
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:27.920]   It's interesting that a couple of people who aren't sort of Apple aficionados that I've spoken to who are interested in the watch
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:33.880]   Are are interested for that very reason that they want to they have jobs where they can't easily take the phone out
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.940]   right and they would like access to the phone's features from the watch so they can just
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:45.360]   Staglance at it and check things and I was quite surprised really because there were two people that I thought probably you know
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.360]   It wasn't even on their radar, but they were
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:54.000]   And they're well up for it. Yeah, you know what? I'm really interested in I just they sent me a few so I just kind of out of the blue a
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.440]   thing called skybell
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:03.120]   Which is a doorbell and actually installed at home that has it has a camera on it and it's Wi-Fi enabled
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:08.960]   So one of the problems we had is we our doorbell is so funky people bring the bell and I don't hear it
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:15.760]   We're busy. We're in the other room. So this will ring that when you ring the doorbell rings all my devices Android and iOS are all going off and
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:21.960]   Then you can press a button and talk back to the person at the door and see a picture even if you're here if I'm at work
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:26.440]   But they apparently they're gonna have an Apple watch interface for the iOS version
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.120]   Which means I'll be finally be able to answer the door for my watch
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.800]   Won't that be interesting every kid's dream
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:42.480]   Cool idea nice if you know there is a camera they can't see me, but I can see them. Yeah
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:46.000]   It's pretty amazing
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.160]   Not it's 200 bucks and it's a little wonky, but it but because somebody called the radio show and said I can't get it working
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:56.680]   So I guess they heard that and they sent me some and I installed it and it works great I
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:04.000]   Can turn on the camera right now actually and see you know what's going on at my front angry mailman. Yeah, hey
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.200]   Well, that's the funny thing cuz FedEx and the mailman do ring the front door
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.560]   Bell and so I do get no legal ding dong
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:16.680]   I know you're in there La Porte. I know you're in there. Let's see if I can see what's going on
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:21.680]   Out front of my house nothing nothing right now
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:26.400]   But there it is and I can say hey, what you doing? Hey get away from there
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:30.760]   Or cat or cat is that funny?
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.480]   That's the that's the actual live picture from my front door
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:42.140]   So that's kind of cool and I love the idea that I could do that on my watch would I the watch can't do like a live
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:47.480]   Video feed the blue show. Yeah, they showed it at the event using I forget the name of the garage door. Yeah the garage door
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:53.800]   Isn't that neat it's not live video only as far as I know the native apps like if you use the phone
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:59.760]   There's a remote shutter for the phone where you can see through the viewfinder of your iPhone and then take pictures remotely with the watch
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:06.560]   That's real-time video what I think the third-party watch kit extensions are doing is throwing again throwing PNG files at a as high a
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:12.120]   Frame rate is they can't oh that's interesting so low frame rate, but you see something yeah
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.120]   I don't know what the frame rate is nobody's moving
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.640]   Which could be scary if it looks like a zombie coming at well, I could take a picture of it if there's a zombie
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:25.160]   I think we're really entering an interesting era of connectivity with this Internet of Things stuff
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:31.160]   Anyway, this is called Skybell. It's a couple hundred bucks. I'll do a full review at some point on before you buy
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:38.600]   We did you talk last week about the memo the errands memo saying we're not gonna put watches in the store
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   So forget about it. Yeah
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:45.360]   That seems sensible because there's so many skews on this is kind of an unusual product for Apple
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:51.280]   Well, I think if they had just an enormous supply and a really good idea of what the demand curve would be for each
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:53.760]   Separate model it would be easier for them to stock it
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:57:00.880]   But this this seems like the best of a of a strained supply constrained situation and then at some point she says until June or at some point
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:05.080]   You're exactly right. They'll have enough supply and they'll have data points to know
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:10.480]   You know, it's like McDonald's how many big Macs you gonna make how many how many regulars you gonna make you just
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.560]   You know after a while
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:17.520]   Apparently there was some concern that people would line up and they'd be spending like six eight hours in line and they'd get there
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.520]   And they'd say I want to stay in a store in Milanese
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.560]   Sorry, all we have is the pink sport left and then
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:27.880]   They weren't happy with and that happened to me when they said with the iPhone 6 I got the equivalent of the pink sport iPhones
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:32.640]   The other problem as well is if people turn up at the store to buy these things is that you know
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:36.200]   Because it is a very personal thing and you if people have it in their mind, right?
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.640]   I'm gonna buy the 42 milli knees and they go in they try it on
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.240]   So actually know can I try another one because I don't like this
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:46.720]   So, you know, you end up with people going through the entire range of straps and watches to actually buy it there
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:49.920]   So I think that they've tackled it probably as best they could to you know
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.720]   Do the pre-orders online and and go in for an appointment
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:57.420]   So people I know people have actually gone in tried it on and actually changed the mind and reordered it at that point
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:01.400]   So it's a long did easy to do that bigger one. Did she yeah, I'm afraid
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.960]   I've I've afraid of the little ones could be too little for me
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:09.000]   So how many skews are there there's in aluminum. There's just one right
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.920]   Not bad each straight each strap is considered a separate skew because you buy them as a paired unit
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.800]   Okay, but let's let's not okay. That's bad
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.520]   So let's take the straps off in the aluminum
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:25.440]   There's 38 and 42 in the stainless there's four because there's 38 and 42 for silver and black right?
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:28.840]   Yes, they've an aluminum because there's silver and there's also space gray. Oh, there's space gray
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:38.120]   So there's 12 skews then because there's four in each so there's 12 different kinds of watches and then a lot of different kinds of bands
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:43.640]   So I could see how keeping that all stocked up would be difficult
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:49.560]   One thing my mom did her try on last week and she was really impressed with the accessibility of the straps because she's older now
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.440]   And she says she has a lot of trouble with some jewelry putting the straps on off
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:56.960]   And she found a lot of the Apple bands really as soon as they told her how to use it really easy and really accessible
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.960]   Which one did she like for accessibility?
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:04.480]   She liked especially like the loops and I think I made a joke that the loops are essentially the Lulu lemon pants of
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:12.360]   But even though even the bracelets you had an easy time because the modern buckle it looks like a buckle
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:17.880]   But it's actually magnetic parts that magnetically adhere together and that makes it really easy to put it together. Okay
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:23.940]   Apple has talked about the deep the technology and functionality behind Apple's heart rate
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.860]   Monitor this is in a new support page
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:32.000]   At support.apple.com it's h t 204
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.760]   666
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:43.380]   The mark of the watch your heart rate what it means and where on Apple watch you'll find it it describes how it measures it
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.380]   those are four little
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:49.040]   Sensors on the back you've seen we've probably all seen those
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.200]   So it uses infrared light
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:56.160]   To measure your heart rate every 10 minutes, so it's not continuous
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:02.800]   If the infrared system isn't providing an adequate reading it switches to green LEDs
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:10.000]   In addition the heart rate sensors designed to compensate for low signal levels by increasing both brightness and sampling rate
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.240]   So you can see how it's gonna be hard to say what your battery life is if you have, you know thick skin
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.040]   It might be worse battery life. I think also when you're doing the workout app
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:23.720]   It takes much more frequent read out or so it can give you more accurate the technique is something called
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.640]   photoplethysmography
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.360]   Photo plethysmography blood is red
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.520]   It reflects red light and absorbs green light
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:40.880]   So the green LEDs paired with light sensitive photo diodes. That's the the other two dots
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.200]   Will detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment?
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.920]   So as your heart beats blood flows the green light absorption goes up and
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:56.680]   Then it goes down up down right so by measuring the difference it can actually count
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:04.760]   Your heart beats by flashing the LED lights hundreds of times per second it calculates the number of time the heart beats each minute your heart
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:13.000]   Rate the fit is important of course if your Apple watch doesn't stay in place or sensors aren't reading your heart rate tighten the band a bit
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.400]   It should be snug but comfortable in other words it needs to make contact with your skin
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.600]   I think there a lot of people wear wrist watches a little loose so they kind of wobble
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.400]   You may not like that but for sport activity you're gonna want to tighten it anyway
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:33.880]   I like the idea that measuring it throughout the day not just when I'm working out, but throughout the day. I love that idea
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.920]   Wish you could do blood pressure throughout the day
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:44.100]   Many factors can affect the performance of the heart rate sensor skin perfusion is one a
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:50.440]   Fancy way of describing how much blood flows through your skin apparently skin perfusion varies
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.840]   considerably from person to person and
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:59.120]   Environment if you're in the cold the perfusion may be too low for the heart rate sensor to get a reading
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:03.360]   So it's only gonna work for you Renee in the summer like a vampire the blood retreats
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:10.600]   Motion is another factor rhythmic movements like running or cycling give better results
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:18.120]   Compared to irregular movements like tennis or boxing. Okay, so when I box I won't wear my Apple watch that seems like a good plan
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.640]   It's got a box regularly
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.760]   Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:29.640]   I'm a bit worried with them with the fitness tracking for me because
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.840]   During the working day I actually use my treadmill so I have a treadmill desk and I've always found with the up
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.480]   Band with all the other fitness band I've tried because if I were on my wrist
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.320]   It doesn't actually reflect the number of steps because I'm actually typing at the same time
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:49.320]   So I'm hoping it's gonna work slightly better, but I'm not I'm not 100% sure it's gonna be completely accurate
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:55.760]   Apparently it is better at Renee you were saying this better at you know a lot of the
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.080]   Pidometers out there really are walking and running and that's yes
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.920]   Yeah, and they if you watch that video again from ABC where they took him into the lab
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.440]   You see that they did extensive modeling on a fitness equipment
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:12.160]   There's rowing machines and stationary bikes and treadmills and all of those things and they're using every sensor
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:18.200]   They have not just not just the the stair climber or the step counter to try and model what you're actually doing
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.200]   That's what it says here
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:25.360]   It says heart rate is just one of the many factors the Apple watch uses to measure your activity and exercise depending on your workout
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.520]   It selects let me make it a little bit bigger so you can see this on the screen
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.440]   It selects the most appropriate inputs for that activity when you're running indoors
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:39.520]   It also uses the accelerometer when you're cycling outdoors. It uses the GPS on your iPhone of course the watch doesn't have GPS
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:44.680]   So you'd have to have your iPhone for it to measure that and even when you're not in a dedicated work out
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.200]   It tracks how much you move each day. That's that neat little thing
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:54.800]   The half moon thing so Apple watch can give you information and motivation improve your fitness health action for that reason alone
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:00.320]   I'm very interested and I love the idea that I could see oh you spent a lot of time sitting get up. I like that
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.800]   And it'll also measure and it's trying to encourage you so doesn't want you to fail
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.800]   So it'll adjust downwards if you're having a bad week and adjust upwards again
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.280]   We're having a good week and it looks motivationally very sound
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:15.440]   It also and I didn't know this I hadn't seen this before it will work with Bluetooth chest straps
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:21.220]   So many of us use like the polar watch or the polar chest straps. It will support that as well
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.160]   So that's I think that I do think that at some point
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.560]   I mean this is really the beginning of this
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.400]   But I think we're gonna see a much more tight integration between exercise equipment and a variety of other things with things like the watch
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.680]   I think yeah, I'm surprised we didn't see it as much with the phones
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.280]   But I think that you know I think the watch is just perfect to be able to I mean
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.880]   I think eventually you're gonna walk up to your to your you know lat pull down
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.640]   And it's gonna know what you did last time how many reps and it's gonna tell you how many you know
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.160]   What weight to put it on and what you know and all of that's gonna be going back and forth between the machine and the watch
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.360]   I
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:59.120]   Think the opportunities here are great, but we've seen that before with Apple and critical mass is is
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.320]   critical getting enough people using it so that
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:05.720]   Makers of equipment will say oh we should support the watch
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:11.120]   I don't know if this for sure, but there was a rumor that there was only gonna be like maybe a hundred or two hundred apps
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:17.680]   Available at launch the ones at Apple had you know spent a lot of time with the developers on but given how they've been doing everything and all the stuff
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.840]   That we've been saying looks like there's gonna be thousands of apps available
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.720]   Not everyone is gonna want all those apps of course
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.320]   But there's a higher likelihood that you'll find those one or two or three apps that really make a huge deal to you
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:27.680]   Yeah
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.200]   I think that sort of critical mass is part of this because we saw with the app store and iPhone 3g when that happened all of a sudden
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.920]   It was super monkey ball for one person
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.760]   It was a Facebook phone for somebody else Twitter phone for somebody else and it really did change
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.080]   How have you wanted to you how sticky that phone became?
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.600]   Apple's learned a little bit from jawbone which had to recall some of its bands because of nickel
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:55.880]   Nickel sensitivity I didn't I was not sensitized to this issue, but it's a significant issue and that means a lot of people cannot wear
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:03.800]   Anything on their skin that has a significant nickel Apple has very been very careful about that
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:08.880]   They they have a whole page dedicated to that as well on the support page
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:17.000]   Thousands of material composition tests more than a thousand prototypes worn for trial studies hundreds of toxicological assessments
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.640]   consultations with board certified
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.680]   dermatologists
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.840]   So if you have allergies or sensitivities
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:33.840]   It does say the Apple Watch space gray Apple Watch sports stainless steel portions of some watch bands and the magnets in the watch and bands do contain nickel
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.760]   But they all fall below the strict nickel restrictions set by the European reach regulation
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.880]   so you will have some nickel exposure but the
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:51.880]   Possibility of nickel related related relations is very low and then methacrylates methacrylates
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:57.480]   The Apple Watch case the millenies loop the modern buckle and the leather loop contain trace amounts of
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.000]   Methacrylates from adhesives
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.840]   Band-aids have them some people have sensitivities
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.600]   They do warn people
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:13.640]   These parts are not in direct contact with your skin, but it is a potential cause of discomfort
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.080]   They also say don't wear your watch too tight
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:24.280]   Also care and cleaning do not put your wash watch in the wash
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:31.280]   But you could clean it with a cloth that comes with it a lint free cloth comes with it
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.480]   Just as it does with the laptops just not an orange one
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:43.200]   Apple Watch is water resistant you may dampen the cloth with clean water
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.160]   They're they're not saying Windex so don't maybe
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:50.800]   Apple Watch is splash and water resistant not waterproof
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.800]   You can wear and use it during exercise in the rain while washing your hands do not submerge it the rating for those who are curious
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.480]   IPX
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.000]   7 and
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.440]   If you're wearing a leather band, that's probably not actually to get that wet
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:09.720]   I can't I love leather bands, but you know just from my own sweat they get kind of funky pretty quick
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.080]   So that's why I got the millenies loop
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:19.600]   And the magnet that means it fits out, you know exactly right no matter what it's the stretch pants of watch bands
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:26.480]   It is your it's the Lulu lemon, baby. I got I got yoga pants on my wrist. Yes. Oh, they should use that slogan
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.120]   It's yoga pets for your wrist
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:39.400]   All right, I have now I believe depleted all possible Apple Watch stories you agree guys
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:50.040]   There's one I saw another story today about returns for the edition that they're gonna really strict yeah
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.480]   They're gonna have a really strict policy and they're going to
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.760]   If you take an addition back to the Apple store to return it they're going to
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:03.160]   Examine it with microscopes. They're going to weigh it so to make sure none of the gold has been extracted from inside the case so that you know
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:09.360]   So that that was the only other thing that's because there are bad people out there who will take the one shave some gold off of it
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.160]   Do that 10 times you know for that 100 times stop
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:21.040]   More likely I think much more likely you the people who would borrow it basically so they could wear it at a
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.560]   Vessuari
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:28.520]   And I think that's what Beyonce did and then bring it back pretty sure Beyonce did that no
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:32.160]   All right
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:39.760]   We haven't see our ones as wait a minute guys you can't stop we haven't talked about the box it comes in yet
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:49.160]   So I again, I'm hoping that we'll have something to unbox on Friday. I hope Apple I
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.080]   Mean I can't say that that lives up to its promise because they said all they promised was April 24th through May 8th
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:04.320]   Fingers crossed Leo. I have really got my fingers and toes crossed. I will you know, I mean course this is it's so sad
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.160]   It's a pathetic statement about me and our society
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:12.160]   Three days after it comes I'll be saying what's next. Yeah, no what true
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.480]   What else am I waiting for
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.280]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at SmartThings you don't have to wait to smarten your home
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.080]   SmartThings makes it easy
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:31.080]   And this is actually I feel like this was you know, sometimes I think about I don't know flying cars or smartwatches
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:38.400]   But really to me the future began when you could actually make your home a smart home without becoming you know being an ultra geek
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.920]   And I've tried for years to do this smart thing solved it
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:49.920]   This was a Kickstarter project that was very exciting the idea was instead of having a different app for your lights your music your locks
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:56.200]   For everything that you've got in your house one app on your iPhone or Android device
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.880]   talks to the smart things hub and
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.560]   Then the smart things hub talks to everything else
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.160]   And they've really done a marvelous job not only of supporting most of the other products in the market
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:12.720]   But making their own devices like the smart power outlet the smart sense motion
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.520]   So this could turn on your lights when you arrive home
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:24.840]   Or if you're not home and there's motion you could say what's going on in there smart things also has security kits including cameras
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.840]   So you can look inside the smart sense
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:35.840]   What else do we have here there's moisture sensors? This is kind of cool. This is the traditional open and closed windows sensor the two-piece sensor
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.200]   But it also while it's doing that measures the temperature
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:46.080]   So you can know when windows or doors or cabinets are open, but it also can tell you what temperature it is
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:51.200]   This the present sensor. This is a little dongle. You can put in their keys or better yet putting your kids backpack
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.080]   So you know where you when your kids get home or when they leave home
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.240]   Just some really cool stuff. So these are the smart things
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:05.000]   Devices the smart things hub and if you go to smart things comm slash twit you could take a look at their home security and solution kits
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.600]   They started on $189 and we're gonna get to 10% off plus free shipping in the US if you use the offer code twit
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.320]   This thing the I'm just so thrilled to see this every year
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.840]   I would go to CES and look at the home automation pavilion and be disappointed
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:26.600]   Because it was a tower of babble smart things cut through cuts through all that and I guess that kind of explains why they won the
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.000]   CES 2015 editor's choice award. This is a
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   great product that solves a real need I
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.120]   Want you to try it for water detection energy savings security home automation? There's nothing better
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:46.040]   And it works with everything else smart things you can see actually on the other websites smart things calm slash twit

[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.120]   We love it. I
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:14.800]   Think this is interesting, you know Samsung's been sourcing the chips for the iPhone and iPad now for some time
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:18.360]   We'd heard rumors that Apple was looking at another foundry in fact
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.880]   According to Apple insider has made a sudden
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:30.920]   last minute decision to source 30% of the next generation a 9 chips from this second foundry T is it TM
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:39.160]   TS MC 30% the one that made the a not the eight they went well they did make the AA yeah, so
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:46.080]   Do I have Samsung chips in my phone or right now you if you have an iPhone 6 you have TM SC
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.120]   Oh interesting
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.720]   But there was some reports that's because Samsung has limited capacity like any fab
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.680]   They don't have an abundance of capacity that because they're busy fabbing all the ex and those chipsets that they might Apple might need to
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.120]   Have a second supplier for yeah, they're galaxy
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:06.400]   Galaxy Edge uses X and O's not they've always used in their Galaxy phones X and O's in Europe and Asia
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:13.000]   But the US has always had Qualcomm chips for the first time ever the edge has an X and O's chip globally
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.480]   Although still has the Qualcomm baseband for hash for Verizon. Yeah for Verizon for CDMA and that wonderful little sticker
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.160]   That they're forced to put on the rise in really yeah, there's a power by quality
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.200]   It's like an Intel inside yeah, you come on the bottom of the Verizon version
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:31.720]   Jason you just got the S6 normal. I have the edge
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.600]   Yeah, I'm loving it
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:40.240]   It's a pretty fantastic phone now. We should say Jason's the enemy he works for all about the enemy
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.240]   At best frenemy
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:52.000]   adversary yeah friendly adversary so the question I have and maybe Jason and so I was using one for two days
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.640]   Earlier last week and I turned it sideways and none of the ports are aligned and I can't unsee that
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:05.640]   Like the sim card thing is not aligned with the buttons like the mic knob is not the mic hole is not aligned with the
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.800]   micro USB port
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:13.160]   You're just weird. Yeah, I got look at these things and like how hard is that to do just do that for me, please wait a minute
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:19.880]   You want to look at it are they aligned my so you're saying because here on this beautiful Apple iPhone everything is is
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.000]   See here like rigidly aligned, but you're saying on
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.240]   Huh cameras pulled out now that you've told me this I probably won't be able to unsee it. Okay, so that's the iPhone
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:34.760]   They're all in line. They're all in a straight line same thing here. Yeah, I mean I mean I guess so
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.000]   Because I never noticed it before but pull it zooming in
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   Oh, not gonna be able to unsee it
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.840]   Not a reason to reject the phone, but you're making excellent. I like them to do it
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:56.160]   The infrared sensor is above that's exactly what is Apple is like obsessive like yeah
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.400]   That stuff
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:05.240]   Well now we have to look thanks
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.560]   When the Galaxy S7 is perfectly aligned they can thank Mac break weekly
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:14.280]   It is pretty funny
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.760]   The camera I just have to say the camera
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:23.920]   Finally finally I use an Android phone and I'm amazed by the first really good and right five years for of Android devices
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.240]   For me to finally be super
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:34.920]   Impressed by camera excellent review at a non-detect very thorough review at an on tech and he did say that he still considers
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.280]   The iPhone camera marginally better probably because it's only 8 megapixels
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:43.640]   He does point out that on the edge when you have a 16 megapixel camera with a sensor that size
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:48.040]   That means the pixels on the sensor about a micron, which is pretty darn small
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.240]   They chop them up really small. Yeah, and so you know, maybe he's a little over
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:59.120]   Like you a little over involved in these that's
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:04.000]   But so for me a camera on a phone should just be a big most people most of the time
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.700]   People to pull out of their pocket and with absolutely no adjustment take a photograph and they had a good memory
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:17.880]   Yeah, and I was and I use it I use a I use a highly subjective criterion for pictures that I call pleasingness
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.760]   Yes
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:25.920]   Because I you know and and admittedly sometimes a picture that's not perfectly accurate is more pleasing than a picture
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.340]   That is perfectly accurate if I go off and some people like warmer some people like cooler
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:34.700]   Very personal sometimes and I've always thought the iPhone particularly the iPhone 6 and 6 plus even more so
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.280]   I had a very high pleasing this factor
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:41.520]   I mean you just like you looked at the image and you liked them. You said yeah, that's what I saw
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.820]   That's how it felt animals right now. He thinks we're absolute animals right now. Who does Alex?
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:48.580]   You animal you
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:57.380]   Know I I shoot 95% of my photos with my iPhone. Yeah, I don't I really take my SLR out DSLR out very
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:03.340]   Very rarely I mean take it out for very specific things and sometimes you know about a couple times a year
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:06.800]   I capture things with my kids that I won't want in that that format
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.380]   But but really the thing that I shoot almost exclusively is my iPhone
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:16.260]   You know it's the thing that's in my pocket my DSLR and even micro four-thirds. I tried to go to that
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:24.020]   There is so little room in my case, you know my my bags that I travel that anything more than about that size
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:28.420]   Is is a problem for me and so so I've gotten I've gotten quite used to it
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.380]   And I've gotten pretty good at taking those photos
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:35.700]   But that in my little 360 data or whatever pretty much the only cameras that I have most of the time
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:40.820]   It's amazing now that and in fact I think in many ways your smartphone is is
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:43.700]   Primary function is your case. It's your camera
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:50.740]   People use it statistically it is the primary function of your camera is I mean of your phone is a camera
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:56.700]   And I think that one of the things that you know the integration like my kids love the fact that that my Apple TV is
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:03.220]   Connected to my photo stream. So I'm just like constantly taking photos and they love that they come home and they see wherever I was
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:06.860]   Just things just appearing all the time, you know
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:13.020]   Of whatever I'm doing they and they they stay connected and I think that's actually a piece of what I like about
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:17.820]   About it. I think with DSLRs then I have to figure out where to put it and do all this other stuff with this
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:21.340]   I just online. It's on my computer. It's on everything. I need it needed to be on
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:26.280]   I don't think about it. What were you saying? Don? No, I was gonna say exactly the same thing that yet
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:33.100]   The photos are great and the images are fine, but the convenience of you know the the connectivity that they have and also geo location
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:37.740]   I mean if you think back a couple years how hard it was to actually do geo location and put that information on
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.300]   You know when we were in China, it's just done
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:44.540]   I was carrying with me John and I went to China and I wanted to geek cruises
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:49.940]   And I was carrying a GPS dongle a little dongle. That's right
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:55.740]   And you'd have to and I mean it was just crazy and then you'd get home and you'd use a tool
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:59.580]   I think it was from Huda that would yeah, who did you take the K?
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:06.620]   Yeah, who do geo would take the KML file from the GPS dongle and match it because you had to have the time right and then it would
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:09.380]   Match them and then they were geo located and now it's just
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:16.260]   Notice with photos because I mean I've started to use a little mirrorless camera as well
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.740]   And which is great for travel and that's nice images
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:21.660]   But you know there's no geo location on there and with the new photos
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.980]   You can't actually get that information in in photos
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:31.060]   You have to use them like who did you to actually put the the geo location information on and it's it's such a pain the butt
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:38.180]   Well, and I think I love the the iPhoto map or the photo map, you know and where the thing
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:43.340]   You know, I have to admit sometimes I fall a little behind I didn't realize like I just searched by location
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:46.220]   You know and until a couple weeks ago, and I was like, oh my gosh
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:51.180]   Do we have there's a new photos do that or is yeah, they didn't yep, okay good
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.580]   And so you can sit there and go and and go
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:58.140]   I just want to show you all the pictures from Rwanda or if I'm looking for pictures from my house
[01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:02.620]   I just I just go to those and that map is is this great map of for me
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:06.620]   It's just it's this great memory trip of all these different places that I've you know traveled
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:12.180]   And I love the fact that everything's just getting tagged and everything else except when I post it and I worry about
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:17.700]   We're all using we've all we've all replaced if you've updated iOS 283 and you've updated
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:22.180]   You 70 to 10 10 3 bye bye iPhoto hello photos
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:26.420]   And we've been talking a lot about that, but now it's real for everybody
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:30.300]   What do we think I?
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.260]   Mean I love it
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:39.020]   Especially with iCloud photo library because it really does deliver on that like near line storage promise where all my frequently accessed
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:43.460]   Favorites and recent photos are available on every single one of my devices my less frequently
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:46.500]   You know an unfavored photos are just stored up in the cloud
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:52.500]   I can get them with a tap of an iCloud button and it means that I don't I don't have to worry my entire library is available everywhere
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:57.740]   I do download one caught like I have one Mac my iMac downloads everything and backs it up to time machine just in
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.220]   No in case Apple servers ever explode, but I
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:05.900]   It's working great for me. I've been using it for two or three months now and we put up
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:11.740]   I think 50 help articles three guides and a bunch of reviews and it's just been really good people have been complaining
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:15.500]   That the iCloud photo library sync never completes
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:19.580]   Takes a while especially with a big second while yeah
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:27.140]   And do you recommend when you now obviously when you're on a phone you're gonna have optimized the iPhone storage because then it downloads
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:31.900]   It doesn't download the full originals of everything it does some very smart stuff
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:36.540]   So that you don't fill up your iPhone with photos, but you get access to all your photos
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.980]   Do you recommend that on a Mac as well?
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:43.420]   With a small SSD drive absolutely like a MacBook Air or one of the new Mac books
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:45.580]   Yeah, because those will fill up really quick
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:49.660]   They do a really good job of stopping before you get completely full on your drive
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:55.580]   But with the optimized storage it oftentimes you don't need especially the raw the raw information all available all the time
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.580]   So it'll just leave that in the cloud until you want it
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.820]   And if you want to make sure that certain photos are highly available
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:04.940]   Just you know open them before you go out or favorite them or do something that that prompts the system
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:09.260]   Think of it like a fusion drive whatever you do more frequently is gonna end up right there on the computer for you
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:13.900]   How okay, so the by the way there's somebody in the chat room saying no photos doesn't do maps
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:17.100]   It isn't obvious. There's not you know in the new photos
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.820]   You have photos shared albums and projects tabs
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:24.500]   But if you're in the photos tab you'll see that they are geo located
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:30.100]   And if you click the geo location of any given group it will launch a map
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:35.580]   And and that map you can move around in right and see where other photos are and so forth
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:41.260]   Yeah, I mean I've been playing a lot with photos this week because it's actually the topic of this week show so good
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:45.540]   I'm very very very intimated with it a minute, but no I like it
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:48.260]   I mean there are some of the advanced tools that aren't there in aperture
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.740]   And yeah, I don't think that the majority of people are really gonna miss them
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:56.860]   If you really heavily into photography and you like using the brushes etc, you know, it's gonna be
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.580]   But yeah, yeah, if you want to do that get like room
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:04.420]   But again my take on on photos is it is still a version one product
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.820]   As Renee says the iCloud photo library
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:12.860]   Just is the answer to all my prayers of workflow because I used to get in such a mess before with having the iPad and the iPhone and
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:17.500]   You know you did it something on one device and then that added version would remain on there
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:21.140]   And then you know it was a complete mess, but with iCloud photo library
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:24.540]   You know things do think eventually when you give it time if you've got a big library
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:29.740]   And it's just such a delight to you know edit something on your iPad and then literally within seconds
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:33.540]   You know it's a new Mac or it's on it's on your iPhone as well the edited version plus
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:36.940]   It's non-destructive so you can if you want to revert you can revert as well
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:39.740]   But but I think that you know it's a version one product
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:45.220]   They're going down the same route that they did with final cut they're going down the same route that did with pages and numbers in that they've
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:51.340]   basically started again from scratch and they've built the architecture underneath and they've produced this first version
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:53.700]   They haven't opened any of the APIs yet
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:55.420]   So that there's no plugins on the Mac etc
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:25:00.780]   But I'm sure that's to come and I'm sure we'll see lots of these more advanced features in aperture that we had
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:03.620]   Reappear within photos for those people who want to use it
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:10.420]   But as a version one product it's probably more than suitable for you know over 80% of people who like to play with photos
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.420]   I hadn't yet installed
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:19.020]   Turn it on on because I just upgraded this laptop to 10 10 3 and it's so cool because you trust as soon as you turn on iCloud
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:23.620]   Photo library all these images from you know way back when?
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.140]   Are now available to me?
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:30.940]   I mean here's pictures from our visits to London in the fall in October you get ton of space back on your device
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:36.220]   Yeah, a lot of people were running out of space. I look the thing to Don's point is there's no photo extensions for OS 10
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:40.900]   Yet those are only iOS but it's not hard to imagine that that's next on the list for OS 10
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:44.460]   And you know there's a new version of Lightroom that's available today
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:46.340]   And you know there's a lot of features for photographers
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:52.620]   But for somebody who just wants to manage all their stuff and not have to worry about it the feature set it's it's complete ish
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:56.300]   It's there's not everything here, but there's a lot of stuff you can do. Yeah
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:26:03.980]   It's a it's not all completely discoverable like that maps thing it takes a little time to kind of move around within it also does video
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.980]   Which is nice?
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:09.620]   Yeah, I think this is a good I think this is a good
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:13.740]   Middle ground and the and the iCloud photo library
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:18.580]   Have you heard of sinking issues or is it just that people have so many images?
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:25.100]   Yeah, I had a problem today and someone asked because I put out a thing on Twitter asking people
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:30.780]   What would they like to for me to cover on someone did mention sinking and people are finding they are having gaps in the cash?
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:35.340]   You know so that when you see the thumbnails they're like sort of spaces sometimes they've done completely
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:38.980]   It's a little it's a little image with a cloud in it, but no image itself. Yeah
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:44.060]   I see you if you drill down normally you see at the top level you'll see blanks
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:50.620]   Yeah, but normally when you drill down to that level if you give it a few minutes it normally and that looks like that's that's actually an error
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:55.780]   That's probably a video that's not supported. Okay. You've seen quite a few of these however
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:27:01.660]   So yeah, there's something so but I but I just started thinking when we started talking about it
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:04.540]   So yeah, I'm pretty impressed at the range of stuff
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:10.180]   That's already one of the one of the really cool things is that there's photo kit which developers can plug into so for example
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:14.340]   Google updated snap seed last week and I love snap seed and they they use photo kit
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:17.460]   So that that fits right into the non destructive editing pipeline
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.140]   So anything you do with with
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:22.340]   Snapseed now gets preserved in photos you can go back and undo it
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:26.740]   And if more apps start doing that then it becomes really sort of exciting because you don't just have plugins
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:30.460]   But you have a lot of our non destructive that sync that do all that as well. I'd love that
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:37.100]   Yeah, yeah, the other thing the people are a little bit concerned about is having to pay for the cloud storage because obviously if you're just using a
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.780]   Free five gig account, it's not gonna sort of hold a lot of photos
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:43.540]   So they've they've got tears that you can boost the storage
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:48.260]   But you know if you don't want that they they have given you a sort of get-out as well in that you can have multiple
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:54.620]   Photos libraries and because it's only the one library on your Mac that will actually synchronize with iCloud photo library
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:58.380]   So you can sign one library to sync and then have other libraries
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:01.540]   You know for archive or if it's just stuff that you don't want to sync between your devices
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:04.380]   You can hold that in separate libraries as well. Oh, that's nice
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:10.220]   Yeah, so you kind of it's a bit difficult to move photos from one library to another at the moment
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:11.020]   Okay, you know
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:17.100]   You can keep them in separate libraries and then just switch use the old trick of hold down the altar option key when you load photos
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:19.340]   And that well I would just like that's very good to know
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:23.820]   So if you're gonna import stuff that you don't want to put on iCloud for instance
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:29.300]   You could do that hold down the alt key when you launch photos and say yeah create a new one
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:34.040]   And you'll have now if you've got you know if you've got a huge aperture library like I did my
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.220]   After library contained hundreds of 4k video clips
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:43.520]   Which you know a huge in size and I don't really I'm gonna use them to to edit and make a you know a smaller movie
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.680]   So I didn't really want all those clips to be
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:53.260]   Uploaded so I basically before I migrated my actual library just exported all those 4k clips into you know a separate partition
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:58.740]   Deleted them from the actual library and then just migrated my actual library and it was a lot smaller by the time I'd done that you know
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:05.000]   So there are ways you can you can massage and manipulate what actually does get uploaded to iCloud photo
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.660]   Jason Snow writes an article a couple weeks ago in six colors comm
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:14.380]   About an experience it was a little odd now he has 20,000
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:19.100]   photos in a family photo collection and
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:23.540]   It started upload he says last later that they discovered something
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:29.780]   The next day my internet connection seemed to die or at least become sporadically inert traffic would sometimes
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:36.660]   Score through but after long days long delays it was weird and intermittent and I was really sad as I would be as well
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:41.100]   Later that day I discovered something though even though I photos wasn't open a
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:46.700]   Background task was uploading my photo library to iCloud all 20,000
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:51.700]   Photos this process was using all available bandwidth. It was what not what we call nice
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:56.820]   Saturating my outbound internet connection, which means your downloads will also be
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:05.940]   throttled if you're trying out photos and wondering why you're in it is suddenly slow now you know you can pause for one day
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:11.060]   That's a button right there in the settings for iCloud photo library
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:14.580]   Are you aware of this Renee have you seen this?
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:20.420]   Yeah, there was a big debate about whether it was uploading in the background or not and different Jason was showing you know
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:26.260]   screenshots of network activity to prove that it really was and again like it's even if photos is closed
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:32.900]   Yeah, yeah, it's an agent is it yeah, it's a demon or an agent. I forget the technical term
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:37.220]   The thing is though that button or looks has pause for a day
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:40.380]   You can actually just pause it and it turns into a resume button
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:45.340]   So if you just want to pause it for a couple of hours you can you can press that then right you know if you're working during the day
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.900]   Just press that and then leave it on overnight and just press resume
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:51.980]   I'm just once it's done. It'll be you know done. Yeah, but that's bad programming
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:56.700]   It should be you know when you have backblazer carbonite our sponsor people like that even iTunes
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:59.260]   They'll be careful about using your upstream
[01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:05.060]   I'll give you the option to toggle it you know or to slide that to you know change the amount of time get it done
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:06.900]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:11.420]   You're very careful if you're if you accidentally have a my fine that it accidentally
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:15.140]   Yeah, do it if you had a bandwidth cap you should
[01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:21.020]   You know you want to bandwidth cap what you don't want is to have a limit where you're then paying ten dollars a gig out
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:24.820]   Right just in case you're wondering it it adds up over time. Yeah. Yeah
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:29.980]   This is actually a problem a lot of a lot of programs have and something
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:34.060]   Something new with this cloud storage thing
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:41.700]   But just it could to be aware of it still amazes me that I mean Apple have always suffered with a bad press on
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:46.460]   Cloud and web and justly so you know in the early days with a mobile me etc
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:51.340]   But they really do seem to have got their act together now when you consider the amount of data that they're you know
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:54.940]   Pushing down or pulling up when you look at the music look at the movies with iTunes
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:59.540]   You look at all the apps for the Mac and for the for iOS and now the iCloud photo library
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:03.860]   You know the sheer volume of traffic they must be handling now is it's open to the public
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:09.700]   Not just a beta so anyone now can upload you know 200 gigs of data. I mean that's where I'm pushing up at the minute
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:13.140]   I'm I've converted my actual library. It's about 250 gig
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:17.700]   I'm about I only started it two days ago and I've been switching it off during the day while I work and just leave
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:23.060]   And about halfway it's probably I probably about a third of the way through but it's it's it's getting up there
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:28.860]   You know, there's no way to say don't don't put this album on the cloud. You just have to open a new create a new library
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:33.040]   Yeah, it's everything within a library goes. It's called your system photo library
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:36.100]   That's the one that actually gets syncs with with iCloud photo library
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:39.260]   It's meant to be sort of set it and forget it
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:43.020]   It's made so that you can take the humans out of photo management. They want to do it all intelligently for you
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:49.660]   Which is great if it what it does is is what you want it to do. Yes, but as you get more sophisticated
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:55.500]   Maybe it isn't it's like time machine and a lot of other. Yeah, it's exactly like that. Yeah, Apple always airs on the side of you know
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.500]   It's just magic
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:02.420]   But sometimes magic can be black magic for those who one sometimes
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:07.480]   The time goes on like like now they've added to time machine where you can you can prevent it from backing up certain folders
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:13.220]   I wouldn't be surprised that stuff slowly begins to appear in photos over time and I think they presume correctly in most cases
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:17.700]   That if you're that sophisticated, you just disable it and you'll do your own thing
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:23.380]   You'll you'll know what to do. It's really yeah, you'll use or whatever you'll yeah, exactly
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:24.140]   so
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.460]   This is for people who don't know better and will be in
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:32.700]   99% of the case just happy the problem is I wish they would document a little bit better
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:37.340]   So that we could we the more sophisticated users could say oh, I don't want that I
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:40.460]   Prefer not to have that
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:48.300]   On the other hand, I'm loving the fact that for the even though I'm using this machine for the first time with Yosemite 10 10 3
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:52.620]   I got all my pictures on here. That's nice without clogging my hard drive
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:57.580]   It's even more amazing on your phone. You just pull out your phone in a picture from 2007 that great the grandparents
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:01.140]   All is right there. Yeah, what do we know what the algorithms are for?
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:05.020]   How much how many originals to put on there how many thumb there, you know
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.060]   They explained it
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.020]   It's and I'm gonna forget I'm not gonna get it right
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:14.860]   But basically they see how much storage space you have left and if you have optimized storage on what it'll do is
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:21.260]   Upload the originals and replace them with with sizes that are optimized for the screen of the device that you're using and then any photo
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:26.820]   That you've taken recently that you've opened recently or that you've favored it will get priority for for caching locally
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:31.620]   Anything that's old or you haven't looked at in a long time will be prioritized for cloud storage
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:36.820]   So it's it is basically a near line algorithm. That's a real. I think that's a really good way to do it. Yeah
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:44.620]   Very nice. All right. Let's see what else is going on in the world of I forget we skipped over Apple bought the camera company links
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.980]   Yeah, what is that for? What are they gonna do with them?
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:55.420]   L is it LY and X L N L I N capital X. I it's an imaging company from Israel. What does links do?
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:58.220]   Links I mean this is marketing hype
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:03.340]   But they say they want to make iPhone cameras as good as DSLR cameras and they're using a bunch of 3d imaging technology to sort of
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:07.940]   Super sample and get depth information and other information to try to boost the quality of small camera
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:12.020]   They have multiple sensors in some cases as many as four sensors in a single
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:16.920]   Camera and this is and this is very similar. I mean this is a similar technology to like throw
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.700]   It's a similar technology to what Sam's or what?
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:23.940]   HTC is done with the with the M8 M9
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:30.580]   So you know the idea is with a little bit of parallax you can you can get a lot of information about how far things are away
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:34.220]   And then you can start selectively grabbing things and creating short top the field
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:36.860]   There's all kinds of things you can do with these lenses
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:41.580]   I mean that's that that is the simplest of the things that you can do once you're gathering that information
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:45.260]   So there's you know and I do think that this is going to be the future right now
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:52.060]   We're seeing a handful of cameras with this. I wouldn't be surprised if most cameras had this in 10 years some version of this
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:58.180]   This is the press release from links before they got bought Apple bought only paid 20 million. It's cheap
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:01.860]   Tom Guba rumored that I think what's yeah
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:07.120]   Tom Guba had a rumor. I think what's takes six months ago that Apple is doing this with their cameras a well played John. Yeah
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:10.860]   Or well leaked Apple one of the other
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:12.860]   It would make sense
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:18.340]   The press release from last year and links says the image quality of mobile cameras has reached a dead end
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:25.220]   I think you're seeing this with the with the edge where you're putting 16 megapixels in but they're sort of mic sub micron pixels
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:33.140]   The vice makers are striving to differentiate using imaging capabilities, but the pixel size race is ended and the next generation cameras
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:37.500]   Do not reveal any dramatic improvements links camera. It really is. It's about software
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:43.360]   You know right now, but this is a hardware innovation that might make a big difference links cameras revolutionize
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:49.860]   Mobile photography and broaden the usability span and user experience allowing us to leave our SLRs at home
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:55.300]   It uses the extra lenses to extract depth information
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:58.860]   So you could do 3d image reconstruction
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:02.460]   You could of course you know
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:09.300]   With depth sensitivity you can do multiple variable variable focus as the LITRO does
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:19.020]   Should be Apple smart this look Apple needs to I mean there a tendency has for a long time been in the iPhone has been
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:26.900]   Partially powered by the strength of their camera. There's just nothing is good and you gotta stay ahead because people are starting to catch up now
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:30.540]   Neil sibern had a great article on above Alvin one yesterday about the
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:35.740]   Importance of the camera because it's one of the features that people will upgrade early for if you can prove you can prove
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:41.260]   The camera substantially better than maybe 10% more people will upgrade that year and that translates into a lot of money
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:43.260]   It's gonna be in the seven right not the success
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:46.820]   It's it's hard to tell the success will have the same body
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.700]   But you know they can do a lot with a camera even within the same body
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:53.900]   I'd be really surprised to see anything before 2016 because we're stuck
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:55.660]   I mean really well
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:58.820]   We don't know because Apple I mean they could do whatever they want
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:05.340]   But the last few generations that the second iteration of a new design has not modified the body
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:09.020]   Right, so you still would have this camera at this size camera hole
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:12.380]   Or could you could you make it a bigger millibigre?
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:19.420]   Hole and a change the motherboard significantly would that be an S they have so much money Leo. I know they do anything they want
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:23.980]   I mean they couldn't make the bump a little bigger couldn't it because they've already started educators with having a
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:29.940]   Prominence on the outside so they could actually you know stick that up by another millimeter or two the S6 has quite a bump
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:33.820]   Actually, the five S had touch ID. I mean they swapped they added touch ID is up
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:37.140]   Which is a hardware feature to the right. That's a new that's a new device. Okay. All right
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:42.020]   I think that the issue is I think they're probably in the landing phase of manufacturing already
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:44.140]   I mean if they're you know my god. Can you believe that?
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:47.460]   I mean first they're the next for the next version for something in the fall
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:51.780]   They're gonna need they're gonna know that they need and they'll know down to the million
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:56.700]   Of what they need right but and they probably have 10 or 15 million that need to be
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:00.780]   Produced minimum. I think there's a huge surge in in the sixth and success
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:03.500]   I don't think I mean I'm sorry the six and six plus
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:09.420]   I'm not sure that the surge will be quite the same, you know for the success just because it was that there was a lot of pent up demand
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:17.620]   Kudos to Apple buying up 36,000 acres of forest in partnership with a conservation fund
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:20.660]   Apple does use a little bit of paper
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:22.500]   and
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:29.140]   The land which are in is in Maine in North Carolina. It's land roughly twice the size of Manhattan
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:36.060]   45 million part of a 45 million acre private forest in the US that is in danger being lost due to development
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:40.100]   So Apple acquired these and will harvest pulp
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:43.580]   from these forests for its virgin paper needs
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:47.420]   Probably for the boxes
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:50.580]   I'm sure those are made from virgin paper
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:57.080]   but you know done properly wood is a renewable resource and
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:04.300]   Instead of clear-cutting this forest and putting housing complexes up that the trees will stay they'll harvest them
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:09.340]   I mean if you think about it
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:15.260]   When you sell hundreds of millions of devices every year each in its own
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.540]   perfectly crafted square box
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:22.220]   You got a lot of non recyclable
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:28.660]   Non-recycled fiber they say about one third of the paper packaging of the iOS devices is non-recycled fiber
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:36.380]   And I think Apple gets pinched a lot on whether you know the environmental impact of of what they're doing
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:38.940]   So I think that I think this is probably just the beginning
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:44.140]   This is a great step in in the process of them taking more control over their supply chain
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:48.180]   It feels like they're almost getting to a point where they could have and they have the cash to do it if they wanted to
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:54.340]   Build almost a vertical market where they're literally pulling the I mean completely vertical where they're literally pulling
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:56.820]   The content out of the ground
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:59.900]   And this trees is the beginning of this but it could be
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:03.800]   You know rare earth metals all kinds of other things where they're actually
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:10.580]   Owning a big chunk of that and managing it the way they want to manage it and then having it all you own it all the way to the end
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:13.340]   Maybe they'll start making the boxes out of wood
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.420]   What why do they need me paper for make a matter of wood?
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:19.100]   You got the wood
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:23.900]   There you go. Apple's got wood now 36,000 acres of wood. I
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:27.140]   Like wooden boxes
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:30.340]   We got our high-end mics came in wooden boxes for a long time
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:34.260]   Are you making us something of that kind of quality?
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:39.580]   I would do the does the addition come in a fine it comes in it's got a very fancy box. Yeah, is it cardboard?
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:40.540]   I
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:43.980]   Don't know I didn't ask what it was made out of it looks very fancy. Yeah
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:50.940]   Fancy box, but anyway, there is a precedent for this remember Henry Ford when he built the Rouge factory
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:56.500]   Which still runs in Dearborn, Michigan? The whole idea was that you put?
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:59.140]   box cars of
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:01.140]   trees and
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:02.100]   and
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:06.060]   In gets of iron in on one end and a car comes out the other end
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:11.140]   Because they have forges and they have mills and they have everything you need in the Rouge factory
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:13.380]   Which is a massive factory?
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:16.020]   But if you look at I mean what's now disbanded
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:18.500]   I mean we think of them as as a coffee coffee makers
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:23.820]   But crops really owned everything from the they were crops arms and they owned everything from the mining
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:30.980]   Organizations that pulled it out of the ground all the way to the finished guns that they they output it if you're big enough
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:33.820]   It's a way to do it
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:36.780]   Alright couple of let's wrap up with a few things
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:43.500]   We did mention the LA Unified school districts purchase of a large number of iPads one for each student
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:44.640]   in the district
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:49.580]   They issued a 30 year bond to pay for it which seemed on the face of it bad fiscal policy
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:52.140]   The the program was a
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:43:00.660]   Incredible flop they're being investigated because they no longer but at the time superintendent there had ties to Apple and Pearson
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:07.660]   Which is the publishing company that made the curriculum to go on these iPads. They bought the curriculum site unseen
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:11.420]   There's complaints now. It never worked in Apple is now saying app
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:15.260]   I mean LA Unified school district is now saying that Apple we want our money back
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:18.940]   We want our money back
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:21.180]   This is a real clear
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:27.580]   When you think about Pearson and you think about putting that putting the content onto iPads this is a classic case of
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:33.500]   New wine and old wineskins. I mean, you know the the issue is is that it is a
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:36.820]   You know there they have this old
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:42.580]   Technology being books and I get that there they try to spruce it up with making a couple things interactive
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:47.500]   But but really, you know for this kind of thing to work for most of these school systems
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.940]   I'd like to really build your entire curriculum around it
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:56.940]   It's gonna require a complete rethinking of the education process and I don't think I don't think most public schools are ready for that
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:03.980]   1.3 billion dollars in iPads it failed almost immediately was rolled out in fall 2013
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:10.100]   The devices didn't work teachers weren't well trained. They often would put the devices aside. I think the the
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:16.060]   Motivation was good, which is there are a lot of poor kids in our district who do not have access to technology
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:21.140]   And we want to make sure that they have access to technology whether an iPad is exactly the right thing
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:28.020]   Well, and I think that I think under underlining I think the teachers didn't jump on it the teachers didn't take it much advantage of it
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:29.260]   I think there's a lot of other problems
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:33.940]   but if you look at like the Baltimore school district actually put smartboards in every single
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:37.060]   classroom that they had and
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:40.700]   Almost, you know all but like one or two of the teachers just used it as a blackboard
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:46.540]   They just right understand it didn't you know and there just wasn't enough training enough enough for them to see why they should
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:49.060]   Do more work to figure that out. Yeah?
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:58.820]   Well, it's really as much Pearson's problem as it is apples, but the school districts that we're not paying for anymore
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:02.020]   iPads, thank you very much, and we'd like our money back
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:09.180]   I have it feels like they probably aren't gonna have much success with that approach going around snatching iPads with kids hands
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:18.220]   The YouTube app has disappeared from older Apple TV and iOS devices
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:21.580]   Wasn't it replaced by a newer better app?
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:26.660]   YouTube is apparently changing its data API. I'm any of those older apps
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:32.580]   Just won't function if you have an old second generation or earlier Apple TV the YouTube channel just
[01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:40.220]   Be gone iPhone iPad iPod touch iOS 7 or later is required for YouTube
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:42.900]   to work so
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:47.980]   That's not an Apple thing. That's that's a that's a Google thing. They've changed the API
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:52.600]   Although Apple I guess is responsible for the YouTube app on
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:56.740]   The Apple TV at least a channel partnership
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:46:02.060]   So like if it's the same as Bloomberg then they get a kit that lets them develop the app that gets put on them I see
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:06.420]   I think all the other devices that you can still get to YouTube through my boss of fun
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:11.300]   He's just the right to the Apple TV browser works. Right, but there's no browser on the Apple TV
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:16.500]   10.10.4 see the developers get ready. Oh, yeah, and 8.4. Oh
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:22.420]   What did they do what did I get when I got it last week? What did I get?
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:29.780]   So 8.2 was all the watch stuff 8.3 takes all the stuff that Apple's iOS engineers have been working on and mixes that with the watch stuff and
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:34.660]   Gives you like it's basically the next version of iOS the other one was the same was the same as iOS 8.1
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:39.300]   But with the watch stuff now you're getting the next version of iOS that combines the watch stuff into it
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:44.980]   And you also got the emoji like the the diversified emoji with all the flags and and extra things like that
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:51.300]   And then iOS 8.4 has been seeded and according to some websites who've published pictures of it. There's a new music app
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:53.460]   Huh?
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:55.460]   That would be the beats
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:58.340]   There's no beats yet, but it's a redesigned music app so far
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:03.060]   But it might be the front end for things front ends for something. We don't even know what they're gonna call
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:10.660]   You did mention briefly. We should probably mention lightroom six came out today from adobe. Have you played with it Alex?
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:15.540]   Do you know anything about it? I have not um, I I'll ask more from my sister
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:19.780]   I'm gonna play with it. I I'm still figuring out what I'm gonna do post aperture
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:29.140]   Uh, so I'm I'm definitely looking at it. Um, my my sister uses lightroom heavily. So, uh, I'm gonna let her give me some guidance as do I
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:36.500]   I think they introduced facial recognition and some some new hdr features and also some um some stitching of
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:41.460]   panoramic shots including stitching of raw photos and panoramas as well
[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:44.820]   Also fully 64 bit in all versions
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:50.500]   If you're a creative cloud subscriber as I am, which is by the way one of the best deals out there 10 dollars a month gives you yeah
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.260]   Photoshop
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:55.460]   And lightroom and automatically updates to the next version every time
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:59.540]   Uh, you should be getting that or getting a notice to get that
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:04.820]   Face recognition. I don't care so much about hmm. Um speed improvements
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:07.940]   uh new new tools and brushes
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:11.140]   um
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:12.100]   a
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:18.900]   Because I guess the faces is kind of like apple faces, which is in photos and I photo an aperture high dynamic range tool
[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:25.940]   I've been using external tool called photomatics to do, uh, hdr. I guess I could try light rooms now
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:33.700]   So if you have light room, uh, upgrade, there'll probably be a paid upgrade for lightroom five users on this on a standalone version
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:37.620]   We'll take a break come back gentlemen prepare your picks

[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:12.180]   Time for picks of the week. Let's start with rene richy
[01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:18.340]   So i'm we're going to be inundated with apple watch app starting friday and I wanted to get in ahead of the crowd
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:23.700]   Uh, twitterific is the granddaddy of twitter apps. It was it's it's where a lot of the iconography
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:26.820]   We know like the bird came from twitterific tweet came from twitterific
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:31.540]   It symbolizes so much of what we now consider to be twitter and they were there the first they were there in jailbreak
[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:34.500]   They were there the first day of the app store first day of the ipad app store
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:39.620]   I'm convinced if an apple tv SDK comes out there they would already be working on twitterific for that
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:45.460]   So it's it's hard to be surprised that they have twitterific already ready to go for the apple watch
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:51.540]   Uh, they put up a little teaser uh blog site about it and you know as as is to be expected from the icon factory
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:55.940]   It looks gorgeous. Uh, you can have the little mascot ollie right there on your wrist
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:52:00.900]   And it's for me one of the biggest things about the apple watch is going to be notification triage
[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:06.740]   I have very few notifications on very almost none of them can actually make the my phone sound at all
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:09.300]   Uh, and there's I do dms on twitter
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:10.420]   I don't do very much else
[01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:15.140]   But being able to just quickly glance at something and see a short look and bring it closer and see a long look
[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:18.100]   And know if it's important if I need to stop and take care of it
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.260]   Uh, it's going to be really important and there's the twitter app but more and more often
[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:27.780]   It feels like twitter's interests aren't my interests and sort of the decisions they're making with interface and with features
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:32.020]   Aren't the decisions that I want from twitter, but um twitterific has always been just
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:35.300]   Exactly what what I've wanted a classic twitter client
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:39.620]   Uh, and you can get the update now it won't work until you get your apple watch of course
[01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:41.620]   But it's already baked in and it's going to be ready to go
[01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:44.580]   Love the icon factory. They do such great stuff
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:47.860]   They're true beautiful beautiful stuff. Oh, I can't wait
[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:52.260]   Just die and I can use serie to send a tweet using that right?
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:56.660]   I I'm I'm it'll probably use the built-in twitter functionality of iOS
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:53:01.220]   It won't go but you don't need it too because all you're doing is sending a tweet is going to be a system function at that point
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:03.780]   Can't wait
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:06.180]   Twitterific I use a tweet bot
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:10.660]   I do too on the iPhone because it reminds me of tweedy, which is just how my brain works
[01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:13.460]   Tweety the original
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:19.700]   But I and twitter tweedy was bought by twitter. Lauren britter made it and then they basically destroyed it and made the new twitter app
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:24.740]   And tweet bot just reminds me of that but I've always used twitterific on the ipad because they have a combined timeline
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:28.740]   So it's a very enjoyable reading experience. I'm gonna do it. Okay, so for twitterific for the ipad
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:35.460]   Yeah, tweet bot for the uh iphone and we'll see for the uh, iWatch the apple watch, which is the best
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:39.940]   I presume we bought for apple watch yet. Not yet, but I presume everybody's got to be working on that right?
[01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:42.020]   It can't be too hard to do or is it
[01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:46.420]   Uh, so the notifications are almost for free basically any notification you currently have now
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:49.460]   We'll just work on the watch you can add some fine graying controls
[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:55.060]   I believe if you want to then you can also make a glance which is like a widget and you can also make a watchkit extension
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:57.860]   Which gives you interactivity and that's what twitterific has done
[01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:03.140]   tweet bot and the other clients would have to make those glances and widgets as well imagine everybody's gonna be doing
[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:10.100]   Some people want to wait they want to see they want to take their time and see what inter because the hardest thing so far has been figuring out what makes sense
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:13.940]   Because um ben bajaren's ben bajaren said this you have hours on the computer
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:19.300]   You have minutes on the phone and you have seconds on the watch because people just don't want to leave their wrist up for a long period of time
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:23.780]   Right so figuring out what the most important functionality is and giving that takes a little bit of thought
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:29.460]   And I know several really good developers who want to wait and have a watch for a week or a month before they figure out what they want to do with it
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:35.940]   mr. Don mccallister screencasts online your recommendation
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:40.100]   Right well i've gotten with a gadget this time rather than application
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:46.660]   Like it's something that came in really handy on a holiday recently and it's this this is the and it's you need to see this on video
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:53.700]   But it's the feyotec hand-held gimbal hand-held gimbal for your um go pro
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:59.780]   And it just basically stabilizes your go pro and turns it into a steady cam so that you can be walking along
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:04.100]   There's no footsteps. Nothing bounces up and down you can actually do smooth pans
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:08.100]   I was riding on the back of an elephant and it produced fantastically stable footage
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:12.980]   I was riding on the back of an elephant. Don't just him buy that there
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:16.740]   Yeah, well, I did that India trip with the with the algae friends
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:24.100]   One of the things was an Indian safari and of course you're bouncing up and down. Yeah with this on it's just absolutely fantastic
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:30.500]   It's just it's just it's not huge. Yeah, it's it's tiny and it's it's very portable very lightweight
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:35.300]   But you can you know no matter what motion you go you can actually stabilize it and it's sort of got three different
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:41.140]   Three different modes as well. So you can actually if I just hold down the button that you actually stay in perfect
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:46.340]   Location in 3d space. Oh, it's just it's just really a great gadget now. This is the g3
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:51.940]   They've actually come out with a g4 since uh, which has got these wires are hidden and you can also charge a go pro
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:57.540]   From the batteries built into the handset, but when was it nab last week? There's actually more coming out now
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:00.820]   You can actually get these now for smartphones. So there's a couple now
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:06.100]   Uh, I don't think they're on the market. Yeah, but I did see a couple of prototypes of these similar things that can just put an android
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:09.460]   Or an iPhone onto it and that turns your iPhone into a steady cam
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:12.580]   I bought a crazy
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:15.220]   crazy gimbal
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:16.820]   the nebula
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:18.580]   4000
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:22.580]   for my uh, sony a7 camera so for my s l r right yeah
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:27.860]   But I had it's a pain in the butt to use because you have to balance everything carefully before you can use it
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:34.020]   And I when we were out shooting our uh show open for the new screensavers launching me second on some of these same networks
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:41.460]   Um, we did a we we had the great freeman our shooter had a beautiful professional kind of steady cam gimbal system
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:45.060]   This is a very popular system now, but he also he would spend you know
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:49.460]   He had a special person to balance the gimbal. Do you have to balance your gimbal?
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:53.780]   No, not this particular one because it is actually designed for the go pro if I actually just switch it off
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:56.020]   It's it sort of just goes limp when you switch it off
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:58.580]   And then you just switch it on so basically
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:01.780]   Uh, it goes into a rucksack if I wanted to use it. I just pull out my rucksacks
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:06.740]   Button on the bottom. You just press the button and then within a few seconds it snaps into action
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:12.500]   And you're ready to go. There's a lot less money than my nebula 4000. I gotta tell you action. Well, imagine
[01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:16.500]   Yeah, 250 bucks us for that right. Okay. Yeah, a bit more expensive here in the UK
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:19.780]   And I have I actually bought exactly the same one
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:21.700]   You like that one
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:22.900]   Approved
[01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:26.740]   So yeah, I very much approve it. It is it is it is an amazing little bit
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:28.900]   I I shot a shot of my kids running
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:34.900]   Across the back of our yard and I'm running full tilt behind them with that go pro
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:39.780]   And it's just like we're floating. This is like i'm floating behind them. It was just it was quite amazing
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:41.940]   You know, um, there's just no vibration. I
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:45.620]   Uh, it was it was quite a quite an experience for me to experiment with
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:49.060]   I want one for my smartphone because it would double as a selfie stick
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:52.180]   Right
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.860]   So
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:55.860]   Do you say they make one or they're going to make one?
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:58.100]   No, there there are some uh,
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:01.620]   3d not the same company the river blood different japanese and chinese companies
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:05.940]   NAB but there are some with uh, with just a smartphone holder
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:10.260]   Yeah, I think you do have to balance that to set it up. Yeah, this particular one is look at this nebula fourth
[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:18.100]   Other thing it takes me an hour. I want to recommend it, but I just I have to get good at balancing the dang thing. All right, it's crazy
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:23.140]   Crazy and it's also like 800 bucks crazy
[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:27.540]   So what do you do, Alex? Do you mean you guys probably have a real steady cam?
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:31.460]   We have a couple different things so we have we have a steady cam
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:37.220]   And my my brother joe is now a steady cam operator. So is this the same technology gimbal technology or is it different?
[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:44.100]   Well, no, so so steady cam is doesn't have any of this any of the gimbal stuff, but you can add them together
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:48.820]   So for instance, I have a Ronin. It's probably what your dp was using for the thing
[01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:52.580]   And so it's a Ronin's got two handles. Yeah, put a red or a big camera. That's it
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:58.580]   Yeah, and so and what that is is that a lot of this all this gimbal technology really came from uh drones because
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:03.860]   All the drones they were building all these gimbal systems for the cameras and then they realized, you know, it would be really good if we just held
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:08.260]   Onto these, you know, and so well, that's effective makes the Ronin and his DJI the right right
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:15.060]   Yeah, so I have the so I have a Ronin with a red camera that that that I use then I have the the little one for the go pro
[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:18.900]   Um those are great for getting new smooth shots
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:23.540]   You don't have you have some control, but you don't have the artistic control that you'd have with a steady cam
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:26.100]   Which is a much more manual process. It's balancing the camera
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:30.980]   But it's really like how it turns and everything else it steadies it, but you really have control
[01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:34.500]   So if you're doing a really like a film level control shot
[01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:38.980]   One of these does not in my opinion replace a good steady cam operator
[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:43.780]   But most of us are bad steady cam operators and so as a result, this is really good for that
[01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:49.540]   Up to about 80 of what you would use a steady cam for these will do that once you
[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:52.500]   Get over that you really need someone who's got years of experience
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.580]   You're what you what you have passed
[01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:58.660]   I mean we did our first shows we bought the steady cam took a lesson and we're shooting with it
[01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:01.780]   You know and and it this would have been better
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:05.860]   You know like this would have been a better solution for us for the kind of shots we were doing
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:08.900]   Um so but so if you want to have that that artistic control
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:11.940]   You need to have a lot of experience or hire someone with a lot of experience
[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:17.300]   If you want just steady shots of your kids if you want steady shots for your short film
[02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:18.660]   Um
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:20.660]   Walking behind people
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:23.940]   Those are all things that are great. You can again also add these together
[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:25.940]   Some people are adding these gimbals to the steady cam
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:30.340]   So you have some of the control and then there's ultra, you know, that's an entirely different feel
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:33.540]   So um, there's and there's a lot of interesting creative things you can do
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:38.820]   Because these are so stabilized you can literally have one person hand the rig to another person
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:41.620]   So you could have you could following someone they get into a car
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:46.100]   You can the rig to the person in the car and it follows along with them all in one single shot
[02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:48.660]   Not if not if what you did was what greg did
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:55.380]   Well, he has this thing which goes straps onto his waist and has a string that can you see my screen that comes over the top
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:57.940]   And holds the road
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:00.740]   And a lot of ways that's a stress reliever
[02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:04.100]   Right, it's just because he's that's a long time has got to hold that thing
[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:10.180]   So this helps him hold it. Yeah, exactly a lot of those those kinds of rigs do give it a little bit more
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:14.980]   Um a little more control, but also uh those things these rigs get really heavy
[02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:19.460]   Um, you know, I know that my brothers can get up to you know, 78 years of gear
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:23.540]   We used a steady cam uh up in Canada for the lab with leah as you know
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:28.180]   And uh the operator man the guy was wearing it for four hours at a time and man
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.180]   That must have been just
[02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:31.780]   Exhausting it's a process
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:33.940]   And they really have to pace themselves where they're shooting
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:36.580]   And then you set it down for a minute or you throw it over your back
[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:41.220]   But you'll see that the good ones will get very good at how they manage their time because you really can only go
[02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:45.380]   Most of them can only go 15 or 20 minutes at that very outer edge
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:49.220]   Really only creatively for the first five or 10 minutes, but this is kind of cool
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:54.100]   I like I like the run and that's pretty pretty amazing. I didn't really DJ DJ I made him
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:59.780]   Yeah, well again, they're taking a technology that was working for their drones and just applied
[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:03.220]   Or something out of me of course the drone technology is basically uh
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:05.860]   Specialization of the segue technology
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:08.820]   So it was kind of appropriate
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:14.020]   That we use the run and camera to shoot the uh screen savers open in which we are
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:16.500]   riding
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.340]   segways
[02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:23.700]   By the way, we decided to buy two of these alex the next time you're uh, you're around. I want to get you in a segue
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:28.580]   I so want great shooting this when we come down you'll see it most when we come down
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:31.060]   Lombard Street the crookus street in the world
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:38.340]   Uh, he's standing there with the Ronan on and is he's using the cannon cinema cameras those great cameras
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:40.660]   Yeah
[02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:41.700]   Yeah
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:45.940]   Really really there we go. See yeah, see he's on and it's pretty amazing
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:48.740]   Pretty amazing
[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:50.820]   You're gonna be part of this right alex you have to come back
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:53.780]   Yes, wouldn't be the screen savers without you
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:55.780]   I would I can't wait
[02:02:55.780 --> 02:03:01.860]   You can ride my segue
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:09.220]   May 2nd we're doing them saturday afternoon 3 p.m. Pacific six p.m. Eastern time
[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:15.300]   And that's uh the new screen savers with many of the old screen savers part of in fact our first show will uh feature uh
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:18.260]   Patrick Norton as my uh co-host
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:22.180]   So alex what do you got for us?
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:30.580]   So, um, I have a a long time pixx member and a friend and just a really talented teacher. Um, tony farley is uh
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:36.420]   Uh, he put out a book and I just love every once in a while. I see a good eye, you know someone starting to use
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:40.420]   Uh, you know, I books, you know and expanding on it and so on and so forth
[02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:42.500]   And so he has a book called arduino
[02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:51.540]   Programming circuits and physics love it and and and so basically if you want to learn how to how to you know start working with an arduino
[02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:55.060]   It really starts with plug the you know plug the usb in
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:04:02.420]   Um and really how to get started on pushing programs to the arduino circuits and then you know, it's and what's interesting about it
[02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:07.620]   Is it's not just a how to you know, like for instance he gets into voltage and there's there's an led
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:12.420]   But he gets into voltage and there's animations and they're talking about is this it tony farley? Yeah, that's it
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:14.100]   awesome
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:16.980]   And and he's got 3d rendering that he did
[02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:20.900]   And uh or or some of his students he teaches at san lehandra high school
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:25.860]   And um just a really really talented educator and it's it's 99 cents
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:26.820]   Oh man
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:31.940]   That it's 99 cents with video and and then he's already said at the beginning that he's gonna keep on updating it
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:33.780]   So it's just you know, it's kind of like this living
[02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:39.220]   You know, uh book that he's gonna keep on adding so if you have and that's the great thing about i books
[02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:42.980]   Uh in the way it's set up as he can just update it and and uh, you know
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:45.860]   He said he's gonna update it for free and just keep on kind of jumping into it
[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:48.980]   But but there's a lot of you know, the the substrate clear
[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:52.260]   There's a little step-by-step. You'll see some of those being like one two three with little
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:57.620]   Examples there's videos in it. It's it's an amazing value for 99 cents
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:05:00.740]   So uh and and really just a great book either way
[02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:06.180]   I have a couple of Arduino books because i've been playing with it and and this is one of the clearest ones that i've seen
[02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:08.500]   Would this be appropriate for home use?
[02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:09.380]   Uh
[02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:10.180]   Oh, yeah, yeah
[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:12.100]   It's it's designed for both teachers
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:16.660]   I mean because there's workbooks and there's little things at the end that you can go through to make sure you understand it
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:22.340]   Uh, but you could definitely use this if you wanted to get started with, uh, you know working with our do we know?
[02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:27.300]   Um and so and if you had a kid who was uh so inclined
[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:31.380]   Uh, what a great way to do some hands-on stuff
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:36.020]   Well, i've been kind of hacking around with it and what i what i actually want to do is do it with my my kids
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:38.420]   You know and so we kind of go through each one of these very
[02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:42.340]   Stematically and talk about talk about the stuff so they can kind of get their head around it
[02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:46.500]   i've been you know, of course playing with the the um little bits and and
[02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:49.860]   Mine storms, but but i think it's time to start, you know, really
[02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:56.020]   Playing with something a little more serious and so um so anyway, so i think that it's a it's a great little book and it's definitely worth
[02:05:56.020 --> 02:05:57.700]   uh
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:06:04.420]   Supporting him and also and also getting to uh, you know getting started with our do you know if it's something you've been trying to figure out
[02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:07.380]   How you're gonna get started it's 55 bucks for the ultimate
[02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:10.740]   On on amazon so if you want to learn how to do this
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:14.660]   It's costs nothing and then you get this book for 99 cents and start wiring away
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:19.940]   And you can be the geek that you always wanted to be physics i book dot com is tony Farley's site
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:23.780]   And i'll give you links so you can buy this it's on the i bookstore only 99 cents
[02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:27.380]   Tony Farley our jouino programming circuits and physics
[02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:31.460]   at physics i book dot com
[02:06:32.260 --> 02:06:36.260]   And he's got other books up there too and yeah, yeah, he's prolific. Uh, i book
[02:06:36.260 --> 02:06:41.860]   Yeah, librarian yeah, and it's all about physics and stuff which is hey who who doesn't love that
[02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:48.260]   Exactly. I should have put this on an ipad to show you this is a game that i i don't know how i found it
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:51.300]   But now that i found it i can't stop playing it's called hook
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:55.620]   And it's a puzzle game i phone or ipad
[02:06:55.620 --> 02:07:01.060]   Um, and it it starts out very simple if you played black remember how much we loved black
[02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:07.780]   This is like a let me turn it up. I know you know, he says where headphones. It's really it's you know, the sounds not that important
[02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:12.180]   It's one of those games where there's no explanation at all you just kind of learn by doing
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:16.340]   And it's a first very simple you're solving puzzles
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:19.140]   There's certain rules you will learn
[02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:24.980]   And uh as you solve it, but it gets deeper and deeper and deeper the idea is to clear the screen
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:27.700]   By pressing the buttons
[02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:31.380]   And if stuff is intertwined, you know, for instance if i press this button
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:34.980]   It won't be able to draw the line because this one's in the way
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:37.540]   And it'll say nope got to start over
[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:41.620]   Which by the way, if you've done a lot of clearing and then the later levels you will have
[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:44.900]   Starting over is a punishment
[02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:50.500]   It's a it. Oh see kit wrong button wrong button got to press this button and that button
[02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:54.580]   This looks really easy doesn't it get to level 40 then tell me how easy it is
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:08:01.060]   And it won't take you too long to get to level 40. This is just basically tutorial levels. It is uh, I think it's a buck
[02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:06.500]   It's not expensive and it is totally addictive. I showed Lisa last night
[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:12.420]   And uh, she she literally went to 40 or 42 stayed up way late
[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:16.180]   It's one of those games you play and you go i'm gonna stay up late and solve this one
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:18.660]   It's a lot of fun hook
[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:20.820]   Just you know a little everybody should have a little there you go
[02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:23.380]   How much is it?
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:27.700]   No, no, just a little puzzle everybody should have a little puzzle game. It's kind of good soundtrack
[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:31.060]   You can almost do this
[02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:32.580]   um
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:34.580]   And i'm watch
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:42.980]   Uh, ladies gentlemen, that concludes this edition of mac abraik weekly. Thank you don mccallister great to see you my friend
