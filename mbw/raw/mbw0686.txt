[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.280]   But we have so much to talk about with apples, earnings, Lori dives deep into that.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.920]   We talk a little bit about the housing crisis and how Apple may or may not be helping with that,

[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.960]   I don't know why I wanted to go that long with it, but I decided to. I am Mike Asargent Leo
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.000]   Leport is on vacation right now. He will be back soon. Don't you worry. But until that time,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.080]   I am here and I am excited to introduce the managing editor of iMore.com. It's
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.920]   Lori Gill. Hello, Lori Gill. Hi, how are you? I'm doing well. How is your arm? It is
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.840]   bee stingless, I hope. Yes, I did manage. I just was saying I got coffee all over my
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.600]   MacBook Pro keyboard that I've had for three years in pristine condition. And I had a bee
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.160]   landed on my arm inside my house, by the way. And I instinctively shook my arm that was holding
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.120]   my coffee cup and it just splattered everything all over my MacBook Pro keyboard. The keyboard,
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.440]   or the MacBook Pro right now, is working, but a lot of coffee got into that keyboard, so we'll see
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.680]   how that goes. When you took up that beekeeping hobby, I really thought you meant like in your
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.280]   backyard. I don't know why you're doing that in your house. So basically those butterfly switches
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.800]   are really jittery right now. So there's some really freaked out butterflies. Those are bee
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.240]   switches at this point. That voice you just heard is WGBH is Andy Anotko or just Andy Anotko's Andy
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.680]   Anotko. How are you doing Andy? I'm doing just fine. It's like we're getting used to like rain
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.800]   and terrible stuff here in New England. But again, knowing where knowing that you're broadcasting
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.200]   from the West Coast, I'm not complaining at all. Hey, who knows to you for putting your own stamp
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.320]   or stamparoni on the old podcast there? It's great. That's why we get new blood because that's how,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.760]   if I'm not mistaken, this is also the part of the plot of the morning show, the new Apple TV Plus,
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.800]   where we've got new blood comes in and she starts to put her own stamp on the show and the car
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.920]   and host starts to feel a little bit threatened. I'd pay five bucks a month to see like you and Leo
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.560]   go at it. Oh, you know, that's what iOS today is. That's why it takes so long and you're usually
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.280]   waiting for him to come to Macbreak Weekly is because we have our little cage match after every
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.600]   episode. Joining us also from Andy Anotko's undisclosed location, who was here with me last week,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.640]   it is Alex Lindsey of Pixel Coin. Hello, Alex Lindsey. I just appear and disappear all over the world.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:19.520]   It's a complicated process. Yeah, but we're glad you're here. You're back and we are excited for
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.520]   the show today. Renee Richie is not joining us, but we love him and we will see him soon.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.080]   Until that time though, we'll need somebody here to make obscure references to movies and gangster
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.120]   rap. So I don't know which one of you wants to take that up, but we can figure that out as we go
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.120]   along. When you throw it out there that we love him, it's almost as though like he went out for
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.200]   cigarettes and he hasn't been back in three days. We love you. Renee come back. We love you.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.520]   He went out for AirPods Pro and a pack of AirPods Pro and he's just not in back sense.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.320]   Lori Gill, did you do the earnings transcript for Apple's earnings report?
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.400]   I did. Thank you for your instructions so long ago in teaching me how to do it. I was able to
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.160]   get the transcript. It's transcriptions up and yes. Beautiful. Of course, an original shout out to
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.640]   both Serenity Caldwell and Jason Snell. They also went out for AirPods Pro and haven't been back
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:28.320]   in a while, but we think what's happening. What's going on? What's going on? We thank them for their
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:36.320]   help in that as well and learning how to do these transcript calls right. But we've got 64 billion
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.680]   dollars in revenue. By golly, Apple saying services, services, services, services, over and over again
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:52.400]   in earnings reports, clearly there's something to that because 20% of said revenue was to services.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.720]   Someone want to explain to all of us what is included in services?
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.320]   It's such a weird, weird forago. Yes, you would think that it includes things like iTunes and
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.280]   it does. Yes, you would think it turns its iCloud and it does. But it also includes things like the
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.720]   what billion, 1. something billion dollars that Google pays Apple for the benefit of having
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.960]   Google as the primary search engine. So it's a really, as Pi goes, it's a really complicated
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.120]   slice. It's not like wearables. It's not like Mac. It really is anything else that we can say that
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.960]   we don't actually that's made out of electrons or riffled us as opposed to molecules becomes
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.640]   services. So quite a bit of stuff. I mean, yes, it's not iPhone and it's not those things. But
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.320]   we've got Apple just now launching TV plus. We've got Apple Arcade. We've got all these different
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.520]   subscription services there. iCloud storage solutions. And so there are quite a few
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.200]   regular recurring money services that they provide. And then of course, all the money they
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:04.640]   make off of Apple Pay given that Apple's Apple Pay has become the highest. I can't remember exactly
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.720]   what the precise rating is. But essentially, it's beat out Starbucks now as the highest rated
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.800]   tap to pay service. So it makes sense that Apple's the most used tap to pay service.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.600]   Yeah. There you go. The most used tap to pay service. Thank you, Carsten. And so it makes
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.280]   sense that they've got a lot of revenue coming from there. And to me, it seems as they've put
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.520]   the writing on the wall through these different, I mean, back when I was transcribing the calls,
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.760]   they were saying services over and over again. As Lori has taken over that, they continue to say
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.800]   it. And so they've been putting their money, their mouth where their money is, I guess,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.920]   in trying to make sure that services does get to be a big wedge of the pie.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:53.280]   Yeah. It's also a good response to stockholders that are saying, well, you had your big hit with
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.080]   iPhone, but now people are people. You sold iPhones. Everybody who's about to buy one,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.320]   where you're going to make your money from next, ignoring the Apple Watch, ignoring everything else.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.760]   And it really is given how much given that Google makes a lot of money on things they don't actually
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.880]   have to manufacture. Did it for Facebook, did it for everyone who gets subpoena alongside Apple in
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.160]   the anti trust conversations that happen in Congress these days. It's really great to be able to develop
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.120]   a piece of software that generates your money or generate the right contracts for services and
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.280]   for content that generate your money, as opposed to having to have these one and two year old,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.600]   two to five year old lead times and just guess that you're making the right piece of hardware.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.360]   Well, and also it's a very durable income. People tend to move off of subscription services very
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.120]   slowly. So much, you don't have to worry about whether your next iPhone is a hit if you're able
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.520]   to make that work. And it doesn't have to be the whole basket of revenue. It's just the bigger it
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:56.240]   becomes, the more that Apple has this kind of base that is just going to keep on generating revenue.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.440]   Yeah, it's as opposed to coming up with $800 to buy a new iPhone versus you signed up for the 30
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.960]   day free trial of something. And then maybe you don't love it, but you don't hate it enough to
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.240]   like say, please stop charging me $9. And a lot of the payment plans, I mean, it seems pretty clear
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.160]   Apple was kind of moving towards a payment, like our phone becomes a subscription service. And
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.520]   you know, when they convert that to subscription, then that piece of the pie gets really big.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.640]   So anyway, it seems like moving everything towards kind of a payment where you just keep
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.440]   get to have whatever the newest version is would make a lot of sense.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.280]   Now, is that something that we as this just is this something that has been rumored?
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.000]   Is this something that we could very well see happening? Because I did see some conversations
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.720]   about, yeah, the iPhone sort of going, I mean, it already is with the Apple upgrade program,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.600]   a bit of a subscription plan in a way. But if I could get the latest AirPods Pro, although I will
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.720]   come back, don't you worry, on a subscription plan, I think that would be kind of nice. I could see
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.600]   some logic there, the Apple Watch too. That's one of the big things with the Apple Watch people
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.360]   kind of gripe about, Oh, I've got to upgrade this thing again. I just did it last year. It's
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.640]   supposed to seems like it should last longer than that. Well, if you're complaining that,
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.840]   Oh God, I bought an Apple, I bought a three, four, $500 watch last year, and I'm gonna have to buy
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.920]   another, no, you don't. This is true. Your health your health your health plan will still be in
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.160]   effect. If you get sick, they will still treat you under your insurance plan, or rather, they
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.480]   will probably deny your coverage. But it won't be because they won't, the first question will not be,
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:41.520]   did you buy a new iPhone this year? So it's, I mean, I'm probably going to be replacing my pixel one
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:49.120]   sometime soon, particularly because the Google finally cut the phone off from security updates.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.600]   But the thing is, I, year after year after year, I couldn't find a really good reason to replace
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.080]   it. These things, they last a long time, they work really well. And unless they're going to give you
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.560]   a feature that you unless they're going to solve a problem for you, or there's a new feature that
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.680]   will create a new opportunity for you, don't it's on, it's on you, if you feel a pressure to upgrade
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.920]   a device and still working perfectly fine. Yeah, I didn't feel the need to get a new watch,
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.360]   as a good example, because the major features that were there, I was kind of like that, I don't
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.560]   really care. So, so, you know, I think that, you know, that's a good example. And I, but I do think that
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.880]   if you got to a point where there was a subscription plan that you can kind of decide what hardware
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.280]   comes with that subscription plan, I think a lot of people would over time, you know, just make a
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.280]   payment, whether it's $40 a month or $60 a month or whatever it is. You know, I think that there's
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.560]   a lot of people that would just prefer to make a monthly payment and then I would think about it,
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.760]   just get the new thing rather than having to come up with that, with that big chunk.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.440]   But then to we, is Apple like liable for, morally liable for all the e-ways that goes into the
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.200]   system that now people are consuming new phones every single year, they have little machines that
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.680]   are taking the thing apart and then and then and then grabbing the things they had all, there's a
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.000]   video is really good about that. They could be creating jobs, jobs, have real people,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.680]   pick new, let's have, let's automate it, we'll have the robots do it, we don't have to pay them,
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.040]   we don't have to kick together, help. I don't know. I think that that's part of the reason why
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.800]   they're bossing. Even when they're, they're putting all of their junk.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.920]   This is quickly becoming a skit. And without even giving us a chance to like get paid to sweep
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:27.760]   the bastards up. Now LG revolution revolution. Well, that goes on. Yeah, well, that goes on over
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:35.280]   there. I have to ask you, Lori, you moved off of some of the services, correct? Like you, you stopped,
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.840]   you're not doing Apple Arcade right now. I canceled Apple Arcade, but not because I don't love it.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.720]   Let me make sure that everyone's clear with that. I actually really enjoy it. But I do have a problem
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.640]   with video game consumption and the amount of time I have to consume video games. And right now,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.800]   I'm hyper focused on games on Nintendo Switch. So I will go back to it probably in January or
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.560]   February, maybe, but for now it's just on, it's temporarily canceled just because I don't,
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.440]   I don't want to be spending money on, I'm not, I'm not playing the games. I'm playing my console
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.760]   games. So until I'm done playing my console games, I don't want to be spending the money for it
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.720]   every month. But I'm sure that I'm going to reinstate that in a few months. But other than that,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.640]   I have all the services. So Lori, you have a monotheistic religious relationship with games.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:30.160]   Yes. Right. You pray to one God at once. Yes. One gaming God. Yes. But I do have, I subscribe to
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.280]   News Plus, which I absolutely love. I love the magazines in News Plus. And you can come at me.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.920]   I really think it's great. I love magazines. So it's a really great service for me.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:46.320]   And Apple Plus, Apple TV Plus, I'm on that service now, of course, for a year for free. But,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.360]   you know, we'll see. Maybe I'll keep it once, once a year is up. I started watching a couple
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.760]   shows and I was into them. I like them. They're not, they're not great, but they're good.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.480]   Oh, they're not great, but they're good. Well, we hear this term subscription fatigue.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:09.280]   And I'm curious, you know, if Apple is making a piece of its pie in a pretty good sizable chunk
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:17.920]   of its pie in services, there companies handle that subscription fatigue thing in different ways.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.200]   And one of the ways that Apple seems to be doing it is like with Apple TV Plus program,
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:27.440]   you can get it a year for free when you buy a new Apple product within certain
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:35.600]   devices. It also is bundled with the Apple music student subscription. So you pay that one
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.400]   subscription, you get music and you get Apple TV Plus. When it comes to Apple Arcade, there was,
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.480]   what is a month free. And so different companies out there kind of handling it by giving you a
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.760]   taste to see if it's something that you want to stick with and then you choose to go afterward.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:59.360]   But there are some services like Apple's storage solution that is a little bit more,
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:08.400]   I find that one to be a harder sell. When I'm talking to my family, my sister has a bajillion
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:16.000]   D photos on her phone and she only has the free storage plan. And I say, well, if you pay just,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.240]   you know, a couple bucks a month, you'll have all this iCloud storage. And then those photos
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.360]   that you want to keep will be up there. And then you don't have to worry about the me on your
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.600]   local device. That is the hardest sell, no matter who I'm talking to. I can't convince anyone,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:38.560]   it seems to pay for a monthly storage solution. Meanwhile, I'm over here with Dropbox and iCloud
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.920]   storage and I probably pay for singing Amazon storage. I don't even know. Well, it was part of Amazon
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:53.440]   Prime. And I wonder about sort of where Apple is really focusing the attention of its services
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:59.200]   business in order to make sure that people do like Alex was saying, you know, get into it and then
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   they're there. It's frictionless enough that they don't really feel the need to step away from it.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.040]   It feels a little bit more secure. And the storage thing could be fixed in some ways by
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.880]   giving people three months of it for free. Because once you got once you started having all of your
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:17.520]   photos, that's that whole, you know, like, well, that's just mean. That's like,
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.960]   Tex, oh, what was it? It was Texan or whatever, you know, the Saturday Night Live thing where they,
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.200]   you know, they have a little girl in a bed, Texan pays for my my whole insurance. It's like
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.960]   Texan, do what we say and no one gets hurt. So once they get all your photos up there, I mean,
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.280]   like, for instance, Dropbox, I have I have terabytes on Dropbox and I'm trying to get rid of it.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:43.840]   Like, I'm trying to get rid of Dropbox to or to at least lower it. And it's so hard to get it off,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.320]   you know, like when you have terabytes, you know, it doesn't just easily, you know, it's so hard to
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:54.160]   download it. It's very buggy. So it's like this constant challenge to get to get off of it. And
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.120]   so I think that that's the problem with the storage is people just haven't done it. I mean,
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.520]   I have the storage because it means that seamlessly all of my stuff is uploaded. You know, my photos
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.480]   are all up there and I lose a phone. I'm like, you know, it's it's there, you know, within with,
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:12.240]   you know, very quickly within a day or two, it was. Yeah, it's really easy to make money off of
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:19.360]   storage because I really I don't think I've ever even really done the math on how much I'm spending
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:25.600]   on various different sources of online storage because Google Photos does a really good job for
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.000]   my pictures, even the pictures I'm taking on an iPhone, whereas iCloud Storage does a really good
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   job with like I work stuff. So I'm paying a little bit of and for system backups,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.600]   I use Dropbox for your basic I want one folder of stuff that I can access no matter where I want to
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:46.240]   go. But I also have like a cloud backup solution because that's the most transparent way to simply
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.360]   say you see this this NASA server, I want this completely backed up some place that if this place
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.720]   catches on fire, the fire will probably not reach all the way to North Carolina where my my fire
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.760]   with it. And as someone who who lives in Northern California most of the time,
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.600]   that did not mean to. But but but but thinking about what your where your stuff is is important.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.840]   Alex did reflect upon the fact that it is actually raining like really. I was like, oh, wait,
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.200]   let's let's get an umbrella like over the road. Like I'm going to join the rain.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:22.160]   Join it. Yeah, I miss I miss rain. It's coming. Don't worry. And when it when it shows up,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:29.040]   it will be nonstop for I heard it's very cold for about a day. It's chilling to the bone.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:37.200]   Well, you know, I the storage thing going back to you know, which talking about Dropbox there,
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:44.080]   it does feel a little bit at times like they purposely make it a buggy system to make it
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.800]   difficult for you to get out of there. But I yeah, there's there's some. There is a small part of
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.680]   me that does wish that they did offer a 30 month thing because then I could show my sister, for
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.160]   example, see, this is how it works. And this is how easy it is. And then suddenly that that
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.720]   three ninety nine or whatever it is was a two ninety nine two ninety nine for two hundred gigs.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.840]   And that that includes the family sharing of it. So then it immediately becomes better for everyone.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.600]   If you're paying three dollars a month for everyone in your family to share 200 gigs.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.840]   And it depending on how much storage you need, that's really not that much. And Mike, I think
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.200]   what you're talking about with people not wanting that service, it it partly is because you can
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.760]   find a lot of free ways to use online storage. So people feel maybe a little resentful that Apple
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:39.040]   isn't also offering a lot of it for free. But they're not there's all these things behind the
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.840]   screen that they're that aren't being considered in why Apple isn't offering more than five gigs
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.360]   for free. Honestly, I think they could probably up the amount that they offer for free to 10 or 15
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.080]   gigs. I think that would just be a nice thing to do, especially with iCloud phone backups.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:03.040]   They take two or three gigs just by themselves. So it's not tangible that you don't see the benefit
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:08.800]   of paying for three dollars a month for cloud service. So you don't want it. You don't want
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   to spend that extra money. You see the tangible benefits of five dollars a month for unlimited
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:21.520]   access to games or exclusive TV shows or something. You are like receiving the benefits of that
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:28.400]   visually. But iCloud backups, people probably just tend to think, well, I don't need it. I'm fine
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.280]   without it. And I'm not realizing that there's so many things they could benefit from being able
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.160]   to back up like photos specifically. If you're not backing up your photos somewhere and you lose
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.800]   them all, you're going to be scratching out your eyes wishing that you had spent three dollars a
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:49.280]   month for a backup service. But now it's too late. But you didn't think that at the time. You thought
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:56.000]   I'm fine. And then now that you don't have it, then you're wishing for it. So it's harder to explain
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.880]   that to people. The portability of being able to move all your files around all the time is
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:08.880]   addicting. I have this document. I have a folder on my iPad, my iPhone, my computers. It's called
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:14.560]   Transfer Docs inside my iCloud. And anything I need to keep that I need to be able to access
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.880]   from anything, I just throw that, throw files in there all the time. And then it's just the
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.320]   soup, I mean, I can air drop it or whatever. But it's just like this thing I'm working on,
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.000]   I put it in there, I put it in there, and it's just instantly everywhere. And you get used to that
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.640]   kind of interactivity and just beyond just the backup storage. And when I first started
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:40.160]   pushing towards the cloud, I wouldn't let keynote or pages or whatever save into the cloud. I was
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.400]   like, oh, this is going to be a pain. Now I'm like, why did I save that to the best app? You know,
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.040]   it has to be on the cloud. Because it's just like, oh, I can't figure out where that presentation is.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.720]   Oh, I know that in iCloud and keynote, it's going to be sitting there and I just go pull it down and
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.640]   I'm off to the races. So yeah, that the my Mac book is finally ready. I've sent it off for that
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.880]   screen repair. Like I said, a couple of weeks ago, it's ready. It's been ready for like a day or two,
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.960]   but I haven't been able to come up pick it up till then I'm using like this Windows laptop,
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.040]   because the only laptop I have that's like powerful enough to do Skype. And it's like,
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   I'm so like on edge because I don't have Dropbox set up to it. And it's going to be such a deal
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.720]   to make sure that all the work I've been doing on this machine gets put back into the centralized
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.240]   truth that I rely on for all my other machines. The centralized truth.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:34.560]   Let's let's go ahead and move on to the Apple has moved up some senior. What is it? Senior
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:40.080]   executives? I can't I can't remember what they were before. But senior directors, I think,
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:48.800]   is the term to VPs. So we've got five new VPs. We've got a VP of hardware engineering, a VP of
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:56.400]   software engineering, VP of acoustics, and a VP of marketing. So some of those, you just put people
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.800]   in those positions because those positions seem to be filled by find the VP of acoustics kind of
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.880]   cool. This this person, Gary Gives, I guess would be the way that that's pronounced. We'll go with
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.320]   that. Sorry, Gary, if I've mispronounced your name, but Gary Gives as the VP of acoustics,
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:21.680]   it was ran the audio technology department for AirPods and the HomePod. So with AirPods being
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.160]   out there, AirPods Pro now being out there, and whatever comes next for HomePod,
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:32.240]   it makes sense to sort of have somebody in this in this VP role as this continues to move along.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:41.360]   And then some folks like this Bloomberg article talks about Borchers being a big spokesperson
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:47.520]   for the iPhone when it first came out and even appeared in some videos explaining how to use
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:55.840]   the product. So, you know, I think sometimes we're looking for things to read between the lines with
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:02.320]   shakeups and move-ups within the company. And there were some folks who've been, you know,
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:08.800]   moved out of the company and these folks have moved in. But a VP is a pretty big position. And I think
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:16.400]   that I would argue that one thing it can show is if there's a VP role for a specific topic,
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.960]   then that's something that the company's paying close attention to. And so VP of acoustics
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.720]   with that role we've got people really feel on that.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:32.000]   It also plays a role in staff retention that if people have certain goals when it comes to their
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.120]   careers and they have vice presidential position on the org chart is sort of like an affirmation
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.880]   that what they're doing is being is they're responsible something really, really important.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.680]   We're not just, I'm not just an engineer who gets consulted every time that there's something
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.800]   that's supposed to make noise with an Apple logo on it. And also, obviously we're talking about
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.920]   AirPods and stuff like that. But let's not overlook the fact that, damn it, like the
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.440]   audio on an iPhone is amazing. The audio on Macbooks is amazing, which I mentioned again,
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:11.040]   I'm using it. And this is the Windows book I'm using is not a cheap one. This is a ThinkPad
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:18.240]   like X1 Carbon, which is probably positioned as the same sort of level as a MacBook and
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:24.160]   love a lot of things about it. But my goodness, it sounds like a speaker coming out from a laptop.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.040]   And I'm not used to my laptop speakers sounding like laptop speakers. I'm used to them sounding
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:35.120]   like really good little desktop speakers. So, yeah, it's one of those things that goes into
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.600]   every single thing that Apple does. It's not good enough to make a good enough. You have to really
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.040]   knock people back on their heels without good the audio is from this weird little thing.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.240]   I agree. I think that's something. I think that's something. I think that's something.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.600]   Or not fascinating, but taken aback by how well the audio sounds coming out of whatever Apple
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:59.120]   device I am using. And I can't remember who we're talking to somebody about listening to audio
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.800]   through an iPhone. And I think it was actually, I think it was my pal Ant Pruitt. So let me call
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.560]   him out here for a second. And he was sort of taken aback by the idea that people are listening
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.320]   through their phones or that like maybe that we expected more from that experience. But
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.360]   I don't need to really expect more from that experience because it's pretty good for what it
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.880]   is. And I'm always impressed with that. Now, Laurie, you were about to say something.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:29.520]   That we, as Apple users, where everything we own is in the Apple ecosystem, we tend to forget
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.640]   that there's other systems out there that maybe don't have as good quality of audio. So,
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.120]   we just take for granted that it's good. And just assume everything else is supposed to be as good
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.160]   as that until we try those other things and realize, "Oh, well, the speakers on this monitor
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.560]   are terrible compared to the speakers on my MacBook Pro. What is that about?" What's that
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.800]   rattling in that echo? What's going on? Why does it sound like a tin can?
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:27:00.160]   Yeah, I guess that's paying attention to all the details, which is part of the reason that we
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.200]   spend probably too much money on all these devices. Let's move on to something that's
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:13.520]   rather, how do I put it, controversial, as it were. Apple has said that they are committing
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:23.440]   $2.5 billion to combat the housing crisis in California. This, of course, is a long and
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:31.280]   a long and studied history of issues with the housing crisis in California. And Apple says,
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:38.640]   "Look, we've got a $2.5 billion plan that's going to help with housing availability and affordability.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:46.720]   Folks on either side, there are folks who are celebrating this idea. This is great. Apple is
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   paying attention and wants to help out." And then there are folks who say, "Well, if Apple paid all
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:58.000]   the taxes that they are technically due, then the government would be able to use that money to
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.040]   help with the... And we just want to make sure that Apple does pay all the taxes that are technically
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:10.000]   due. If Apple paid the taxes that they wanted to create so that Apple would have to pay more,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.960]   then Apple wouldn't be paying the taxes that they actually do. But this argument that they're not
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.360]   paying the taxes that they do, they are paying exactly what's... That's a really good point.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.400]   And our tax system is completely messed up.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.840]   They're paying exactly what's due in Ireland.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:31.440]   For sure. They're paid exactly what is currently due legally.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.480]   Correct. And all of us...
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.760]   Using every possible account they can.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:43.040]   Okay, I'm not saying that they shouldn't pay more taxes. If they make a law that hasn't
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:49.840]   paid more taxes, I'm fine with that. But this idea that we as individuals, I pay someone to
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.960]   manage my taxes. His job is to make sure that I pay as few taxes as possible, but do it legally.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.760]   I'm not trying to lift anything or turn anything inside out. I'm just like,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:05.120]   just manage it. And they'll be like, "Oh, well, this is what you're doing here and here."
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.720]   Now, I don't go any crazy structuring or anything else. But the point is, is that if,
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:16.000]   generally, as people have more resources, they tend to spend more of some fraction of those
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.800]   resources to make sure that they don't have to give up more than they have to.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.200]   And so what all these corporations are doing is what all of us do.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:30.160]   It's not a... To make it like, "Oh, it's a big corporation." If you were making that money,
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.600]   you'd figure that out too. There's no guarantee that sending it to the government is going to
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:40.640]   make it any better. But the difference is that I don't have either the money or the pull to
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:47.760]   hire legislators to create a tax system that benefits me so well. I would love to create a
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:54.080]   tax system in which people who are freelance journalists without children get negative taxes.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:30:01.520]   And again, if I could afford to put $40 million a year into lobbying at first, that's what I would
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.240]   do. So yeah, you are right. It's not as though they're cheating anybody out of what's doing
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:13.280]   something illegal, but they have access to the ability to not only legislate a beneficial position
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:19.040]   for themselves and for their industries and their income brackets, but also to... They can
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:24.720]   basically hire the sort of firepower that can actually prepare a document that is as complicated
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:31.760]   as the double Dutch window pane, doorknob, of a VISTAN bull, or whatever they're calling,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:38.880]   whatever the latest tax loophole trick is. So this is a great time for large corporations to be
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:46.160]   held accountable. I think that a lot of people who are not named Bernie are sort of realizing
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:55.440]   that, wait a minute, it's okay. Why are we basically saying, oh, isn't Apple really incredible for
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.480]   putting this to point, but isn't Google is wonderful for putting all this money into housing? They
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:06.240]   created that problem by driving prices. Sometimes I think that there's... And of course,
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.960]   the local government was also not solving the problem. And again, I'm not saying that they
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:17.440]   shouldn't pay more taxes. It's become a little bit of an irritant for me, because the thing is,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:24.960]   is that there's other things that... Okay, so I believe, and I may not be accurate, but I'm pretty
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.680]   sure that Apple is actually the largest tax, either the largest or one of the largest taxpayers
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:35.280]   in the country, possibly in the world. So when we say that they're not paying their fair share,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.200]   they are paying a lot of taxes. Now, those are sales taxes, those are payroll taxes.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.080]   So it's not... There is one... So out of all the taxes that are paid, there's this one sliver
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.440]   that they're not paying. They're paying all these other taxes and all these other municipalities,
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.280]   all of their employees are paying all these taxes and all these municipalities. There is an
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.800]   enormous amount of money being generated for those governments, whether it's through the
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.400]   employee taxes that are paid, through the payroll taxes that are paid, through the sales taxes that
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.520]   are paid. Those are all enormous amounts of money that are being spread out into the government.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.760]   So we focus on this one little section that they're not paying.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:17.360]   And that's the thing that... So it's a... I don't know what the percentage is, although I
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.400]   now am curious and I'll go find out. Maybe someone in the chat room will figure out what the percentage
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:29.440]   is. But the point is, is that there's already billions going out. And I've seen
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.240]   back and forths with large corporations in areas and the corporations then move out.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:43.360]   And they just moved to another location because the municipality made it so difficult for them to
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.120]   work because they wanted all the extra stuff from them. And they said, "Okay, now we're going to move."
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.600]   Like those poor LA raiders, they had the Cote de la Cote. No, I'm not going to get into it,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.080]   but a company I worked for that did that. But they moved. And in that location, it was...
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.000]   What they weren't really calculating was all of the business that was done by all those employees
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.960]   and all of the taxes that were done by those employees. And when that all left,
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:14.800]   that location sucked in. And so I think we need to look at the benefit that...
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:22.320]   It's easy. It's a good politics to talk about corporate taxes. But it's not taking into account
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:27.040]   the overall benefit. As we start to attack, I mean, the thing that I get concerned about is when we
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:34.000]   start to attack American companies that have gotten really big, we can look at things like TikTok,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.920]   which is not an American company, not going to be bought by American company,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:45.920]   and is growing in the interest level that we have. And I think that we just need to be careful of
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:51.360]   breaking up all these companies or pressing down on them really hard because we are in a...
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.200]   As Americans, we are in a beneficial position at the moment that may not last forever.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:05.600]   But we can't overstate how important this crisis is. Because I really do think that in
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:13.200]   the Bay Area, you're creating a situation of housing shortages and housing
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.840]   unavailability that causes an entire... It's probably a different...
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.280]   It's probably a different... It's probably a whole different podcast.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.440]   Well, okay. No, no, no. Yeah.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.400]   I'm happy to keep talking about it. I'm just letting...
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   Okay, you can't... No, no, I...
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.520]   The free Schwepp said... Oh, yeah. You're out now.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.040]   No, no, no. Let's take it very much.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.520]   All I was going to say is that I hope I'm not distracting from the big conversation where,
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.840]   when you get into a situation where school teachers can't afford to live anywhere near the
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.440]   communities of the children they're served, when first responders can't afford to live
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.120]   anywhere near the communities they respond to. Again, people who provide important daily services
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.120]   to the community, they can't afford to live in the communities they serve.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:03.360]   That's what causes whatever unique social civilization you have in that area to suddenly
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.120]   dissolve because it just don't work anymore. And so that's why we need... We're grateful for
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.600]   any solution that people come up with. We aren't grateful though.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.960]   I've been north of California and I see these people argue...
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.480]   I'm a big ball of gratitude. If I want to pull a shack
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:25.360]   behind my house, it's going to cost me $50,000 in licensing with the city to do that.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:31.040]   And the thing is, is that that... And I have neighbors who don't want anything to change
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.840]   because they don't want to increase the density of where we live.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.560]   And so you have a lot of... It's not just the corporations that are adding more people.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.000]   We have to understand that the building rules and local government as well as...
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.560]   Local government, rent control as popular as it is, is proven to be something that
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:56.400]   depresses investment in real estate. And so rent control, building codes that require
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:03.360]   incredible somersaults to produce in addition to the fact that there's a strong demand of people
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:09.520]   that want to live there. At the same time, you have to have enough regulation that can
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.480]   compete with these wonderful disruptions that people are trying to create.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:20.320]   If I were to buy this building and decided that I'm going to rent out the...
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.880]   I really believe that there should be more apartments for people who are creative people,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.800]   people who are self-employed. I would spend so much money on developing that lease to make sure
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.480]   that you cannot Airbnb anything for any reason. And if someone... If my town is going to be
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.760]   erecting affordable housing, I'm not going to have these units being bought up by people with this,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.920]   who they're going to turn into their own little hotels. You have to make sure that the people...
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.280]   This is for people who make families that have children and who collectively make less than
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.120]   $50,000 a year. You have to make sure that these are going to those places. So you have to have
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:00.080]   certain regulation. These companies don't want to... Regardless of what they say, they don't want
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.520]   to stay in the Bay Area. They're just there because they can't figure it out. They can't figure out
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.280]   how to get the engines on the spaceship. But you... No, no, no, no. Just how to move out of the...
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.120]   How to move out of... I don't sell it on Valley. I mean, you look at the experiments that they're doing
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:18.960]   in other parts of the country and other parts of the world. They are... There has been a word
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:25.440]   bandied about called terraforming, which is that is they want to get out. They want clean slates.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.720]   No, I don't know if Apple wants that. But I can tell you that other companies want clean slates.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.680]   They want to figure out how to move large portions of the... Or at least not keep on expanding where...
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:42.240]   Silicon Valley has this issue right now. Is it going to be an issue forever? Probably not.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:50.480]   There's billions of dollars being spent right now trying to figure out how to build something
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:56.720]   from scratch. And because the cities are completely... Part of the problem is the cities themselves
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:02.080]   is that you can't modernize them. You can't increase density. The density coefficient,
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:09.520]   when cut up into little squares that make it available for cars, makes the cities a disaster.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:15.600]   We need to think about cities that don't have any cars so that you can design things around
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:23.200]   very high density and that are information age, cities that allow that. And that's going to help
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:29.680]   change a lot of those things. But you can't really fix the cities that are here now. Sorry.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.320]   They're cute, but they're never going to work. If you get rid of the humans first, starting with
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.600]   the American... You get rid of the cars first. Okay, so cars go first. You can't... You can no longer
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:45.040]   drive a car on Market Street in San Francisco. This is true. So, the governments are trying.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.960]   Well, but then the first step is getting rid of the cars. The second step is building over the
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:53.360]   streets. Is building over the humans? Oh, no, not over the humans. No, not over the humans.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:39:00.720]   Humans are fine, but you need to give them more places to go. You know, 70% of LA is cars.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.840]   Like literally 70% of all of the square footage in LA is dedicated to cars.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:12.560]   I just saw a video last night. I think it was an ABC news video. Oh, goodness. Let's see if I can
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:20.720]   find it. And we'll see if I can actually play it, but I hope so. LA Street car. And it was this...
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.320]   It's hilarious. Well, it wasn't hilarious, but it was funny watching this music is playing in
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:34.960]   the background, and it's all mystical and sort of sweet. And it's just them zooming out on LA and
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.000]   showing how they're nine lanes in traffic. Well, six lanes of traffic on either side.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.440]   It's still not working. And it's just so, so, so, so stuffed. I wish I could remember where I saw
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:50.720]   that, but anyway, so just like a slow zoom out. We're going to show you a lot of comments on this
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.640]   one. Listen, we started off talking about Apple, and then we started... We got into the city...
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:59.600]   Here's... So, here's the thing. I'm going to be taking a break. I'm going to be taking a break here.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.320]   I will admit that city planning is something I think about almost every day for the last 30 years.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.200]   So, it's not something that I'm not paying attention to. It's just... But, but I've just concluded
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:15.440]   that it's all broken. I must not have the forcefulness of Leo Laport. I... We will be taking a break
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.400]   here shortly, but I do want to point... See? Oh, there it goes. But I do want to say... I was just
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.560]   saying that like now, see, you gotta play... You gotta play a zone defense now. You used to be able to
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.040]   play like a man-demand defense, because now we got like two people in one studio, and the rest of you
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.960]   are just like loners. That's what it is. Technically, we are like the setting of love. I gave you an
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.160]   out. I said, okay, this is what we're about to go on. And then you said, go ahead? And I was like,
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.840]   "No, no, because this is what I want... That is exactly what I want to know. I think that...
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:54.640]   One of the things that gets a little frustrating is the idea that folks who are here with our
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.200]   thoughts and opinions, it is our whole vocation to be sharing these things,
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:08.880]   should not... The idea that we should not share every aspect of that. And a podcast that's about
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:15.280]   Apple stuff when we're having a conversation about Apple providing for the housing crisis,
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.200]   then you have to have a conversation about the housing crisis and everything that involves. And
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:26.880]   to put forth the idea that, oh, they're not talking about computers and phones at this time,
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:34.000]   I think does not do justice to the conversation that we're having. So I am happy and glad to
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.960]   let you talk about that. Because I think in the end, we got to a really good point, Alex Lindsey,
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.520]   that you were talking about with city planning and how... I mean, if we're looking at... If we care
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:47.440]   about this company, if we care about this company, Apple, and the products that they make, and we care
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.120]   about what they're going to do in the future, then we have to care about where they're going to go
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.880]   in the future and who's going to be able to work there in the future and what that means. And if it
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:02.320]   means finding a place that is less... Was it less or more density and less cars than that by golly?
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.280]   That's what we're talking about. So I am happy to let the conversation go on.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.920]   And by the way, I don't say... I wouldn't claim that I have any sort of answer. My only thing with
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:17.680]   both the taxes and the city planning is that it is far more complicated than just saying we should
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:23.440]   tax them more or they should do this. There are a thousand things. It's the same thing with the
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:31.280]   fires and the power outages in Northern California. There's so much blame to go around. So I think
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:38.400]   that it's just that nothing's ever there. Clear. Can I say this is quite an about face for Apple.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.520]   Because remember when Steve Jobs went before... Steve Jobs would never do this.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:49.680]   Remember when he went before the city council when they were getting the permits for the
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:57.040]   Spaceship Campus? And one of the city councilors said very timidly. So in addition to all the
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:03.440]   construction you're doing, Mr. Steve Jobs, Mr. Steve Jobs, CEO Steve Jobs.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:10.560]   Would you consider maybe building a Wi-Fi infrastructure for the rest of the city?
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:19.680]   Sir, which would be cool. And he said that our thoughts on that subject is that we pay
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.360]   you guys an immense amount of taxes and then you guys can take that money and build what you want
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.840]   with it. Oh yeah, I remember watching that. So we're not getting up like path. Okay, fine.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:36.320]   Yeah, I remember watching that that court room or whatever wherever it was. Yeah, the city council
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.680]   meeting. I do think that the only thing I'll say about the Bernie Sanders thing with the Apple
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.560]   building is that when corporations do this, I mean, it's fine. It would be you would probably
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.280]   get more of it if we didn't whack them on the head every time they said they're going to do
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:54.320]   something new. You know, that's like if we just said that's great and he can keep on going. We
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.160]   can keep on figuring it, you know, figuring out other ways to tax them or do whatever you want.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.840]   But it would be nice to encourage them to do it, not say, hey, we're going to do something and then
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:07.520]   immediately use it as a way to whack them on the head is not a way to get more corporations to
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:12.320]   make that work. So you're specifically talking about Bernie Sanders there as opposed to because I
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:18.640]   I don't think that Apple there was a conversation recently about us. I don't know what it was that
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:24.800]   Apple did, but it was a technology decision. And somebody I had said something about it in the
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.280]   the idea that why doesn't Apple? I wish Apple would do this sort of talking about my own experience
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:36.240]   for what I wanted Apple to do with I think it was the iPhone having the newest iPhone having a USB
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:42.480]   C port instead of a lightning port. And someone said because of the blowback they would get
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:49.120]   if they made that decision. And does Apple really give a care what people are saying on Twitter
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:53.200]   as a company? They have they have coverage is what they have. Does Apple really care about that?
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:58.160]   Are you specifically talking about the Bernie Sanders who can actually, you know,
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.600]   influence policy and things like that? Is it because it was him saying that that it matters?
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:09.440]   I think that all all companies pay attention to it. To Twitter or to Bernie to all of it to all of
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.000]   it. There's whole teams that are paying attention to what everybody else is saying about them.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.680]   That's part of being a big corporation. Well, paying attention versus
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:23.280]   or they pay a lot of attention paying attention versus I've made this decision.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:30.080]   And they're I mean, removing the headphone jack got a lot of blowback. They still did that.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.880]   And then they continued down the path of creating wireless. They don't they don't they don't make
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.320]   all the decisions based on that. I mean, any corporation, I'm not saying Apple, but but I'm
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.080]   just saying that there's a lot of meetings about everything.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:45.920]   And so, you know, and there's everything's a calculation, you know, and and everything is,
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:50.400]   you know, and so for any corporation, any company, I mean, I, you know, when when we're doing stuff,
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.520]   we think about, you know, how it's going to look everything you do you think about it. If
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:46:00.000]   you're not thinking about that, then you're eventually going to get bit. So, so I think that
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.160]   all corporations think think about those those things. And so when you create in, you know,
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:10.720]   someone like Bernie Sanders creates an environment that makes it, you know, less interesting to do
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.200]   that, you know, like, you know, like, and, and, you know, and it's fine. It's just silly.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:25.280]   He can be. Well, I don't mean there's all these there's all these. I don't know when I'm right
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:31.360]   next to you, I can go like this. Oh my goodness. All I was gonna always gonna say is that like
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:38.320]   the my only really big problem with Bernie is that he can come across as genuinely cranky
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.720]   as opposed to here's a problem. Here's how we solve it. And so this is this is why when he
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:48.640]   come, it can be expected that when he says that, Oh, how dare Apple give $2.5 billion
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.040]   nation, like, again, let's look at the let's look at the terms of like what they're doing.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.960]   Let's also accept that they're they don't have to do this. They're doing this voluntarily.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.520]   We can we can have a long complicated debate, but maybe we can wait four days before we start.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.720]   You know, wait until you get to the next like, fried chicken breakfast, a big chicken breakfast,
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.040]   or whatever prayer pancake, whatever thing you're doing as a candidate. Right. I'm sorry.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.240]   I didn't mean that. When we come back from the break, we're gonna have a long conversation with
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.880]   Louie Gittel. I only did it because I thought people would laugh at you. Just keep talking like
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:24.080]   until that time. I want to tell you about zip recruiter. We're bringing you this week's episode
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:29.520]   of Mac break weekly. Thank you, Karsten. Hiring can be a slow process. In fact,
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:37.280]   cafe Altura's COO Dylan Miskowitz needed to hire a director of coffee for his organic coffee company,
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:42.240]   but he was having trouble finding qualified applicants. Then he switched to zip recruiter.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.600]   Zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding you. It finds them or you. Its technology
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.920]   identifies people with the right experience and invites them to apply to your job. So you get
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:57.280]   qualified candidates fast. Dylan posted his job on zip recruiter and said he was impressed by how
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.840]   quickly he had great candidates apply. He used the candidate rating feature in zip recruiter to
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.560]   filter his applicants and was able to focus on the most relevant ones. And that is how Dylan found
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:12.000]   his new director of coffee in just a few days. With results like that, it's no wonder four out of
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   five employers who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day. So I
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.120]   wouldn't even know where to start on finding a director of coffee. And Dylan Miskowitz was able
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:28.720]   to not only find that director of coffee in two days or in just a few days, but also to filter
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:35.040]   the candidates out so that just the right person could be given that job. And this idea that zip
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:41.840]   recruiter goes and says, you know what, it's not about you sort of having to put your thing out
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:48.400]   there and hope that these that the folks out there are going to find your job listing and apply for
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:55.040]   it. No, zip recruiter invites them to apply for your job. So it finds the good people that it wants
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:00.160]   that you're looking for and says, Hey, we've got something here for you and helps you get the
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.280]   candidate that you would like to interview. You can see why zip recruiter is effective for
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   businesses of all sizes by going to zip recruiter.com/macbreak. So try zip recruiter for free at our

[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.720]   zip recruiter. If you're looking for somebody to be your director of coffee or whatever it happens to
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:45.360]   be, then you've got to check out zip recruiter. All right, AirPods Pro. Let's go ahead and we're
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:52.720]   going to move away from some of those other other topics. I'm curious, Lori Gill, when the AirPods
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:50:00.960]   first came out, you and I were having a conversation and you said to me, how do they feel for you?
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:07.680]   I had mentioned that I was watching several episodes of the office, I think it was, and I had said,
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.760]   you know, they don't hurt my ears. I kind of have had them in for a few hours as I'm watching the
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:18.640]   office and they aren't giving me any pain. However, for you, the first and second generation of AirPods
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:24.160]   did kind of give you some pain issues. Have you had the opportunity to try the new AirPods Pro?
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:32.320]   Oh, Smapsky. Look at that. They're in leaves. Let me tell you,
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:40.000]   Micah, I mean, I'm so excited to talk about this. I've loved the idea of AirPods since they came out
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.440]   and they've been a source of frustration for me because of the pain they bring. I get about a
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:50.080]   half an hour's worth of use before I start to feel a little bit of an ache in my ear and then
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:54.960]   after about an hour's use, it really starts to like really hurt and I'm pulling them out and
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.760]   putting them back in and kind of messing with my ears to give them a little bit of safe softness
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:07.280]   by two hours. I have head fatigue. I start to feel pressure all over my whole head and not quite
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:13.200]   a headache, but it's just more like head fatigue. So I pop in AirPods Pro, honestly thinking it's
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:18.720]   probably still going to be just as uncomfortable. I have multiple times worn these for the four and
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:24.480]   a half hours that you can get out of battery life, straight, no pain, no problem whatsoever.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.800]   It's the best feeling in the world. I love AirPods Pro so much.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.920]   Yeah, what size are your tips are you using? Or is that too personal?
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:41.120]   I'm using the small ear tips and they come with the default ear tips. I popped those in and it said,
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:48.080]   this is a good seal. This is a good fit or a good seal. And I thought, I doubt that. So I went,
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.920]   I switched over to the smaller tips, the size small, put those in and it said the same thing,
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:52:01.280]   that this is a good fit too. So anybody who is about to get AirPods Pro or even if you have them
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:08.560]   in your ears right now and you used the size that Apple says is a good seal, that doesn't mean that
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:14.560]   it's a comfortable fit because all it's telling you is that with that particular tip in your ear,
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:20.960]   the seal is tight for active noise canceling. You might find a larger or smaller ear tip is
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.920]   more comfortable for you. So test out all three of them and figure out which one feels comfortable
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:34.720]   and has the right seal to it. So yeah, the comfort level is absolutely extraordinary.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:39.600]   And I've, I've got, I had this amazing experience yesterday. I've, you know, I've been testing,
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:45.520]   I've got my review halfway done. It should be done today and up on iMore by tomorrow at the latest,
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:52.320]   I was outside while somebody was using a leaf blower and they're basically like the one of the
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:59.920]   loudest pollutants for the size of a machine that they are. Right? It's so small and yet it's like
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:09.520]   wrong. Right. They're really loud. I was about 12 feet away from, from a leaf blower. I even
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:16.480]   looked at the, my Apple watch to check the noise, the noise app. And yes, it was at,
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:23.440]   it was around 77. It sometimes hit 80. So it was loud. The environment outside was loud.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:29.360]   It sounded, I was standing that close and it sounded more like I was inside a house with all
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:35.760]   of the door shut and in a room with the door shut and the leaf blower was across the street.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:41.280]   It was barely audible. I could tell that it was there. I didn't have to turn up my music that I
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.960]   was listening to. I could still hear my music just fine even though the snow, the leaf blower was
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:53.760]   about 12 feet away from me. It was incredible how well these tiny little things were canceling
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:59.840]   out that loud noise. That's awesome. I, so I actually recommend, I suggest that folks start
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:04.080]   with the smallest ear tip. Even though it comes with the medium, put the smallest ear tip in your
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:11.840]   and click them on to the AirPods and then try those out first and see if the seal is good. And then if
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.640]   Apple, if the things is no, then go up from there. So starting at the smallest and working your way
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:20.320]   up is probably better than if you start at the medium size and because you've squished it into
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:26.400]   your ear canal, it's going to have that fit. Yeah, I have had a similar experience. I have not had
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:32.640]   too much of an issue with the pain in the past. But as far as it goes, I've been very impressed. I've
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:40.480]   used Amazon's new EchoBuds and had those since I think Monday or Tuesday of the week that AirPods
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:45.200]   Pro came out and the boys, the boys, the boys, the noisy noise cancellation, the
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:53.760]   those noise cancellation is pretty good. But in comparison to Apple's ANC, I've been genuinely
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:58.560]   impressed. And I think part of it, honestly, is the way that Apple like ramps up the ANC. It's
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:04.480]   almost like someone's blowing a bubble around you. And then suddenly the bubble surrounds you. And
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:10.000]   it's like this. And then you can't hear you can't hear the stuff that's out. So I've been really
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   enjoying them. And I've been using them with a transparency feature as well whenever I'm in
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   environments. In fact, I was using them this morning while I was getting ready for iOS today.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.920]   And I was able to still hear everything, but listen to music at the same time. And that was
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:34.240]   quite nice. I've seen generally good reviews of AirPods Pro. And I'm curious, gentlemen,
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.720]   have either of you tried them out yet? Are you using them? Are you interested?
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:47.440]   I haven't tried I haven't tried them yet because my my uses are multi platform enough that I feel
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:53.760]   as though I have to wait until spring to see what other $250 earbuds I can get that might work as
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:56:00.080]   well for my uses. So I haven't tried them yet. I'm really curious to see like Mike and Laurie,
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:04.960]   like how essential is it to get a really good fit on those ear tips, not just so that they're
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.360]   comfortable, but so that the active noise cancellation really works well. Like, is it
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.760]   worried about like if you if they're a little too small, do you have enough leakage that the
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.120]   whatever it's doing to try to figure out what's going on outside versus inside the ear doesn't
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:23.440]   work very well or the tips have a really great design to them. I'll try to show you. I'll show
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:29.360]   you my disgusting my disgusting your tips. Let's see if I can do this. It might be too.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:36.960]   So yeah, there it's got this very wide fit to it. It's not one of those double tiered ones or
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:44.240]   anything. It's it's got a nice wide tip. So, you know, even size small ear tip, or it's likely
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:50.880]   that it will create that seal in anyone's ear because it's designed to kind of, you know,
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:56.160]   expand push itself out without being without being painful. It's designed to
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:03.280]   push itself out and give you that seal. So, I've never had to fiddle or, you know, maneuver it or
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:07.920]   anything to make sure that the seal is there. It just happens as soon as I put him in my ear,
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:15.280]   I get the the official sale. In fact, just now taking that out of my ear, the ambient noise in
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:21.840]   the air sounded weirdly loud to me in my in my ear that was just naturally listening to sound.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:27.280]   It suddenly was like, wow, there's a lot of like fan noise out here that I never noticed before.
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:33.520]   Because that seal, it just kind of takes away all that kind of like, you know, the noise of
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:38.240]   your computer and all that kind of stuff. It just takes away all of that. So, it's going to be
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:45.040]   back in the matrix. Send me back to the matrix. Yeah. And Andy speaking to that question as well,
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:52.320]   I've used Bose quiet comfort in ear earbuds for airplane rides and things like that for a while.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:58:01.600]   And those, it's a similar kind of fit where it's almost less about creating that perfect
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:10.000]   in ear monitor seal and more about getting a good enough like lock in your ear that when the ANC
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:18.240]   is active, it so I would say the seal is not. Yeah, exactly. It's not soup. It's not so important
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:25.680]   that if you jostled the ear pod or the the air pod, that then suddenly, you know, the ANC feature
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:31.120]   would, you know, it wouldn't work as well. I've found it to be, I can just sort of pop them in.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.400]   I don't have to think too much about how I push them in. And it still does a good job of keeping
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:42.000]   that sound out. So, yeah, I don't think that it needs to be an exactly perfect fit for it to work,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.400]   which is one of the reasons that I think I've been so impressed with it. The going back to the
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:53.920]   echo buds really quick, just sort of as a comparison there, there are a lot more fit options with the
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:59:00.080]   echo buds. And I'm seeing some people in the chat who are talking about how they, their left
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:07.360]   air pod pro was not, it could not get it to fit for them. And so they ended up having to send them
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:12.960]   back. And like every, it worked for the right one, but the left one didn't because you don't
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:19.760]   necessarily have symmetrical ear canals. And I hope that I was just thinking about this yesterday.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:28.640]   I hope that comply, which makes all sorts of materials of custom ear tips for all sorts of
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:33.280]   in ear headphones and whatnot. I hope they're working on a pair for AirPods Pro,
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:39.120]   or multiple designs because they've got like the sweat proof design. They've got the comfort
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:43.440]   design and I can't remember what the other ones are because I really do like comply ear tips. And
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:49.120]   I think that for some folks who need to have multiple sizes, that would be good. One of the
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:56.160]   things that I want to sort of celebrate Apple on, in fact, Renee, whenever he first got his hands
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.840]   on these AirPods Pro, he sort of called me out on Twitter because he knows how
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:08.880]   grossed out I am by earwax and that whole thing. I'm happy that my body produces earwax and it
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:14.720]   helps with my, like it does what it's supposed to do. I'm happy that it does what it's supposed to do,
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.680]   but it grosses me out. And so he was saying specifically to me, let me know that Apple said
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.240]   that you can get some replacement tips for very little money. But aside from the fact that you
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:30.960]   can get replacement tips, what Apple has done this time that I think is so great is the tips of the
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.320]   device, you know, the things that you can take off and replace, they have what is essentially
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.560]   what they call in other headphone tips, an earwax blocker or earwax grid or...
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:50.080]   Yeah, exactly. It has gutters. And so you don't end up clogging the actual speaker
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.440]   in the actual AirPod like you would with the last generation models with earwax. Instead,
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.400]   it goes into the tip. Yeah, see, there's... So Lori's holding up right now the speaker and that is
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:06.960]   completely covered by a wax guard when you click the headphone tip on. And I think that's great.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.160]   That's going to make them easier. It's going to mean that you're going to have less replacements
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:18.000]   and you're not going to have so many issues with them, you know, going bad or in my case. So
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:26.400]   I wanted to run an experiment. I have accidentally washed my AirPods in the past, not the AirPods
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:32.080]   Pro, but my AirPods. And they were fine afterward. Well, for the longest time, the AirPods that I have,
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.400]   one of them... I've talked about this before, but one of them completely didn't put out any sound,
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:42.400]   and the other one put out sounded about 50% of its normal volume. And so since I got AirPods Pro
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:48.640]   and the only other thing I could have done was thrown away the AirPods, I decided to take the
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:56.800]   AirPods out of the case, put them into a delicate laundry bag, zip it up, and put them in with my
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:04.080]   wash and see what would happen. I washed them and took them out, let them dry, and I put them in my
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:10.560]   ears. And the one that was at 60% volume was up to about 90% volume. And the one that I haven't
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:17.280]   been able to hear out of for months actually was putting out sound. So it was genuinely earwax and
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:21.600]   dust. I'm going to get sick, grossed out here, but it was genuinely all of those things that were
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:26.880]   causing the issue with me being able to hear sound out of it. So that is part of the reason why
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:34.240]   these things are so horribly... The longevity of them is such an issue is because we are humans who
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.840]   produce different types of fluids that end up... Fluids and materials that end up clogging up these
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.960]   speaker grills. So I'm happy that Apple's working on that or has changed up that process a little bit.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:52.240]   Well, I was curious if anyone had any other thoughts on that because that is a perfect segue
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:03:01.440]   into this excellent CBS news report. It says, "People love AirPods so much they spend more than half a
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:10.560]   billion dollars a year replacing them. Seven hundred million dollars a year go to replacement
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.400]   AirPods and cases. That's about five to seven percent of our sales." I think that suddenly does
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:20.800]   receive that generous to have 2.5 billion to spend on healthy... I got that on me now.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:29.280]   Well, I think that the hard part, my wife spent a long time, a couple of years resisting the...
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.720]   Every time she was having trouble with her headphones, I was like, "You know, the AirPods would make
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.840]   that better." You know, there was a little like, I was like, "I'm not going to fix that because I
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.200]   told you how to fix it and I'm now going to just wait for you to give up."
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.240]   She finally gave up.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.520]   It took me five years.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.480]   Anyways, I'm good at it.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.040]   Well, we call it the little hammer. So anyway, so I should watch "A Shaker Dimotion."
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.400]   It's like a little hammer. So anyway, so that's my whole life. Anyway, so, but
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.840]   she finally got the AirPods and now she constantly was telling me, "This is amazing!
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.160]   Like, there's just so much better." And I was just like, I'm just like, the key is not to rub it in.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.560]   Right, yeah. You don't like telling me so. Yeah, you just...
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.480]   Yeah, I'm really glad you're enjoying it. And she just... She loves them. And I think that's
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:23.600]   the problem is that they're so... What Apple figured out how to do is just get all the pieces to work.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:28.000]   You know, it's very easy to put them back in their charger. It's very easy to have them charged.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.920]   It's very easy to put them in. You can tell which side to put it in first and there's not.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:39.520]   But it's all those little things that I have literally 8 or 10 Bluetooth headphones as I've
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:45.520]   worked through this process of being so dedicated to a set of headphones that would work. And now,
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.720]   you know, having the AirPods, the thing is that Apple just figured out how to make it easy.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.600]   I can fit it in my pocket. It's just the rounded corners that slide right into your pocket and
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.400]   slide back out. The fact that I want to open it up, I know which iPod, you know, which head
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.320]   earpiece goes where and they just pop in and they snap in. And you don't... You know, there's
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.400]   all these little things that make it work. And even the simple things where they understand that
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.680]   I've been waiting in line at the grocery store and now I'm at the head of the line. I'm going to
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.160]   pull out one ear pod. Oh, I bet that means I should pause the playback because he wants to have an
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.800]   interaction with the crew of Bing until you put it back in the case and which is, oh, it's not just
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.200]   a temporary interaction. He really just wants to hear out of one ear for the next... Okay, again,
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.840]   yeah, it's those little things that when you spend... We've all talked about how much these
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.720]   things spend these costs, but it's less about being cheap and more about being frugal.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:41.600]   If you spend $250, $260 for a pair of earbuds, you want the experience that Apple will give you
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.200]   where they did not screw up anything that... I mean, my biggest concern, which is fixed in the
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:53.360]   pro, is that I haven't gotten you. I went last night to get them in. There was an Apple store
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.720]   right next to my hotel. And so when I got in Boston and I was like, oh, I was going to get
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:03.120]   something that didn't have them. So, but the... We have a local Apple store, Alex. We have
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:08.480]   time... There are lots of restaurants near it. We could have... We could go check. I think we should
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:15.040]   go deep in that. But the green place near you. That sounds perfect. Yeah, so the... But I think
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:20.320]   the one thing they fixed was that when I'm still on a plane, I don't use my ear pods. I'm not because
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.360]   of the time, but because I can't hear what's going on. So I still have my edomotics that I use
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.120]   for planes and I still have a wire and I connect it. And it feels like a truck. You know, like,
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:34.880]   "Chon chon" or "This is a wire tank." But... And I have my little converter. I have my converter
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:42.400]   for lightning. I have my converter for USB-C. And so I... So I think that they fixed that. The one
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.480]   thing that was really problematic for me. Well, for longer flights, battery will become a problem.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.720]   Well, then you just have two pairs and you can switch out.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:57.040]   Yes. Yes. I try not to admit that I have... I might have two pairs. My day per hour.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:04.160]   I think I have three pairs, so don't worry. Oh my goodness. Well, while we... Go ahead.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:10.640]   No, I was gonna say that I have an empty iPod case charger.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:17.760]   Yeah. So did you lose a pair of air pods? No, I swear I haven't lost them. I'm just saying...
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.160]   Well, you get to the... You go to the nightstand or the dressers, "Okay,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.000]   I'll name my air pods." And you flick them open and they're not in there. And you know that
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.880]   they're somewhere in the house, but now they could be anywhere in the house. And so now I may as well
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.960]   just buy a new pair because... I've never experienced that. I never experienced that.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:42.000]   And that's why I have two. Yeah, exactly. I think if... With the regular air pods,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.400]   I just... They weren't good enough or they hurt too much for me to wear them regularly. So if I had
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.640]   a lost one, I would just spend like, oops, I guess I lost one. But with AirPods Pro,
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:57.120]   if I lost one AirPod, if I lost both AirPods, if I lost the case, I would go... I would replace it.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.000]   So I would be part of that $700 million a year because...
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.920]   It's the usability of them is so fantastic that it's worth it to me to spend
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:11.360]   some money instead of just replacing them entirely. At some point, you're getting so close to
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.200]   replacing them entire that you might as well buy the whole thing. But an individual bud,
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.840]   or just the case as a replacement because of something you lost, I definitely would do that
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:26.240]   with AirPods Pro. Speaking of... We would be remiss if we didn't talk about the
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:34.800]   zero out of ten repairability score on AirPods Pro. I am not surprised. I don't think anyone
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:45.680]   is surprised that these fancy lads are not very repairable. So when it comes to iPhone repairability,
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:51.520]   I do think that Apple needs to work harder to make them more repairable. I do think that we have
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:59.040]   the right to repair our iPhones. With something as small as AirPods, I never even really thought
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:06.240]   about the idea of repairing them yourself. I mean, they're so small. So a zero out of ten score
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:13.440]   does not surprise me. And it also doesn't bother me because there are just certain things that are
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:19.600]   never meant to be repaired at home. And Alex, you might actually have a different opinion on this
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:28.640]   sort of DIY kind of thing. Is that a big deal that you can't repair your AirPods? They're so small.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:35.200]   But it's not a big deal for me that I can't repair my iPhone either. I think people underestimate
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:40.560]   I do a lot of things that I like to work on. But I also think people underestimate the complexity
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:47.440]   of putting the amount of power that we have in a little phone. Or AirPods or our phone
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:52.880]   to get that much into it as you start to make things modular in a way that you could take them
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:58.000]   apart and put them back together and that they work again. That's very hard. And we're already
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.880]   packing an enormous amount of silicon and other things into these little spaces.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.520]   I think that the idea that we're going to now make it so that there's screws and there's
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.720]   things and there's ways to pop it on and put it back in. A lot of the stuff is surface mounted and
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.720]   put in, create done in a clean room. And there's so much stuff there that I just think that I look
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.200]   at it like, well, that's the, I don't know, I mean, being able to recycle it, I think is important.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.800]   I think that if it doesn't work, being able to send it back and they have little machines that do
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:33.440]   that. And as Annie pointed out, not people. But it writes repairs, usually not so much about me
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:38.320]   individually being able to repair it. It's usually more about, well, Apple, you're going to allow
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:43.440]   third parties to do third party repairs and you're not going to. I would never, and I think my
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.760]   problem is that I'm sure that the, I guess we can talk about the right. I would never let a third
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:54.800]   party touch my phone. Like, okay, let's see. Ever never never. I don't even buy a phone from
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.040]   some other party. Let alone, let them actually touch it. I want you to. I don't let my wife touch
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.200]   my phone. I want you to form a picture in your mind of a freelance journalist in a rapidly collapsing
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:12.000]   market. You can do so by turning it this way. And imagine that like, I actually have this individual
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.320]   spent $270 for a pair of headphones and you find out that they're dead in two years, but because of
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.120]   a battery that cornered the chair down doesn't look like a custom battery. It looks like something
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.560]   you can actually source somewhere and imagine him trying to picture himself, spending $200,
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:35.360]   $70 to buy an entirely new pair versus going to some kiosk or going to some provider via mail
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:41.120]   that will send you back a working pair of fixed, I'll fix your products for $60. I can't remember
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.160]   the dude's name, but he's got a YouTube channel and his most popular video was he,
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:51.280]   he was an engineer. I think he was living in Shenzhen for a while. And so he got this idea of how
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:56.160]   how difficult would it be for me to build my own iPhone? Because in the Shenzhen market,
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.680]   you can find secondhand parts. And the great things about these videos is that like he did
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:07.200]   another video of, well, I've got a 16 gigabyte iPhone. How can I upgrade to 256 gigabytes?
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.840]   And so he found out, okay, here's where I buy like the right chip. And then, okay, well, I need
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:17.280]   a special like, I can desolder it with this special tool from this market. But I need this template
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.600]   in order to put the solder balls back on correctly. And someone will sell you like the template for
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:27.040]   this. And the point being made is that here's somebody who is very, very clever, but he was able
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:32.000]   to self teach himself and acquire the tools to do something as complicated as swapping the memory
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.040]   capacity of a working phone. So that's not something that I would like to do. But again,
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:44.320]   if I've put a lot of money into a pair of headphones, if someone wants to figure out how to perform
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.280]   that repair, I'd be more than happy to who send out an unauthorized repair and have these fixed for
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.480]   $80 instead of having to buy a brand new pair, which is not only just the cost, but it's also,
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:01.120]   again, kind of calling that it's just a battery and batteries. Like there, there, we've killed
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.400]   entire segments of the of the environment. We've built so many batteries. One of these batteries
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.400]   should be able to repower these headphones. So that's what I'm talking about. It's like,
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.000]   it's not about me trying to fix things. It's about making sure that if someone wants to build a
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.320]   business out of that, and wants to acquire the tools for it, that there's not, at the very least,
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.520]   it's not going to be anything artificial. Like, I don't know a special app that has to sign off on
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:29.840]   the validity of a battery or the validity of a screen before it'll actually render the phone
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:37.520]   operational again. Yeah, mixed opinions with the screen thing, because with the screen thing,
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:43.120]   it's also about the fingerprint sensor there. And when it comes to that, I want to make sure that
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:50.640]   my security is, but I agree with your base point. When it is something as simple as a battery.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:58.080]   In fact, not too long ago, I had replaced, I have like an old school Kindle. It's a Kindle
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:04.080]   keyboard, the first model, I think that had the keyboard. And I got it for Christmas one year as
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:12.000]   as a young youth. And I loved that thing so much. And I sourced to the battery whenever it went out
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.400]   the first time and was able to repair it myself. But now they don't make the battery anymore. I
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.600]   can't find it anywhere. And so now it's just this piece of plastic and whatever else that thing is
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:29.440]   made of etch a sketch. And it makes me very sad that I can't repair it. So making those things
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:35.040]   available to us, I agree with you. I think that finding that happy medium is important.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:42.320]   I have a bunch of non off brand Canon batteries that I'm that worked fine when they worked with
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.760]   the still phone. But with my still camera, when I use them for my Blackmagic camera, for instance,
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.960]   they halfway through, they just decide not to work anymore. And I asked Blackmagic,
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.320]   well, the first thing I called Blackmagic and I was like, okay, my camera keeps on turning off
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:00.160]   in the middle. Like it says it's full and then it's just empty. And he goes, is it a, is it,
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:05.200]   you're using a Canon branded battery? And I'm like, no, and he's like, and I said, are you checking
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.200]   for it? No, no, no, we're not checking for it. It's just the cheap batteries get driven really hard.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   And they're not as good as the Canon batteries. And so now I have all these batteries that I bought,
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.480]   much less than the Canon batteries. And now I have to go back and rebuy them because
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.320]   they're not as good. They also, well, they also might point they also could be counterfeit. I had a
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.040]   counterfeit battery for my Olympus. I didn't figure out because it looks absolutely identical in
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:30.000]   every way shape or form to the other three in my bag. Only F. Oh, gee, I'm out of battery. I
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.960]   only taken 70 pictures like, Oh, that's right. I've been, I was taken eight months ago and I still
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:39.360]   get taken all the time. I mean, side to side matters. Side matter. Lori, were you about to say something?
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:49.120]   I thought I heard you speak up about something. I get so distracted when these boys talk.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.120]   Whoa, we're going to go to a break here. This episode of Mac break weekly, we haven't even
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:00.800]   broken out the puppets yet is I was hoping for puppets. But this episode of Mac break weekly is
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:06.640]   brought to you by Eero. Yes, Eero, Eero. And let me just reach to the side here. I'm going to grab
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:12.880]   something. Eero, it blankets your whole home. I don't know why I'm looking at the sheet like I
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:19.200]   don't know about Eero. I have Eero devices in my home long before I ever came to Twit as a host.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:25.120]   I've had Eero in my home, blanketing my house and Wi-Fi. I've got one main Eero router with the,
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:32.480]   I think that's the base station. And two of these, these are the Eero beacons. If you have a larger
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:39.120]   home, if you want to sort of spread the Wi-Fi across your whole space, me, for example, I have a
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:47.360]   three floor townhomes and each of those floors, of course, have material in between them that can
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:53.440]   lead to signal degradation. And so I've got an Eero base station on the top floor because that's
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:17:00.640]   where my office is. And then an Eero beacon, I have plugged in in the main floor and then one in my
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:06.160]   garage. And so no matter where I am in my house, it's being provided with excellent Wi-Fi that
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:14.640]   blankets the entire space in beautiful connectivity. And with the Eero beacon, you know, this plugs
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:20.720]   directly into the wall. If you want to show this here, it plugs directly into the wall. But what
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:26.560]   I love about it is, you know, sometimes you're kind of remiss to give up a plug in your, in your house.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:32.720]   But this is not just your extra Wi-Fi that's being added to your home. On the bottom of it here,
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:38.320]   this little strip that you can see is actually an LED light strip. So when I plug this into the
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:44.240]   wall, it has an ambient light sensor inside of it. And you can set it up so that when you're
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:48.960]   lights turn off or whenever the ambient light in the room is below a certain level, it will shine
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.920]   that light down and give you a little bit of a night light wherever you are. You can turn this off
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:59.040]   if you don't want this feature, you can turn it on or you can set it to, like I said, change
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.040]   between different times of the day. And then there's also an LED light at the top that kind of gives
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.440]   you information about what the current state of your network is. And you can also turn that off.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.120]   So if you're a person who's like, I don't want any lights shining off of this thing, I want it to be
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:17.680]   as unrecognizable or it doesn't stand out at all. I want to be inconspicuous, then you can make
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.920]   that setting happen. So I quite like, I guess I've got two of these beacons in the home that are
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:31.760]   part of the experience. So you don't need to worry about standing on one foot and petting a cat while
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.640]   singing Christmas carols to get the Wi-Fi to work in that one room of your house where it's not working.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:42.720]   No, with Iro, you you blanket your whole house on Wi-Fi and you get the fast signal everywhere.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:46.480]   There are some like range extenders and things like that that can sort of push your signal where
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:51.840]   it needs to go, but it's not giving you that full bandwidth that you need no matter where you are
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:57.600]   in your home. What's great is that Iro sets up in just minutes. You plug it in to your modem,
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:04.160]   or if you have a modem/router box, first of all, Pro-Tip, use your own system. Don't pay for that
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.440]   rental fee to the ISP. Get your own modem, use this as your router, you're going to be so happy,
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:14.400]   I promise you. And you can manage it from the simple app, the Iro app, which I love to use. So
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.080]   you can see what's happening on your network at any time. I have this great thing set up to where
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.240]   every time a new device joins my network, it says, "Hey, there's a new device on your network."
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.880]   And I can say, "Okay, that was me. That was definitely me." Or, "Whoa, did someone guess my
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.840]   password?" You can block devices that you don't want accessing your network. You can set certain
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:38.000]   profiles so that certain devices can only access the Wi-Fi at specific times, or can only use so much
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.320]   of your bandwidth. It's fantastic. You can pause the Wi-Fi completely at certain times. So if your
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:48.000]   dogs are constantly surfing on their iPads when it's dinner time, and you're just like, "Henry and
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.560]   Mizzi, can you please stop? I'm trying to have dinner with you." Then you can pause the Wi-Fi.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:56.160]   They won't be able to access their candy crushes, and I don't know what else they play.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:02.000]   And you can get alerts for all sorts of things, like I said, including devices attempting to join
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.920]   your network when there are new security updates and things like that. It makes it simple to share
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:11.040]   your Wi-Fi as well. Iro protects and secures the traffic flowing over your network through
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:17.120]   advanced encryption and security protocols. That includes safe filtering so you can block
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.960]   content, like I said, inappropriate content, but also phishing sites and things like that.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.360]   And with a network that expands to fit your needs, you're going to be able to stream,
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:31.360]   work, and play from every corner of your home. You never have to think about Wi-Fi again with
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:38.320]   Iro, and that is genuinely the truth. Every time I've had to move, I call my ISP that I'm signing up
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.600]   with and say, "I've got my own modem. Stop charging me every month." And I plug in my Iro to that modem,
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:49.360]   and my Wi-Fi is just ready to go. It's so lovely. You can get yours fixed as soon as tomorrow

[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:29.600]   of my home because my internet, in fact, when I moved from Missouri, my family was very sad that
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:36.320]   I was taking my Iro stuff with me, and I said, "Well, you're just going to have to deal because I got
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:43.840]   to take my Iros with me. I need them." And of course, I can't get the box back together, but that is Iro.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:55.280]   Oh, righty folks. Apple TV+ is here. It has launched. It is available. And I've got to tell you,
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:00.560]   I have not had an opportunity to watch any of the shows, but I've heard good things about,
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:06.080]   and this is a specific question now that I think about it for Mr. Alex Lindsey over here.
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:11.120]   I heard some really good things about the streaming quality of Apple TV+. Do you know
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.280]   if they're doing something different that makes it look better? Yeah, they're not compressing as much.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:25.280]   I mean, I don't know anything secret. If you look at the bandwidth that people have been
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:31.840]   reporting, a 30 meg stream is a lot of data. For 4K, to put that online at that level,
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:36.720]   most times when we're talking about 4K streaming, a lot of us are discussing 12 to 15
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:41.520]   megs per second, and they're reportedly, according to some of the articles, I haven't tested it,
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:46.000]   but doing like 30 megs a second or 29 megabits a second, or, you know, and it would peak bit rate
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.200]   of 41 is what they're saying in the article that you're showing there. And so that's just throwing,
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:57.280]   I'm sure that they're spending a lot of time to make it look great, but at the same time,
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.840]   what they're also doing is just throwing more bits at the problem. And I think that it's absolutely
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.360]   necessary for them to do this because they're going to, I think Disney's going to do the same thing.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:11.760]   You know, they're going to set, you know, because I mean, the Netflix is all about quick start
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:16.480]   and all about, you know, all kinds of other things. And it just looks, you know, I know that when I
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.120]   want you Netflix, it looks best on my iPhone. Like if I make it any bigger than that, I'm going to
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:27.040]   be frustrated, you know, and I think that when we saw the fiasco that was Game of Thrones on HBO
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:35.120]   now, you weren't so bad. It was when my wife is like, what is when my wife asks,
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.880]   what is happening here? Like, why is this looking this way? Then you know that there's something
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:45.120]   very, very wrong. You know, I complain about everything, you know, but when she's picking it out,
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:51.040]   you know, it's a big deal. My kids, I had to explain to them what macro blocking was, you know,
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:56.960]   and so, so I think that there's, I think part of the competitive race between, I think mostly Apple
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:03.040]   and Disney is going, they're going to predicate part of their value proposition on quality of the
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:08.080]   video. Because we've been given really bad video, even by our cable networks, you know,
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.800]   Comcast and everything else. I was going to ask, is it would my ISP have the ability to say,
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.040]   we don't feel like basically handling all that bandwidth. We're going to knock it down to 12.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:21.200]   They can't. So, so what happens is, is that when you're sending,
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:27.520]   this is the rumor is this is what actually happened to Game of Thrones in some cases.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.200]   So what happens is, is that when you're when you're when you're running a compression,
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.720]   when you're when you're streaming something to someone, you're streaming a whole bunch of
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:39.440]   resolutions. So you're providing on a server, you're saying, I've got, you know, I've got all
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:47.200]   these res, I've got 16 versions of this that are everything from 4k to phone, right? And so,
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.680]   there's all of these bits that are available on the server on the on the edge. And then there's a
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.280]   manifest and that manifest is this basically a document that just tells the ISP, this is what
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.640]   you have access to, you know, you can pick this, you can pick this. And so no, usually that's done
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:06.560]   by the player. So the player is your player, your Apple TV, your phone, whatever is looking at the
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:11.360]   manifest and going, well, you know, I, you know, it's looking at basically the performance, like how
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:16.320]   fast is the are the bits coming to me as a player? And it says, you know, I think I think I'll move
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.600]   up wrong. This is way too much for me. I'm going to move down. And so when you see it changing,
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.720]   it's making a decision based on the performance that it's seen in how quickly the bits are getting
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:31.920]   to it. And this manifest that it has. Now what the ISPs have the ability to do. And I've never seen
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:35.040]   them really do it that much. But I heard that they did it with going with thrones because the
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:40.400]   demand was so high is that they can take they basically manipulate the manifest. So they basically
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:46.480]   take out options. So when the player gets that manifest, you know, as it comes through, it comes
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.520]   through and they took some of the stuff off the menu, and then they took the pickle, they menu
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:57.280]   and off the menu. Okay. You know, the worst part is is that people get caught up in people get caught
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:02.000]   up when it comes to compression, they get caught up in resolution when in a lot of times, we would
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.920]   be better off with lower resolution, but more bits per pixel, you know, and, and so you, a 720
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:13.920]   stream sometimes looks better than a 4K stream if you're at the same bit rate. You know, if the
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.560]   bit rate is too low, that it can't represent that 4K stream, you're now you're just ending up with
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.080]   all kinds of blocks, you're ending up with Game of Thrones, you know, and so, so we can just
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.640]   we can just refer to Game of Thrones as bad compression and bad screenwriting. So anyway, so
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:31.360]   the, so the, oh, okay, send the emails to Alex Lindsay. I don't want to be any part of that.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:36.480]   It was great until, you know, season until they had that Starbucks cup in there. That's when it all
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:41.760]   went wrong. Oh, no, no, no, no, and they even admitted it like these guys, you know, the, the
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.040]   showrunners admitted it last weekend that they didn't know what they were doing. So anyway, so
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:56.640]   anyway, but the, the, but with the bits that chances are Apple's not going to create demand at the
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:01.680]   ISP level that is going to require them to do that. Game of Thrones was a unique situation where
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:05.760]   there's a lot of people that want to watch it live or want to watch it very near when it's when
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:11.200]   it's there. And so Apple is creating a, you know, Apple not not that as many people want to see,
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.320]   you know, you know, so, so I think that, you know, so the, I think that they, you know,
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.000]   we don't see that very often. I mean, usually you're getting those things. And as a user,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.320]   I would much rather be told you're going to have to wait for half an hour to watch this,
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.960]   but it's going to be great. You know, I would, I would prefer them to give me 80 megs a second.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.480]   I don't care. You know, like, and just, and just tell me like I can schedule one I'm going to watch
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:36.400]   like, hey, I'm going to download it because I don't watch the movies. I don't say watch movie.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.240]   I say download the movie. Right. And then I go about doing what I'm doing. And when it's ready,
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.520]   I come back and I want that to be a great experience. And I think that if you're talking about,
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:51.280]   you know, Apple's talking about 4K, they're talking about, you know, HDR, when you're talking
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:54.640]   about those things, you know, having to be a crappy experience is not a good way to sell that
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.640]   technology, you know. And so I think that they're definitely going down the right path. And I think
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:03.200]   they have to do it because I think Disney's death. Disney's been holding back 4K. So they haven't
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:10.800]   been giving anybody 4K. So it seems like that's what we're going to see there is really high
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:18.560]   quality from Disney as well. And they bought the BAMtech BAMtech. So MLB,
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:25.920]   so major league baseball is why all streaming that you watch is kind of they're one of the big
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:31.680]   definitions of HLS, which is how you get a lot of their stuff. A lot of that spec has been defined
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:36.960]   and pushed by MLB. You know, they got in early and they streamed a lot, you know, like a lot of
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.680]   stuff and they had a lot of complaints and they have a lot of suggestions and they have a lot of
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:44.560]   things that they want. It's one of the great stories of dog fooding where this, if we were,
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.960]   if this technology existed, we would make so much bank, but it doesn't exist. So we're going to
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:54.720]   have to develop it. Right. And you know, the level, like when you talk to anyone that has worked there,
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:29:00.640]   like talking about how they manage redundancy and processes like at a whole different level than
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:08.480]   anything that I usually do. So Disney bought that, bought them and basically has been slowly
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:15.920]   pushing off clients because they just want to, they only care about their service.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:23.920]   So they have state of the art team. They're pushing hard and I think that it was very smart for
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:28.000]   Apple to go in and make sure that we're going to get a high quality experience on our expensive
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.840]   TVs. So will the major, this is a little off topic, but will the major, will Major League Baseball
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:39.680]   still be streaming that way? Are they going to also push them off too, Disney? No, no, no, I think
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.520]   that Major League, I think that they're not going to push MLB off, but I think I think
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:48.720]   that will be has its own internal and now I'm going to say this on air. So I don't really know,
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:52.240]   I don't really know how the two of them are intertwined. They're not going to kick them off.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:30:02.800]   But BAMTech was an offshoot of MLB that was for external clients. So I think that's what
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.080]   Mm-hmm. I think that's what Mm-hmm. I don't think they ended up with the MLB infrastructure,
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:14.240]   which is astounding. Now, Laurie, did I more do any coverage on helping people with getting their
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:20.560]   Apple TV+ subscription to work? I saw some talk that people had trouble redeeming their free year.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:27.040]   What do we do? How do we get our free year? It was kind of on day one, it was a little
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:34.240]   confusing. I even actually my iPhone, which is my qualified device, even was a little bit wonky
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:40.800]   when I first opened up the app. First of all, it's in the TV app. So that's where you find it. You
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:44.880]   don't, you're not going to get an email on how to subscribe or anything like that. You might,
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:49.120]   actually, you might get one that says, "Don't forget that you can get Apple TV+ for a year."
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:57.280]   But you just open up the TV app and scroll down until you see, get your free offer. If you have a
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:06.720]   qualified device and you still see this seven-day trial, tap on it anyway, because it should just
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:14.560]   take you to the actual offer for the one-year subscription for free, because it's registered
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:23.680]   your device. So Apple's information states that it has to be claimed on the qualified device,
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:30.320]   but a couple people that I've talked to said they found that offer on different devices.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:35.760]   So if you are on your qualified device and you still don't see the offer and you tap the
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:40.480]   seven-day free trial and it does not take you to the one-year free subscription,
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.640]   go find another device, one of your other Apple devices that your Apple ID is signed in with.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:52.720]   Try it that way. There's been people saying to restart your iPhone or sorry, your qualified
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:57.520]   device and see if it pops up that way. Really, a lot of the confusion I think was just in
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:05.760]   who actually gets to trigger the qualification. There's also a lot of people that were claiming
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:12.480]   that they were getting the free service when they didn't think that they were supposed to get it.
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:20.640]   So a couple of things I'll just note really quick. It doesn't have to be an iPhone 11 or an iPhone
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:30.160]   11 Pro. It can be any device that Apple is selling right now on their website after September 10th.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:37.840]   So if you bought an iPhone XR after September 10th, that qualifies. If you bought an Apple TV
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:44.880]   1080, that qualifies as long as you bought it after September 10th. Apple watches do not qualify.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:49.360]   So if you bought a brand new Apple watch and that's all you bought this year that will not qualify.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:55.120]   It's iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs and Macs. You can't watch it on an Apple watch.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:33:00.880]   Yeah, what's up with that? I just want to see it on my iPad touches, by the way, are also
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:08.480]   qualified. So if you can go watch it on iPod Touch, it qualifies as well. So if you're thinking,
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:13.680]   "Ooh, I got the free your service and I wasn't supposed to." You might have actually been supposed
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:16.640]   to. You just didn't realize that you're device qualified. I don't think Apple's
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:23.840]   trying to kick people out. I think the point is, is a reasonably, they're just looking for
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:29.200]   a, in my opinion, they're just looking for a reasonably good reason to give it to you.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:35.360]   Like, you know, we're going to host this Apple pie. We'll give it to you. We would like to talk
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.440]   in the next quarter about how. Yes, exactly. Or yes, you know, because that's how you get more
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:44.080]   folks in Hollywood to sign up contracts with you. Not that. And Tim Cook said in the Apple earnings
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:51.840]   call something to that effect, which was, it's basically marketing. We want a lot of people to test
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:57.680]   out this service and we want to give those people enough time to find out that they love this service.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:03.680]   So we think that, you know, this is Cook saying, we think giving them a year free is going to prove
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:09.520]   to them that this is a service worth keeping and we're willing to, you know, take that, take that
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.880]   hit in order to give the service to enough people to get the word of mouth out and give them enough
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.680]   time to realize this is something they want to take. I think it's changed.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:23.360]   Yeah, I think it's definitely a way to do it, particularly because they're competing with how
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:29.280]   many different services they're starting up, most of which their firepower is what kind of
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:35.920]   libraries can we acquire? $500 million just for the South Park Library for one service.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:42.080]   And so Apple, they're very cognizant that they don't, they are not in the acquisition of libraries
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:47.280]   business. We are in the development of original series and acquisition of movies and documentaries
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:51.200]   business. So they, I think they understand that for the first year, they're not going to win
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:57.120]   based on content. So let's get people who are, who the shows that we do have, it will find their
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:04.400]   fans. People will get trained to use the TV app as not just for Apple TV, but also as their point
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.640]   of access to all the other TV apps they have. My biggest complaint about the TV app, I think my
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.720]   whole family's biggest complaint about the TV app is that I just want to be able to have filter
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.880]   out things that I don't have a subscription to. You know, like I am tired of it telling me that
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:21.200]   it's available on some service that I don't care about. You know, like I'm not subscribed to that.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.680]   So let's take that out. I spoke Korean and was interested in the soap operas.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.640]   That would be a great thing to inform me of Apple TV, but as is,
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:37.680]   a for effort, but yeah, I don't know. So another, another thing here. And I, this is an interesting
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:44.720]   story to me given that there's not that big of a difference. The New York Times put out a piece
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:51.520]   behind Apple's quote, slow role marketing push for its new streaming service. And in it, they talk
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:36:02.080]   about a report from, let's see, it's I spot TV that says Apple spent 19.9 million dollars on
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:06.880]   television commercials for happy, happy, happy TV plus, which is the kids version of Apple TV
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:14.640]   plus. That's not true. And that same month, they spent 38.6 million on ads for the iPhone.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.160]   So again, about 20 million dollars on Apple TV plus and about 40 million dollars on iPhone.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:28.160]   That same thing was the case in September where Apple spent about 15 million on Apple TV and 30
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:33.040]   million on television for, or for the iPhone rather. So it's about half of the cost that they're
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:37.760]   spending on iPhone. And the argument here is that where Apple is pushing, putting its marketing
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:44.480]   budget is the thing that they care about more. I think that's a very simplistic view of that.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.400]   That's good. I'm glad we all feel.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:58.240]   Unformed, completely silly. So the fact that they're putting half of what they're putting into
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:03.360]   iPhone, the thing that is half of their revenue, the big piece of pie, the fact that they're putting
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:08.960]   half of that into Apple TV is an enormous amount of money into something that probably isn't going
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.520]   to generate any significant revenue for another year. You know, that there's a dump into that is
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.480]   an immense commitment to what they're doing. It is not that it's half as important as the iPhone.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:24.480]   The iPhone is generating half of their revenue. That is the, that's all I could say.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:30.960]   Yeah, I'm just going to sit away. To follow up with that mathematical analogy there,
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:38.400]   we're talking about, you know, services is 20% of Apple's business right now. And Apple TV isn't even
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:46.160]   a part of that at the moment, because when they had, when their earnings call happened, they didn't
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:52.320]   really have services, the TV plus as part of their services. So to spend half of their budget,
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:59.120]   or you know, half of what their iPhone budget for marketing is just on one thing that isn't even
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:05.360]   part of the 20% of their services revenue, that's big. That's a lot of spending.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:11.840]   Proportionate to the ROI. It's probably 100 times. You know, the iPhone expenditure.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:16.800]   Exactly. Yeah. Okay. I'm glad we all feel the same way about that because I was thinking,
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.240]   one of our first saw this, it talked about this slow role. And of course, the New York Times reports
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:29.200]   it. And then a lot of the blogs that cover Apple took that story and sort of regurgitated it in
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:35.840]   some ways to say, did you know, Apple's got this slow role marketing plan? And it just felt a little
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:40.480]   bit from the from the get go a little bit silly. They're really good at English class, not as good
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.800]   at math. Yeah. Perhaps that is the case. Are they good at English?
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:53.280]   There is a lot going on here. It's like, I'm reading the reviews of a lot of the shows,
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.040]   and a lot of them are turning into reviews of Apple TV itself. And it's like, what an immense,
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:04.320]   as if you don't have enough stress launching a brand new show as a showrunner, the fact that
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.760]   people are going to judge the efficacy of the world's largest tech company's ability to
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:15.280]   serve TV at all based on whether the first three episodes of your new series that you don't think
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.200]   is going to really heat up until episode six anyway, because because Lily Hammer was amazing.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:25.200]   Yeah. Sorry. It was horrible. Did you ever watch Lily Hammer?
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.960]   Nope. Can't say I did.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:37.120]   Two to I certainly don't think show reviews should have anything to do with the user interface of
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:42.720]   the TV app, absolutely. But the user interface of the TV app, especially when you're watching TV
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:49.520]   Plus shows is terrible. It's terrible. At the end of an episode, I was trying to get the
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:55.360]   actor's name so that I could write them down in my review. So I'm trying to pause, and it would
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:02.560]   just try to force me into the next episode. And you can't quickly go back to all episodes.
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:09.920]   You're just stuck in this, I'm stuck in this episode, and I can either go to the next episode
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:14.400]   or go back to the I couldn't I don't even remember what it is. But I remember thinking like this is
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:20.640]   such a bad design for the user interface. I feel locked into this episode. And I don't think it was
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.160]   intended that way either. I don't think they're trying to lock me into that episode. It was very
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:30.880]   frustrating. Yeah. Auto play is the as the bane of I think any streaming service. I cannot tell you
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:36.240]   how much I hate when like I'm watching I'm watching Hulu. And I'm enjoying that I really
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.920]   enjoyed this week's episode of Bob's Burgers. I'm so happy and full of love. And then I don't know
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.800]   what it is about the human brain. But I see now an episode of whatever is gonna start to suck at
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.800]   five. And I'm like, Oh my God, I gotta defuse this bomb. I can't really hit the pause button.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:57.120]   Yeah. So that doesn't start playing this show I didn't ask for. And yeah, it's it's so annoying.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.200]   And then it's gonna start recommending that to you because you accidentally watched 30 seconds.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:08.000]   And then I completely understand. One question we have in the chat because I've seen this with
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.960]   Amazon Prime video. You can while a show is going on, I think they call it x-ray or something like that.
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:23.280]   You can see who the people are in the show. Can you press the Siri button on the Siri remote and say,
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:30.800]   who's on the screen right now? And will it show you the actors that are performing or do we don't know?
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:34.320]   I have no idea. Well, I don't know. We'll have to try that.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.240]   Just because I haven't thought it's a really great question. The feature of the feature on
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:45.120]   Amazon is pretty damn nice. It's it is practically like live annotations. As you go if you turn it on,
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:48.880]   you can turn it off. But if you want to know, here is this person, here is their character,
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:54.080]   here is the the background of here. So many of their programming is amended that way. Because
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:57.440]   especially when you're binge watching and they want to reintroduce somebody that you haven't seen
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.360]   since 2pm earlier that day when you accidentally decided to give Miss Maisel a try.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.480]   Yeah, that's the first stuff that accidentally.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.840]   It's 8 o'clock. My kid is probably still in soccer practice waiting for me to pick them up.
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:16.720]   But yeah, but that's it's a great it's a great feature. And one of the things I'm looking
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:22.160]   forward to most of all with Apple TV Plus is to see if they find a way to make their TV
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:30.000]   something better than simply a playback a digital VCR and make it a way that makes me enjoy
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.040]   television a lot more. I mean, it's just a simple act of making sure the captions are always correct
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:42.480]   and not simply phonetic and making sure that there's a way to when you're doing a fast forward that
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.600]   maybe there's just some cues to say, Oh, well, here every time just like when you're doing a search on
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:52.480]   Chrome, if there are like 12 incidences of this word, they'll put like little yellow pips in the
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:57.360]   scroll bar to let you know that the thing that you would look for are here, here, here, here and here.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:03.600]   The amazing it's nice to have so many different TV apps to compare these things to because
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:11.120]   I've always blown away that YouTube is a surface that is owned by Google or the alphabet. The
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:16.720]   app, the YouTube app is created by Google and alphabet. I'm running on a Chromebook that's running
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:22.480]   hardware and operating system made by made by Google. But the interface for this damn thing is so
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:28.160]   crap that what how do I how easy is about YouTube TV? No, I'm talking about I would talk about
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:32.640]   about well, I'm talking about experiences where it's like, I just missed something. How do I go
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:37.920]   how do I go back like 20 or 30 seconds? And on one app, you can double tap the screen on the desktop,
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.840]   you can't do it that way. Or how do I do picture and picture while you need a special plugin?
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:46.160]   I just go like I like I would never give up YouTube TV, by the way, I love YouTube TV. So I
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:51.600]   that is my live television, you know, conduit, right? And I love the fact that I can just hit
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.400]   record on everything. I do lots of everything recorded all the time. Like it's just like
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:00.800]   everything's on DVR because it's just a metadata. It's not put in anywhere, you know, it's just
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:06.800]   saying you want access to that later. And I because I do research on broadcast, you know, I just have
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:10.880]   all these things on record. And so so I love YouTube TV, but it feels like you're constantly
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:14.000]   fighting it. You're like, you're like trying to like, no, no, no, don't don't start artist
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.080]   scrolling. Don't don't go here. Don't go there. You know, so I get that that these things are
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:24.320]   complicated. But but I will say that that I feel like every update to Apple TV is worse than the
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:29.600]   last one as far as my user experience, which seems like it's going backwards. Yikes. That is a bit
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:37.040]   of an issue. Folks, we are are going to be back with, well, we've, you know, this show could very
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.280]   well go for three hours if we let it, but we won't let it. I promise. Don't you worry. Remember,
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.560]   this is Mac break, not Mac. Keep going. I don't know. Mac day. Yeah, there we go. Yeah.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:49.760]   I feel as though he's talking to us. Alex, I don't know. Not even not.
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:54.640]   Not at all. Not at all. I am. I'm loving this conversation. And there's really so many topics
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:59.440]   to cover, but we can't get to them all. However, it is time to take a little bit of a break here
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:04.000]   to tell you about Express VPN. I was just talking about virtual private networks and how important
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.560]   they are. And I've been using Express VPN for a while now across all of my devices. It's a really
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:16.400]   reliable way to make sure that my data on all of those devices is secure without having to worry
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.040]   about slowing down my internet speed. Often that's a big issue with virtual private network is you
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:27.440]   turn it on and then suddenly it takes forever to load a page. Now Express VPN doesn't do that.
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:33.360]   They make it awesome and super easy to get it turned on, get it, we'll get it installed,
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:37.760]   get it turned on, and then still have that reliable connection that you're looking for.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:43.440]   Now why should you care about encrypting your data? Why do you need a virtual private network
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:49.680]   to encrypt your data? Well, it's because it's easy for hackers to bypass Wi-Fi security and
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:54.880]   get at your information. There are flaws such as crack. That's key reinstallation attack.
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:00.960]   The researchers who find these flaws who report them often come up with clever names for them.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.680]   And in this case, it's crack. If you ever use Wi-Fi at a hotel or a shopping mall,
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:10.000]   well, stop doing that without a virtual private network. Seriously, if you're listening to this
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:17.040]   right now at a hotel, just quit listening, go get Express VPN and then come back and
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:21.120]   start listening again. You're going to be a lot safer with that. You're sending your data over an
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.840]   open network. That means there's no encryption at all between you and the people out there listening.
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:29.520]   The best way to ensure that all of your data is encrypted and can't be read by hackers is by
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:33.920]   using Express VPN. You can download the app on your computer or smartphone and then use the
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.800]   internet as you normally would. You just tap or click on the one button to secure 100% of your
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:43.840]   network data. It makes it super simple. And one of the things whenever we first were checking out
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:49.200]   Express VPN, they said, "Oh, get an account and go from there." Is all the places that this dog
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:54.320]   on thing is available. It's available on so many different devices. So whether you're running a
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:47:00.160]   Windows machine, you're running a Linux machine like Leo, I think I just felt that disturbance in
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:06.480]   the force, as I mentioned, Linux, your MacBook, your Apple TV, your set top box, whatever.
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:11.600]   Express VPN is there for you. You can get it installed everywhere, which is fantastic.
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:18.400]   It's fast, it's reliable, and it's recommended as the number one VPN provider by both TechRadar
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:24.080]   and CNET. And here's where things get exciting and I start nerding out. Express VPN takes privacy
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.560]   and security to the next level. The way they do that is by inventing a technology called trusted
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:33.920]   server to ensure that VPN servers run from RAM and no data logs are written to a server's hard drive,
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:39.520]   even by accident. I heard about this. I remember listening to Leo was talking about Express VPN.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:44.960]   And I think I was in my office in the other room in the studio and he was talking about this
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:50.480]   trusted server technology. And I was curious about what that actually meant. So I went to Express VPN's
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:55.360]   website and started reading about Express VPN's trusted server technology. And folks, it is really
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:01.760]   cool. So a lot of VPN services out there. And first of all, a VPN service, if you're wondering
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:08.320]   what the heck is going on there? Normally it's you on your device connecting directly to some
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:16.560]   client somewhere. So if you are watching a YouTube video, then you are connecting over the internet
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:22.080]   to that YouTube video. And then it comes back, you get to watch on your phone. But what Express
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.880]   VPN and other VPNs do is they sort of provide something in the middle. So we'll use the microphone
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:35.520]   as the example here. So your data goes to Express VPN stuff. And then from there, it goes to the
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:41.280]   video that you're watching. And then it goes back to Express VPN, and then goes to you this virtual
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:46.720]   private network in the middle keeps it so that this video knows that it's you that's watching said
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:54.720]   video. Now, a lot of VPNs out there will use hard drive technology to run their servers to work
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:00.560]   with this VPN. And the problem with that is that those are often stored for a long period of time,
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:06.640]   your data, your browsing history is stored on those servers for a long period of time. And so if that
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:11.200]   data is ever compromised, or if a government entity comes and says we want access to that,
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:16.320]   then they can get access to that Express VPN does their stuff on RAM. That's a random access memory.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:20.880]   It's volatile. That means when the power gets flipped off, whoop, all that data is gone. It does
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:27.360]   not stick around. And all of Express VPNs trusted servers have this technology. So it's never
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:32.080]   writing to the hard drive. It's immediately gone the moment it gets done. But what's even cooler,
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:38.160]   in my opinion, is the fact that every single one of their servers is all running up to date software
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:44.320]   at all times. How they do this is that when they refresh the when they turn the servers back on
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:52.000]   afterward, they've got one, one device that is then reinstalling the OS again, the server
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.800]   technology again onto each of those servers. So it's always going to have the latest and greatest
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:00.480]   version always be up to date. They're not worried about some servers that are still running,
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:06.800]   you know, last month's process is no, it's always up to date. That is trusted server.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.800]   I had to geek out about that and tell you all because I think that is really what sets Express
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:15.120]   VPN apart. You're not worried about them holding onto your data. A lot of times that's the issue
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:18.800]   with a VPN. You pay them money and then they instead of your internet service provider
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:23.360]   attracting you, especially PN's using that RAM. It goes away. So they don't want your data. They
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:28.640]   don't care about it. If you want the best in online security, truly, and privacy protection,
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:34.960]   head over to expressvpn.com/macbreak. And that's going to get you three extra months free
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:40.560]   when you get a one year package. Protect your internet today with the VPN I trust to keep my data safe.
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:47.280]   My browsing safe. Head to expressvpn.com/macbreak to get started. Thank you expressvpn
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:54.480]   for keeping my and Henry and Mizzie's data secure as they play their games that I can't get them
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:57.920]   to stop playing. We're supposed to be eating dinner. Throwback. All right, folks, we are back.
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:05.840]   We have to talk about Adobe because the Adobe Max conference took place and Adobe Photoshop,
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:15.120]   real Photoshop on iPad is finally here after so many months of them promising it. And they also
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:21.920]   have given us a little preview of Illustrator for iPad, which I think is great. So yeah.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:29.760]   It's pretty cool. I downloaded yesterday. It's pretty thin right now. The iPad version Photoshop,
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:34.000]   there's actually some things that you'll try to activate. And it says this in orange. I'm sorry,
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.640]   this feature is coming shortly. We're working on it. Right. And it's important to note is that
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:42.240]   note their language very carefully. They say that they've been promising all along
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:47.040]   real Photoshop. They didn't promise the complete Photoshop. And when they say the real Photoshop,
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:51.840]   that mean that the same pipelines, the same code that is powering these whatever features are
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:56.880]   crossing over, you're seeing the exact same thing. So if you're trying to do, so if you've got a
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:02.640]   Photoshop file in the cloud with layers with certain effects that you will have, you don't
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:06.880]   have the separate app that is doing its best to pretend to be Photoshop. It will be Photoshop.
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:10.880]   But don't expect that you're going to get every single blend mode. You're going to get every single
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:17.520]   pencil tool or paint tool. But it's pretty, it's pretty satisfying to see how it works. And
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:25.680]   I'm really keen to see if it will convince iPad users to subscribe to like a Adobe Creative
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.640]   Cloud package or whether it's more likely to encourage people who are subscribing to creative
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:34.080]   cloud packages to buy iPads because it could go either way.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:39.440]   Yeah, I haven't, it was, it came out while I was traveling. So I haven't, I haven't downloaded it
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:45.840]   yet. But I think the one complaint I saw was that it, that it, the raw is not like it's not
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:50.480]   supporting raw, which seems like a, there's a lot of things you can leave out. But leaving that out,
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:54.240]   when people are looking for something serious, they're like immediately like, I don't understand,
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:59.680]   you know, so, so that I think that was probably a not a home run, not a great thing to lead up on.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:03.440]   Yes. Yeah, exactly. I probably would have waited until I had that, you know, to release.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:08.000]   So, but I think it's great. I mean, I think that a lot of us are still looking for that great
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.040]   editing package. There are, you know, there, there are other editing packages on the iPad.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.920]   They're not, you know, they don't, I think the hard part for a lot of us,
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:23.280]   I use, you know, I have Pixelmator and Affinity and, and, and Photoshop. The problem is I started
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:27.360]   using Photoshop in 1991. So I have a heart, you know, there are certain things like I tried,
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:32.640]   I keep on trying to use Affinity and Pixelmator for stuff. And so I go over there and I use it
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:36.480]   for a little while and then I go, okay, can't, you know, and it'll always be something silly,
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:39.840]   you know, like, like, I need to be able to export TGA files and they don't, they're like, well,
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:43.120]   that's not a modern architecture. And I'm like, okay, what I still need it, you know, and it would
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:48.240]   take you like a weekend to write, you know, like, you know, it's not, it's a, it's a file format,
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:55.440]   you know, it's so, so, but, so, so there's little things that I need that keep on bringing back to
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:00.480]   Photoshop. And I think that's Adobe's advantage in modernizing it and getting it on the iPad
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:03.360]   is something that they have to do. And I think they're doing that fairly well. And I think they've
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:10.000]   done a great job in general of figuring out iOS, both Autodesk and Adobe saw this coming.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.440]   They've been putting out little apps for years, you know, to test the water, figure it out,
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:19.520]   figure out how they're going to make it work. And then they've kind of backed up and put something
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:23.280]   real out. So I think that they've, they've approached it in the right way. Yeah, I agree.
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:30.160]   So one, I tried out Photoshop this morning. And for for iOS today, talked about a little bit. In fact,
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:35.040]   you should definitely check out iOS today, because we talked about all of those things,
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:42.000]   both the process of using Photoshop now on the iPad, as well as Illustrator, which will be coming
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:48.240]   out soon, some AR stuff. And then we had Rosemary Orchard on and she went into depth about her
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:53.920]   writing process. It was, I seriously, it was a very, very, very good episode. And that's all
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:55:01.200]   thanks to Rosemary Orchard for coming incredibly prepared. And with even, we were switching between,
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:05.360]   I just have to talk about this for a second, we were switching between, of course, as you normally
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:09.440]   do the switching between cameras, but she had it set up to where she could show her iPad view,
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:14.640]   even though she's coming to us all the way from her home office in Vienna, I believe. And I just
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:20.560]   thought that was fantastic. So it was a great show. And if you want to do great stuff on your
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:25.360]   iPad or your iOS device, then you have got to check out this morning's episode, because it was,
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:33.120]   I'm beside myself with how awesome she was truly. But anyway, back to this Adobe Photoshop.
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:39.040]   There's also Adobe Aero, which is an AR thing. We were having some trouble with that this morning
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:45.040]   when I first launched it. The axis was off. And so the camera was backward and I forced quit it
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:51.360]   and tried it again and it worked a little bit better. It's clear that that fits more into Adobe's
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:57.840]   kind of weird, underpowered iOS apps versus the full on processes. But one of the things,
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:05.120]   it's weird for me. When I first started learning Photoshop, when I was in middle school, so as our
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:11.920]   manager, Colleen said today, oh, so you mean yesterday? Yes, it wasn't that terribly long ago
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:16.400]   that I was in middle school. But when I was almost has a beard people. Yeah, come on.
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:24.720]   So a year ago, when I was in middle school, I spent several summers, well, not several,
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:29.920]   but a couple of couple summers learning how to use the Adobe suite of apps and Photoshop was my
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:36.160]   main one. And I was a freelance graphic designer early on in high school. I did that kind of as a
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:42.480]   side gig and went to do that a little bit more later on. But my point is I have used Photoshop
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:49.040]   for a long time, but not for photo editing in the way that some people do, where you're lightning
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:55.360]   up things and changing. Lightroom was kind of always my tool for that. And so the raw support was not a
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:04.800]   be all end all kind of broken at launch feature for me. I was really excited because Lori can attest
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:10.960]   to this these days because I don't do freelance graphic design except whenever I'm designing
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:16.160]   podcast art on the rare occasion. Lori can attest to the fact that what I like to do with Photoshop
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:23.440]   is turn jokes that I make with friends and with coworkers into weird Photoshop manipulations.
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:30.400]   So there was one time where Lori was talking about, I believe was it involved a goose or something?
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:36.480]   And I think maybe you said the goose is getting kicked and I have a thing that I really want to
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:43.120]   kick a goose. Yes. Lori really wants to kick a goose. So of course I had to because they're
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:50.640]   so big and fluffy. You're so big and fluffy. I just want to kick you. That didn't come out.
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:56.320]   That I never connected those two together. But I do you do you do you kick squirrels in the park?
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:04.400]   Lori they're not like a fluffy. They're fluffy and believe me this close to winter they are pretty
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:08.720]   darn big. They're not as as apparent as hard to kick as you might imagine though.
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:16.880]   Well, apparently not as kickable as as a goose. But so I took that and I can't find it now. I'm sure
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:22.160]   it's it's probably somewhere. But I took that information of her wanting to kick a goose and
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.120]   may use Photoshop to create a photo where she is kicking a goose. Thank goodness Lori's a rock star.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:35.280]   So here's evidence right now if somebody tries to use that against me, there's proof that this was
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:41.040]   photoshopped and that I didn't actually. Exactly. There were no goose. No, I mean the first thing
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:47.200]   that Osbourne did was kick a bat alive bat. And then it just went out of hand and suddenly by a
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:52.560]   baby. That's how it's kind of normal. It always starts with a with goose kick or with the kicking
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:59.680]   goes from there. So anyway, I'm excited that now when somebody makes a silly joke, I can use my
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:05.200]   iPad to create this thing. I don't need raw photos. I just need the ability to have multiple layers
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:10.720]   and masking and with the apple pencil and direct manipulation, it'll be even easier for me to make
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:18.240]   image masks to make Lori kick a goose or whatever jokes. No, you don't have to make her. You just
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:24.160]   have to try to stop her. That's the hard thing. Yes. It is very difficult to get her to not kick a
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:29.440]   goose. Learning all kinds of things today. Let me just speak here. I have never kicked a goose.
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:36.160]   They're just so big and fluffy. You just want to go kick when reach reach for comment. The
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:41.760]   accused claim. Okay, that's fine. I will include that. Stay now. It's conversation. What I love
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:44.560]   is that it's sort of being a one to be part of it. Believe me, if you were listening to this
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:49.200]   conversation, you would be, you would be, you know, it's sort of being pushed as this idea that
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:53.840]   everybody would understand what she means. I mean, they're so big and fluffy. You want to kick a
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:59.280]   goose. Everybody wants to kick a goose. You know, Lori, Lori, you know, and I would say that
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:02.880]   Larry's they're digging a hole for herself. And there, and there's there you are, like,
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:07.840]   Candor, more shovel. There's a lot of reasons to want to kick a goose. I mean, they're mean.
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:12.960]   They poop everywhere. They go into the garden. There's a sense of empathy. I grew up with
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:20.320]   Gee's. They're stealing your bells. And there we might people say, when people tell my father,
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:22.960]   like, Hey, your goose are beautiful. He's like, please take one home.
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:31.200]   Like, let's get him out of here. How does that song go? Everybody wants to kick a goose.
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:36.800]   There you go. Yeah. Sorry. My voice is shot. Normally I'm beautiful, a beautiful singer.
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:46.640]   Oh, my goodness. I knew I was going to be able to find it. Here is the photo. Let's see.
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:53.040]   Lori kicking a goose. There we go. Yeah. See, the goose even has like,
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:55.760]   I don't even know what to call those like wind.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:58.160]   Yeah, the soul, the soul.
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:02.080]   I was a remorseless killer, like a shark. Yeah. You got that one right. Absolutely.
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:07.520]   Well, knock down. Yeah. It's a very, that was the only photo that I could find where a leg was
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:13.600]   available for kicking. So she sort of just rested against the tree while she kicked the goose across
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:20.800]   the park is what happened there. Anyway, that's why I'm excited. This is the society.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:29.200]   Society will need for. Micah is going to become my meme maker for the rest of you. I will go to
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:33.120]   you whenever somebody says something. I'll just say, Micah, get me this.
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:40.080]   In fact, that is a regular occurrence for me with with other friends as well. So you're welcome to
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:44.320]   join that party of friends who say, Micah, can you do this really quick? And I'm like, well,
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:47.520]   really quick doesn't actually mean really quick, but sure, I'll work on this for you.
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.440]   Yeah. I thought maybe it will be really quick. True. Micah, I would like to become a fast
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:59.040]   moving internet meme that gets me shamed by the entire world and lose every job that I have or
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:04.480]   will ever have. Can you get right on that? All you have to do is tweet something. You don't need my
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:09.840]   help or that. You just tweet the wrong thing and that will take care of it for you. Yeah, or kick
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:16.160]   a goose that will also get you in lots of trouble. I think that covers that. I'm trying to see if
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:22.960]   there's anything else on here that we should cover before we say goodbye. Apple, of course,
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.760]   has issued the update so that HomePod won't get bricked for certain users, which is nice.
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:33.920]   So that's a good thing. We don't want that to happen. And I keep getting that notification
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:41.280]   just by turning it off. Yeah. So other than those news. I thought it was the timer saying,
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:49.040]   stop talking, stop talking. That's what it should be. So yeah, that will call that a day on the news.
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:54.560]   It's time for our picks of the week. So, Lori Gill, you know what? We're starting with you again.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:59.360]   We're starting with you again. Okay. Well, it's we're out of October. So I am no longer
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:05.120]   covering horror, but we are getting into winter. And for some people, we're in winter.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:14.400]   It's 78 degrees for me. So I'm not dealing with a problem. But I am definitely going to pronounce
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:21.920]   this wrong. I have never asked Remy how to pronounce it. I think it's muho. They make these incredible
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:29.120]   insulated touchscreen gloves that are fully insulated all over. It's not just the fingertips
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:35.360]   and the thomes. They make a variety of styles. You can get them in leather or in knit or these
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:41.920]   ones are my favorite because they're warm enough to block out wind, but they're not too thick.
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:47.040]   They're just sort of like, they remind me of like isotoners kind of. They're a little bit thick,
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:52.960]   but not too thick. And I absolutely love these gloves. They updated them this year too. There's
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:58.720]   a couple of little special fancy different differences in them right now, which I don't
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:05.440]   have a period. I've got one coming to me. But they're just absolutely fantastic. They're
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:10.880]   super comfortable. And the entire glove is touchscreen. Let me point that out again.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:16.880]   It's not just the fingers. It's the entire glove. If you wanted to use your palm to swipe, you could.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:21.760]   Your knuckles, if you know your hands are full and you just have to use the back of your hand to
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:27.920]   swipe on your phone, these are touchscreen gloves all over and it works really well. They're
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:34.160]   absolutely fantastic. So these are great for winter. Let me just say, get them. They're amazing.
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:39.680]   So if I had some toe socks of this and I put a goose on my phone, I could kick the goose and
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:44.560]   it would actually move if I didn't know. Everything that you just said is horrifying.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:48.960]   All of that is horrifying. I agree. Thank you. I have some new gloves as well.
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:53.600]   To that like 15 or 17 minute digression on the earwax, I thought that we couldn't top that.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:00.240]   If we all together put our shoulders in or what we can really make this,
[02:05:00.240 --> 02:05:03.200]   we can really make Leo never want to go on vacation ever again.
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:09.920]   I love my moos. I've got some mojo gloves as well. I think mine were like knit and leather or
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:14.560]   something like that. I don't recall, but I need to find them. I have to say really quickly, I had a
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:20.960]   bit of a weird out of body experience there for a second, Lori, because you said it's 78 degrees
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:26.880]   there. Normally, this is where I would usually tease you about you talking about it being winter
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:31.520]   and 78 degrees because I lived in the Midwest and it's probably 40 or something there.
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:37.920]   But I'm not in the Midwest anymore. So I jokingly mocked you a little bit and it's 79 degrees
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:44.400]   here in Petaluma. Excuse me, I'm so sorry. I take back my mocking and I adore you.
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:54.080]   Alex Lindsey, what have you got for us? I've been playing with this camera for a little while
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:06:00.400]   and only. I am super happy with it. You're not even in the same room with this.
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:06.880]   That looks like a transformer. It's a nice. I have accessorized it a little bit,
[02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:16.240]   so I'll explain that as well. This is the Blackmagic 6K camera. This is the big brother or sister
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:27.200]   to the 4K. $2500. The big thing about it is, number one, is that the footage that comes off of it
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:32.160]   is amazing. One of these has changed. It's no longer a four-thirds chip. It's a super 35.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:40.160]   Soft to depth the field, but also much lower grain structure. I've shot up to 5,000 ISO and
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:45.760]   really had been completely acceptable footage. The biggest thing that makes it really fun to
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:53.280]   shoot with is that the interface is so nice. When you're used to dealing with video cameras,
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:07:00.160]   and for a long time, I was very attached to my Sony interface and my R-GUs and G-R-Rs and all
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:07.120]   the things that I had to do. Then Canon had the C300. The most horrible interface ever made.
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:15.280]   They all have these funky, if an electronics company made something and didn't really understand
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:19.120]   interface, that's what you get. The engineers are like, "Well, you can get to everything,
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:25.520]   so then we're done." One of the things that Blackmagic has done is really make the access to
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:30.880]   everything that you want to do in the camera at your fingertips. It's not just that the
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:36.320]   camera shoots great footage. It's not just that it's a small form factor or that it's cost-effective.
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:40.880]   It's that when I want to change the interface, when I change the frame rate, the shutter, the iris,
[02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:45.440]   the ISO, if I want to do everything, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, on the back of the screen. The
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:56.400]   screen is gorgeous. It's easy to get to. It's my favorite camera that I've spent a lot of money
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:05.600]   on cameras. It's probably my favorite camera that I've ever bought for video. I paid for it.
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:14.560]   It's not like they sent me one. It's kind of the core to me to what I'm doing right now.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:26.320]   I love the camera. I didn't want to talk about it until I had time to play with it for a while.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:31.920]   I've taken it all over the world. I've been shooting with it in Cambodia and India and all over the
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:39.840]   US. It's just a joy. Now, what I've done here to accessorize it is I put a small rig
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:45.200]   ectoskeleton on it. I'm just used to having lots of places that I can attach things.
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:51.120]   I immediately take cameras and put skeletons on it. The one problem with this is that it
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:56.480]   means that I can't use the new battery pack that Blackmagic makes for these cameras, for both
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:01.680]   4K and 6K. It's a little bit of a problem because the Canon batteries that I talked about earlier
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:07.920]   last like 10 seconds. The Canon battery will last like 30 minutes, but any kind of other
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:13.120]   cheaper version of a Canon battery will last very quickly. If you set it to raw, it pulls on that
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:22.240]   battery really, really hard and doesn't survive very long. The camera takes a C-fast, which are
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:28.400]   super expensive. I have a couple of them, but these are C-fast cards and they're fast.
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:35.600]   They record and then they also take, you can record ProRes onto SD cards. You have SD-fast
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:41.440]   and you can choose which ones you're using. Now, the other option is putting a drive. It's got a
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:50.800]   USB-C input. You can actually just hook a drive up. I'm using the Samsung T5-1 terabyte,
[02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:58.800]   which is actually cheaper than the C-fast. So you just plug this into the camera and now you've
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:04.160]   got a terabyte that you can just record to. In this little small-age, small rig or whatever,
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:13.600]   it's very easy to, this is all just attached to it. It's much easier to use in the field as just
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:17.760]   to pull this drive out and then plug it into your computer and pull stuff off of it and go back
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:25.840]   to what you were doing. It's using standard EF, Canon EF mount. All your Canon lenses are usable.
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:36.320]   It's just a great camera. My complaint about it is that the biggest complaint that I have is that
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:45.520]   it is when you set it to 6K RAW or 6K sensor size, you're limited 50 frames a second instead of 5994,
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.200]   which is kind of an odd thing. As an American, it's an odd thing. If you're in Australia,
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:54.400]   where they make the camera, it's not an odd thing because they're faster rate is 50.
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:59.760]   So I'm guessing that that has to do with a bandwidth issue to the storage,
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:04.080]   but it's a little bit frustrating. Admittedly, 6K
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:13.600]   RAW at 50 frames a second is a lot of data. So it's on the outer edge of what these things can do.
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:21.280]   But if you've been hemming and honing over this camera, it's not a live camera. I still use a
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:26.000]   lot of different cameras for live. I've used the Mini-Ersis most recently. You don't have the same.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.840]   It's not really built for that. I think you could, with a new little switcher that they make,
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:33.760]   you could probably connect it and you could use it as a live camera, but it's not going to have the
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:39.280]   same features that you'd expect from a studio camera. But as the carrier that I carry around
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:44.960]   to shoot footage and what I'm going to be shooting a bunch of footage on this fall,
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:53.920]   this is the camera. So it's an amazing camera. I think that the backwater is pretty long. I
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:59.040]   think they're making about as many as they can make. So it's really hit a sweet spot
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:06.240]   for the industry as far as price and performance. I mean, $2,500 for what this does is kind of amazing.
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:11.280]   Yeah, I mean, it got ever since he showed it to me, I got this reaction of like,
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:19.360]   I have $2,500. I'm going to make another $2,500. But I'm like, pardon me, he's thinking,
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:23.760]   okay, he's got to go to bed sometimes. Yeah, exactly. I'll be like Indiana Jones with a weight of like
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:31.280]   salad sizes. Oh, you're about to miss your train now. Come on, grab your back. Don't even open it.
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:34.880]   I know I'm forgetting something. I can't figure out what it is. Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:41.520]   So it is quite a thing. He was throwing me how running through the interface and how big that
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.480]   screen is. And it really is the sort of thing that makes you feel as though no matter what you
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:52.640]   want to do with video, it's attainable. You are the worst part of this whole system that you are
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:56.320]   letting the camera down. The camera's not going to let you go. Well, and the thing is, is that when
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:01.520]   you get up as someone who's owned a lot of Sony cameras and Panasonic cameras and Canon cameras and
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:05.920]   in black magic cameras, the one thing you know is that when you buy these other cameras, maybe you
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:08.800]   update them every once in a while, you have to send them in or there's an engineering update or
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:12.000]   there's a process with black magic, you know that every two or three months you're going to get
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.960]   some upgrade. It's going to add a whole bunch of new features that you didn't even know you need it.
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:19.120]   And so, you know, and so there, you know, there's they added like a couple weeks ago, they added like
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:23.200]   a whole new set of features that are leveling and all kinds of other little things that are great.
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:27.200]   And so you just know that when you buy the hardware, you're just going to keep on getting more
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:32.560]   out of it than than what you had before. So anyway, that's my thing. Well, mine doesn't have a cool
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:38.800]   skeleton on it, but I happen to have a black magic 6k camera right here as well. Look at you.
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:45.600]   So now I feel very special. Of course, there's no lens on it. So they said, we'll show it to you,
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:48.640]   but you will probably break it. So we're only going to give you this part of it.
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:54.400]   Because I have no idea what to do with this thing, but hey, it looks cool and it feels heavy.
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:14:01.600]   So sure, 2500. We can bring you some lenses. Oh my goodness, I got to put this down.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:07.200]   All right, that makes me nervous. That's well, anyway, that we have this too. And I think we've
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:19.360]   been playing around with it. Have we been shooting some footage of? Yeah. So you heard that there's
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:26.800]   a little whisper for you that there may be a review of this with Alex, Lindsey and Ant Pruitt
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:33.360]   of the 6k black magic design camera, which will only further convince Andy Anatko that he needs to
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:40.720]   purchase this device apparently. Now, how about that skeleton? Is that multiple things together?
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:45.120]   Is that just like a one? What's the company you go to for your skellies? This is, well, I use
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:48.880]   this. This is small rig. I have to admit that there are other ones that are more expensive and
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:52.960]   this was just the cheap one that I could put on. I mean, not cheap, but inexpensive.
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:15:00.080]   It is an inexpensive one that did what I needed to do. I wasn't super particular about it needing to
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:05.920]   have quarter, 20s in some places and 3/8s in other places. I just need more mount points.
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:13.760]   I don't even know what I'm going to use them for, but when I get a camera, I almost always buy an
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:18.080]   ectoskeleton for it. So I want cheese plates or other things. I have a whole bunch of little
[02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:24.720]   micros, the black magic micros. I just immediately got the wooden camera, a little box for it.
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:30.640]   You can figure out while you're shooting, oh, I need to connect it from the side or I need to
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:35.760]   add another light or another mic or whatever. All those things become simple. It's kind of the
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:42.320]   thing you get when you buy a camera. It also protects the camera a bit from stuff. Things
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:47.600]   like, oh, I got a connected drive. Well, that was just a $20 thing on top of the
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:56.400]   that just mounts to, they make the drive holder. But the point is, it becomes kind of a, I guess,
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:01.920]   a system that you use for that. It also, again, you're not in the room with this thing. It also
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:13.120]   elevates this from sexy to sexy. Yeah, exactly. It's pretty awesome. They packed a lot into one
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:20.240]   piece of hardware. That's pretty darn nice. Oh, well, okay, let's go ahead and move on to the next
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:29.120]   pick, which comes from Andy. Two, a pick and a tip. We were talking about Photoshop and just a
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:34.960]   reminder that not everyone is a fan of subscription software, but I've been subscribing to the
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:41.520]   Photoshop photography, Adobe Creative Creative Suite photography package, which for $10 a month
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:45.200]   gets you the full version of Photoshop and all the daily, all the updates that come with it,
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:51.760]   the full version of Lightroom, as well as mobile apps, and the iPad version of Photoshop is also
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:57.200]   included in that package price, which in and of itself cost $10 a month if you're not subscribed
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:02.240]   to anything else. And when people ask, like, what's the difference? Why do I need Photoshop?
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:09.280]   You don't need Photoshop, but it really is the difference between the ability to do really great
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:15.280]   things simply with a different app within the limitations and the imagination of those developers
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:19.440]   versus with Photoshop, where there's, I don't think there's anything you can't do with it.
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:28.480]   There's a question of, do you know how to do it in Photoshop? So there was, hang on one second.
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:34.240]   Okay, and so that's the, so that I really do recommend it. My photography has sort of taken
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:39.840]   another leap in my personal satisfaction over the past year, chiefly because of the way that
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:46.320]   I've been using it. The other thing I want to talk about is that a friend of mine had a bad
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:54.960]   experience at an Apple store. His iPhone 6 battery died while he was on vacation and he took it in
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:18:00.720]   and I don't think that they were really trying to give him a bill of goods, but they basically
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:05.280]   try to talk him into buying a new phone instead. Just remember that if you have a really, really
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:09.920]   old iPhone, you can still get a new one. You get a new battery installed for $49.
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:15.280]   They're almost always successful. You can back up your phone beforehand by plugging into AC power
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:21.920]   and it's not, don't be, don't, when I mentioned this on Twitter, a bunch of people, one of whom
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:28.480]   was a former manager of a Genius Bar said that it is kind of policy from Apple down to say,
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:33.360]   if you can walk people into a new purchase, walk them into a new purchase, which bummed me out,
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:35.440]   attract the things that I've heard.
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:36.320]   That's their job though.
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:38.800]   No, well not real. I mean, it's,
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:41.760]   their job is to try to sell iPhones to people.
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:44.960]   No, I think that their job, I really think their job should be to say,
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:48.720]   here are the options available to you. If you are perfectly happy with your iPhone 6
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:52.160]   and you don't necessarily want to spend hundreds of dollars on a new phone,
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:55.600]   we can put a new $50 battery in it and it'll be fixed and it'll be working.
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:00.400]   So just a reminder to people that battery swaps are really, really cheap, they work.
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:04.640]   And also even if you have an unsupported phone, there might even be a third party who will be
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:09.440]   able to do it for you. I will say that after an iPhone is three or four years old, the difference
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:12.640]   and the improvements that you will be able to appreciate after having,
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:16.640]   ever have from being on the bench for three or four years are astounding.
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:21.360]   And maybe it is a good idea, even if you're just upgrading to an iPhone 8 from an iPhone 6
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:25.920]   and you're saving a bunch of money, but just make sure you're making that choice,
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:30.240]   not because someone has told you, "Oh, well, sometimes it doesn't work." And
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:34.800]   "Oh, Apple's probably going to stop supporting this in a couple of months anyway." And
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:37.200]   just make sure you're making the right informed decision.
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:43.680]   All right. Thank you for that, both of that tip and that pick. I guess that just leaves me.
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:51.840]   I was spoiled when I was in Missouri for several reasons, but one of those reasons was that
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:59.120]   I had a smart garage door opener. And so I got used to the idea of not having a panic every time I
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:04.720]   got to a new place and thought, "Oh, by golly, did I close my garage door?" That is always
[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:09.040]   something that it's right there at the... I don't worry about stoves being on or
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:15.600]   leaving the hair blower plugged in. Instead, for me, it is, "Did I close the garage door?" And so
[02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:22.400]   most mornings, what I do is I drive out of my garage and I make an active mental point to look back
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:28.720]   as I hit the button and make sure that the garage door goes down. I suppose I could mitigate some of
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:34.000]   that fear by just locking the door that leads from my garage into my house, but still everything
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:40.000]   that's in my garage then is available and vulnerable. So I don't like the idea of not being able to
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:47.520]   know when my garage door is closed or open. And I just happen to see that there's a great deal
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:53.760]   right now on Amazon. It's normally $50 and has been even more than that, but right now it's down to
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:21:01.760]   $30. It's the MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener. And what this does is it allows you to connect your
[02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:08.400]   garage door opener regardless of brand as long as it has the two safety sensors that are in front
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:13.600]   of your garage door. Those are the things that say, "No, no, no. The laser is broken or the signal is
[02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:17.840]   broken, so we're not going to close the garage door." You use that as the tool to sort of determine,
[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:24.160]   "Okay, I've got a new enough garage door that this will work." But this replaces or can be used in
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:29.840]   conjunction with your garage door remote. And one of the devices goes on the garage door itself.
[02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:37.840]   And it acts as the way to tell, "Okay, I think it's got an accelerometer inside if I'm not
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:42.480]   mistaken or a gyroscope." And it can say, "Well, because I'm facing this way, then I know the garage
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:46.720]   door is down. But then if I'm facing this way, then the garage door is open." And so no matter
[02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:52.160]   where I am, I can see the garage door is closed or it's open. But it also has a built-in repeater
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:57.920]   that sends the signal, or it can figure out what the signal is for your specific garage door. And
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:02.720]   you can use that to close and open the garage door no matter where you are. So it is an app-connected
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:07.200]   device that allows me to, even if I got to work and found out that my garage door was open,
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:13.520]   I could easily hit that button and bring it down. So I am returning to what I once had
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:16.880]   with my smart garage door opener. But without getting in trouble with any
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:23.040]   land, without any property managers who would be like, "Why are you replacing the garage door
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:27.360]   opener we've installed with your own?" Don't have to worry about that. I can just use this tool. So
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:33.920]   the fact that it's on sale right now, $30, it's prime delivery ships from and sold by Amazon,
[02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:39.200]   I said, "Well, I've got to do this because I'm tired of having those moments of anxiety where
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:44.320]   I don't know if Mizzi and Henry are going to run out of my garage and take to the streets."
[02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:49.680]   So that is the MyQ smart garage door opener.
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:55.840]   Folks, we have reached the end. We have done it. We can take a break. It is the end of
[02:22:55.840 --> 02:23:01.040]   another episode of Mac Break Weekly. We just have to say goodbye to our awesome guests,
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:06.560]   Andy and Notko of WGBH. And as I said at the beginning of the show, Andy and Notko of Andy and Notko,
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:09.120]   thank you so much for being here. Thank you for your work today.
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:14.160]   Thank you for hosting jobs. Thank you very, very, very,
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:18.640]   very much. You're wonderful. Thank you so much. And you got anything to pitch if people want to
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:23.680]   get in touch with you? How can they do so? As usual, I'll spell my last name, which I got
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:27.760]   the money that you can't do that. But you'll find me on Twitter and Instagram by my last name.
[02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:33.040]   I'm going to be on, as usual, Friday on Boston Public Radio, WGBH, talking about tech stuff
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:36.560]   from the Boston Public Library. We've an open studio there. Come on down and check it out.
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:41.760]   I believe I'm on at 1130 in the morning this week. But if you check my Twitter on Thursday or
[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:46.720]   Friday morning, I usually have the absolute specifics for you. Excellent. And your left hand,
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:51.600]   pal, there. Alex Lindsey of Pixel Core. Thank you so much. And we appreciate you being here
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:56.160]   with Renee out. Regardless of Renee's here, he's not here. We love to have you. And we think
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:00.880]   I'm glad you're here with us today. It was good to be here. Yeah. It would have been pretty rude if
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:07.280]   you were just here in the other room just reading while we're doing a back break shorthand. So maybe
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:12.240]   you were just sort of obligated to that point. We're just talking, talking about how, what
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:15.920]   guy wish Alex, you know, that you're you're all behind going to the fridge for another school.
[02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:20.960]   Yes. We would have that would have been perfect. Like, oh, he'll insert me, like, putting my head in.
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.520]   Like, while Andy's talking, you just see me just put my head in going.
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:29.760]   Wow. That would be funny. That would have been funny. And anything to pitch or you want to tell
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:35.360]   us how people can get in touch with you? Mostly on the Twitter. And I'm on Instagram as well.
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:40.000]   If you want to see pictures of my trips, usually I'm when I'm traveling, I'm taking pictures and
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:43.600]   throwing them up on Instagram. There's a bunch of stuff from India and Cambodia and stuff like that.
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:49.680]   And then I'm going to put more up there. And then on Twitter, I mostly say whatever I'm going to say.
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:53.840]   And sometimes it's good. Sometimes bad. I just wrote if you go up to Twitter, you'll see a link.
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:58.640]   I just wrote a couple articles, non technical articles about live streaming on medium.
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:05.200]   So if you if you want to check that out, you can find it on medium under me or you can find the
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:10.640]   links directly on Twitter. And it's just my name, Alex Lindsay. Excellent. Coming to us from not
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:16.480]   as warm as Petaluma, California, but still pretty warm Sacramento, California. It's the one and only
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:21.040]   Lori Gill. Lori Gill, thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks again for having me.
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:25.680]   Oh, of course. It is your show, frankly. Thank you for having me. I appreciate it.
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:31.120]   I am the only regular on here right now, aren't I? Wow. You are always
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:36.640]   and I believe I believe I know. And that's what you know, I'm I'm looking at the screen with Alex
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:42.080]   and it's throwing me off. So me and Andy, you're right. The two of us. I find that Lori is often the
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:46.560]   she tends to be the cornerstone on the I'more podcast. There were times when other people were out,
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:52.320]   but Lori was always there. We appreciated that. Lori Gill, if people want to get in touch with
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:57.440]   you online or if you have anything to pitch to us, including don't forget her AirPods Pro article
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:05.680]   comes out soon. Yes. You can find me at apoholic on Twitter. That's a P P A H O L I K. And yeah,
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:09.760]   definitely check out I'm more. We've got all kinds of great things going on. We've got reviews of
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:16.000]   Apple of the TV plus shows that are out. My AirPods review should be up today or tomorrow at the
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:23.680]   latest. You know how it is. Indeed, indeed. If you want to get in touch with me, by the way,
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:27.920]   remember Leo Laport is on vacation right now, probably on a boat or as the chat was saying,
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:33.120]   maybe on a camel, who knows, but I am here in his place until he gets back. You can find me at
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:39.200]   Mikey Sargent on most of the social things, or you can head to chihuahua.coffee, which yes is still
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:44.400]   the link, the place to find all the links to the different things that I do. Well, folks,
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:57.120]   it's time again to say get back to work. This is Mac Break is over.
