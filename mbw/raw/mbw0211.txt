[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.560]   to do with the Apple universe, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.400]   And with us today, of course, as usual from the Chicago Sun
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.000]   Times and the celestial waste of man with Mr. Andy.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.400]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.840]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.280]   That's good to see you again, Andy.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.280]   How's your dude doing?
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.680]   Madu is doing good.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.240]   You would like my madu.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.760]   He's good.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.120]   Exactly.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.120]   Alex couldn't be with us.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.160]   He is in London, Londonium, as they used to call it.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.000]   But we have a great sub who came in at the last moment,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.720]   off the bench, Mr. Adam Inks to the tidbits newsletter.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.880]   Hey, Adam.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.080]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.400]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.320]   tidbits is, of course, the place
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.280]   to go to get the Apple news you really care for.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.600]   If you really want real Apple news, don't listen to this.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.080]   Because we just don't have the time
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.360]   to do all the drama and soap opera stuff.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.040]   All the BS, that's right.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.680]   Now tidbits is a must read, everybody.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.800]   And you've been doing this for more than 10 years,
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.840]   which is amazing.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840]   20 years?
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.840]   20.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   20?
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.240]   I'm not dating myself.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.760]   I know.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.640]   You go to the front page, it says 20 years.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.920]   That's awesome.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.440]   In 8-bit type, no less.

[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.840]   So I'm thrilled that you've been able to make a go with this.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.840]   Latest stories from tidbits this week.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.320]   What's wrong with digital cameras?
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.840]   The fall and open source rise of Google Wave, Autodesk,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.600]   Apple Mail, flawed parental controls, the future of books.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.400]   You see how serious this stuff is?
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   No drama, just facts.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   But now we're going to get the drama.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   They even think that high-asky is a little bit too flashy
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   and distracting to meet the article.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   So, images for tidbits, double hyphens all the way.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   If you haven't yet listened to our coverage of Apple's
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   announcement from last Wednesday, please do.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   It's in the Twitch specials.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   Twitter.tv/specials.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   Also, of course, Mac Break Weekly, immediately after where we
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   talk about it.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   But now we've had almost a week to think about it.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   By the way, I should point out, Google taking a page from the
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.400]   Apple Playbook has a big announcement tomorrow.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   Yep.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   And it's actually right across the street from the
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   Erbord-Wintagarners at the SF MoMA, which made me wonder,
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   it's a search-based event.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Just like Apple, it's one-week notice.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   Just like Apple, they're not saying exactly what they're
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   announcing.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   But from the name of the event and also from the fact that
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   all the personnel are from the search products, we know it's not
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   going to be like a second unveiling of Google TV or anything
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   cool like that.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   It is going to be something related to their search technology.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   It's actually going to be a scavenger hunt.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   [laughter]
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Got to go around and go to Finding the Right Art.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   We don't even have any news.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   We just wanted to see how many of you could afford to come to
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   Sam and Liz go on a week's notice.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   [laughter]
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   We hate all reporters.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   We just wanted to really put through our wait around like that.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   They did say in their defense, it's a search event.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   They've done these before where there really is kind of state
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   of the search, not so much, here's a new product.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   But we are waiting for the other shoot-a-drop and they have
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   said this week, yes, we will do Google music before the end of
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   the year.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   Google TV is still coming on Strong Effect.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   Samsung now is ending.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   They may put Google TV in their boxes along with Sony,
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   Dish, and of course, Logitech.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   And we're still waiting, although Google's never confirmed
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.400]   this for a Facebook killer or clone Google Me.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   So potentially Google could have a lot of announcements,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   but it doesn't sound like it will be tomorrow.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   Won't that be a surprise when it is?
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.400]   Yeah, and plus, that's not really their style to have the big,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   let's rent out this big flashy auditorium and darken the stage
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.400]   and send somebody out in an ascot to really show us or our stuff.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   It's always the Google Developer event that they decide to play
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   most of their cards.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400]   Right.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   At some point, they're going to have to have an event
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   announcing Google music, I would think.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   But it's kind of hard to know exactly when they're going to be
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   pulling the trigger on that.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   One thing we talked about last week was Apple TV and what looked
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   like Apple, you know, the analogy I end up using is a poker
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   analogy that Apple checked to the leader here.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   Instead of saying, "Okay, we're going to put apps on Apple TV,"
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   they kind of held their powder and I think they're waiting to see
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   what Google TV does.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   We know it'll have apps, it's going to be Android based.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   And of course, as we observed last week, there's nothing to keep
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Apple from turning on apps at some point.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   We haven't talked to you, Adam, about this.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   What is your thought on the Apple TV?
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   Well, as Andy knows, I'm kind of a bad Apple TV commentator in some
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   ways because I don't really watch TV.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   That's why you have so much time to write and run and think about that.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   But, you know, the problem in part, we're going to be
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   going to talk about TV.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   Okay, a little TV history.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   So, you know, I grew up when there were three channels.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   And so, you just wasn't anything to watch.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   I didn't grow up anywhere with this cable.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   And so, you know, you watched, there was CBS, ABC and NBC and that
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.400]   was it and, oh, and PBS, which we also got.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   So, the four channels and you just didn't watch much TV because
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   there wasn't much to watch and there wasn't, frankly, that much
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   that was very good and my parents were not big TV people.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   So, you know, what we watched, we watched all as a family and, you
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   know, MASH, Cosby Show, a couple of other things.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   That's about it.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   And so, you know, as I moved, I never got cable.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   And so, it wasn't until 2001 that I actually ever had cable.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   Even when we lived in Seattle, we were in places that didn't have
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   cable.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   And so, we get back to Stithika and, you know, Time Warner says,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   "Hey, you wanted this great digital cable.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   It's, you know, it's going to be cheap.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400]   It's tons of channels, all that.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   Okay, great."
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   So, we get this, we plug in our Tivo or Tivo happily sucking in
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   all this content.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   It's fabulous.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.400]   And then we discover that most of what's on just really sucks.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   And, you know, and so we've got, I mean, you know, the whole, I mean,
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   it's kind of embarrassing that what was it, 57 channels and nothing
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400]   on?
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   I mean, it was way more than 57 channels and nothing on.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   And the things we did like, you know, the Tivo got and held for
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   us and, and it just, I don't know, it just wasn't that much.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   And so at some point we realized we were paying like 80 or 100 bucks
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   a month for this and, and just got sick of it and ditched it
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   entirely and watching, you know, watch the Tivo down, finally
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   cleaned out the Tivo and then subscribed to Netflix for $8.99
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   a month.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   And, you know, Netflix $8.99 particularly with all the streaming
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   stuff they have now keeps us in all the TV we want.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   It's probably true and it's going to be more so.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   And the TV does have Netflix.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   And so, I mean, so, so I actually, honestly, I'm actually
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   pretty happy about the new Apple TV almost purely from the
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   Netflix standpoint because it makes a good streaming thing for,
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   you know, to watch all the stuff that Netflix is putting out in
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   streaming.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   And what I don't quite know yet is it says you'll be able to be
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   able, you'll be able to connect to your computers and watch anything
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   on your computers.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   So if I rip a DVD and I have it on my computer, can I watch it
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   on the Apple TV?
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.400]   But do I have to do some additional conversion?
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   Am I going to basically be manipulating these files into a
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   gazillion different formats?
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   And that's one of the questions I have.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   So, you know, if I have a, if Netflix sends me a DVD, how do I
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.400]   watch that on my Apple TV?
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   You probably don't.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   I would guess.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   But I guess you could.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   You're right.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   If you put it in iTunes, it'll stream something from iTunes.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   And see, again, you know, I'm betraying my TV cluelessness
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   here, but we've never had a DVD player.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   Hook to a TV.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   Okay.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   I'm asking the wrong person, obviously.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   I realize they're $37 at Target, but you know, I have a
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.400]   computer for that.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   So you can even get Dr. Gervago on DVD now.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   It's actually quite a mature platform.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   It would be a mistake for me to ask Adam if he cares that it's
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.400]   only 720p, obviously.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   On your 21 inch Philco, it probably looks just fine.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   The 19 inch Sony actually that we've had since 1990.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   Okay.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   See, I wasn't far off.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   Was it?
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   80% recycled timber.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   No more than 2% old growth.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   We're thinking about powering the whole thing from a bicycle soon.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   Do you think in terms of, I mean, okay, so now you have to do it very abstractly,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   Adam, because you're not the potential customer for this.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   But do you think Google poses a threat?
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   Maybe this is maybe really you are the wrong person to ask, but does
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   Google pose a threat to Apple?
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   You know what?
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   It's interesting about this whole thing.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   And I realize I'm coming at it from an unusual standpoint because what is it?
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   The average American watches four hours of television a day.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   It's going up.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   That's what surprises me.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   I don't know how they're doing that.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   But so it feels to me that one of the problems that Apple is getting into is that
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   Apple really, really wants people to rent TV shows and movies.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.400]   And that's the wrong direction because that's not what people want right now.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   Precisely.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   Well, don't, but it didn't Amazon immediately counter with 99 cent buy.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   So, but it's just simply that there is so much out there that it feels to me like you're
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   going to be competing with free very quickly.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   And I have to believe that Google is going to do whatever they possibly can to get stuff
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   for free.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   Andy, well, I just think that someone someone someone someone told me when we're discussing
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   this a lot of week ago that they their theory is that just like five or six or seven years
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   ago, Apple decided that there's going to be a rule that you don't do something on CD unless
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   you can you don't do something via wired unless you can do it wirelessly.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   That was really brought home with the with the Macbook Air.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   And now there's a new I there's now a new offshoot of that, which is that don't do anything that
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   requires storage unless you can do it from the cloud.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   And there are a lot of different operations in which there's no need to assume that someone
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   really wants to have a 18 gigabyte HD episode of house MD on their hard drive in perpetuity.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   If I had the choice between two ninety nine to have it forever and ninety nine cents means
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.400]   that I watch it.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.400]   I'm done with it.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.400]   And I never it's not clever.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   I don't have my hard drive anymore.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   TV is largely disposable entertainment.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   So I'm going to dip back into it every few months.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   So it's a very very it's a very very interesting application, this idea.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   Now I didn't anticipate that Amazon would drop down their prices to well how about how
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   about nine nine cents and you get to keep it.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.400]   And by the way, you don't even have to store it.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   You can you can watch it anytime.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   It's on your library.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   Well, I should Amazon is large is most seat.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   They don't even do a download service.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   Do they you own it?
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   It's a I don't know.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   I don't know.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   I believe it it believe it just adds to your on demand library permanently.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   I think it's a lot.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.400]   Right.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   So so so we're still dealing with a concept of.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.400]   No one wants to tie up that many gigabytes of HD storage on their hard drive for eight,
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   you know, for last week's, you know, Gilmore Girls, that's even still on.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   That's I don't I don't watch much TV either.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.400]   It's ironic though, because Apple is the company that has said time and time again,
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   people want to own music.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   Now I know music's different than TV and movies, but Apple won't let you rent music,
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   but they insist that you rent TV and movies.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   Is it so different?
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   Don't people want to own stuff?
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   Isn't Apple right about that?
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.400]   I think Danny's right.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   The storage is just insane now.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:49.400]   That, you know, when you start, you know, ripping TV days and downloading shows and whatnot,
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   it just adds up so fast and yes, discs are cheap, but how much time and effort do you want to put
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.400]   into managing this library that just from, I mean, from a, I mean, from a,
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   almost from a technical standpoint, I'm certainly offended by it all because it's the same
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   bits everywhere.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.400]   Why should everyone have who owns a copy of this have the same bits?
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.400]   We have enough bandwidth to move this stuff around really, really easily at this point.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.400]   And so, I mean, what I like, I mean, I'm not bothered by Apple sort of wanting to rent
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   stuff for 99 cents, but it really feels to me like, you know, almost the Netflix model
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   of, you know, a nine bucks a month or whatever, for all you can eat,
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.400]   streamed, whatever you want, whatever you want.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   That's going to be, you know, that's hard to beat.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   It's interesting though.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   Again, I'll throw in another monkey wrench.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   You're transferring the cost of storage from the consumer to yourself.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   Apple now has to stream and store this.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   If I watch the same show four times, that's four times the bandwidth of a download.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   And I mean, storage, okay, that's too minimalist because you're storing it anyway.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   You're really going to watch the same show four times?
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.400]   Well, some people will.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   I mean, I don't want some say show first.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.400]   Isn't that, but that's potentially costly.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   I mean, if you download it once and you store it, then the consumer is eating the cost of watching it.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   Well, I think the real feature is just for the consumer point of view,
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   removing the problem of finding where this thing is stored and connecting to that.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   I have probably four copies of the Godfather around this house between physical and digital copies.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   And yet when I needed something to, something cool to watch while I was cooking on Sunday,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.400]   the idea that I can just simply tap three buttons and get it on Netflix on my iPad,
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   Netflix was the place I wind up getting it from because it's the simplest place to go and find it.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   So maybe that's the feature.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.400]   And by the way, we know people watch video over and over.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   Otherwise, you wouldn't seek YouTube video counts in the tens of millions.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   Somebody's watching it more than once.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   I think anything it does depend a little on the thing.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   My wife watched dick in a box like 80 times.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   I don't know why.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.400]   Shut up.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   Hey, have a show title.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   Just don't touch it.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   Please.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   And we have another two titles.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.400]   All right, I'm going to move on here.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.400]   Let's move on.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   I think it's an interesting subject.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.400]   And clearly, Apple has put a stake in the ground for simplicity versus complexity.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.400]   And I think they're saying maybe it isn't a pure check.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   Maybe they're saying, we're going to opt for simplicity, watch Google through the complex thing
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   just as what they're doing on the phones and we'll see who wins.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   Well, here's the thing though.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   A lot of people do have those cable connections.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   They have this stuff.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.400]   They pay in some amount for the big pipe of all they can eat.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   And they want to be able to extract stuff from that.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.400]   And that's I think what people are complaining about with the Apple TV is like, well, you
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   know, I already have cable.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.400]   Why aren't you helping me do something along making you know getting that?
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   And I mean, it's the people who want Tivo to be built into the Apple TV.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.400]   And that does change matters because then you've got storage.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   It's bigger.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   It's hotter.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   And that's what Microsoft is doing.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   That's the Microsoft solution is basically a Tivo.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   But see, here's what Apple, and I don't know enough about what Google Google's doing, but
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:07.280]   imagine that you could pay someone else sort of like the way I pay Netflix and get that
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:13.400]   full cable feed into or you're a stream to your Apple TV whenever you wanted, whatever
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   you wanted, you know, on demand.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.120]   Well, that was kind of my thinking when if you put apps, if you put apps in there, you
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.480]   could have an HBO app.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.400]   You could have a Showtime app.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.120]   You know, you could, you could do all you could have.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   You'd probably have an MTV app.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.080]   And in fact, it'd be an MTV's interest because they'd make a richer app that had much more
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.280]   engagement and interactivity than just watching MTV on a TV.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.680]   Oh, I mean, if it's an app, you could Apple can put iPads in it.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.800]   And Apple could Apple makes money because they're going to get 30% of any subscription fees.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.960]   And yes, they can monetize with ads.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.720]   So it seems like it's an Apple's interest to do apps ultimately.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:51.560]   I suspect that the pundits who say, well, and maybe it was you Andy who said that last
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.080]   week, maybe there's no apps now, but there's nothing to keep them.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.880]   It's clearly an iOS based device has got a name for it.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.240]   I think the over under on how many days you have to wait until somebody jail breaks the
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   Apple TV.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.440]   I'm betting less than a week.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.960]   My money's on four days.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   Yes.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.720]   Because you assume that as soon as people get that box, that's what they're doing.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.240]   Well, they may be getting it soon.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.000]   I just got my shipping notice that my iPod nano is coming.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.480]   I lounge has already done an unboxing on there.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.760]   The new iPod shuffle.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   So they are shipping.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.880]   Apparently iPod touches are also shipping.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.920]   I haven't seen any word about people's I teabor Apple TVs coming out, but it may not be too
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   much longer.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.640]   When do they say the Apple TV would be available next month?
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.120]   And the next month, that's the end of next month.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.120]   Four weeks.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   So my new wristwatch is on its way.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.000]   You know, how come Apple's never put something on a wristwatch?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.400]   It is a wristwatch.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   It's got a clock face.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.200]   I'm going to clip it to my.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   I'm not going to wear a band.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   I'm just going to clip it somewhere.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.200]   Now you're a runner.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.920]   Are you excited about the new nano?
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.960]   I have to admit, I run with people.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   So you know, I run with people.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.640]   Yeah, the carbon-voiced life form thing.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.640]   That's weird.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.280]   People let you down.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.640]   It's a very analog technology.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.440]   And I'll fight you right in the ass.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.800]   I'm going to do it by doing the ass.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.640]   Do you use the Nike thing?
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.640]   Use the Nike thing, Adam?
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.120]   Because I know there's a Nike GPS app in the.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.640]   I do not use the Nike thing.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.000]   When I tested it back early when it came out, it simply wasn't accurate enough.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.880]   But you know, if there's nothing that makes a runner more and more irritated, it's being
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.680]   given statistics that are wrong.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.240]   I think the new one, because it's using the phone's GPS, will be much better.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.560]   My experience with tracking on the Android has been.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   GPS is good.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.480]   Yeah, I use a Garmin 4Runner 305, which is a GPS watch.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.000]   Oh, look, it's right here.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   It's honking huge.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.160]   It is pretty big.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.120]   But on the other hand, you want it to be big so you can read it while you're going.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.160]   I mean, you need to be able to see what you're doing.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.960]   And it's got all sorts of cool features.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.520]   You can have it automatically tell you what the last mile was.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.200]   You can actually have it yell at you if you're not running fast enough or if you're running
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.160]   too fast, that kind of thing.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.240]   That's something I don't hear a lot.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.080]   You're running too fast.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.640]   Slow down, Leo.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640]   I don't hear that either.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.200]   I actually had it yell at me to make me speed up in a race yesterday.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.560]   It didn't actually work.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   It was nice.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.560]   I finished it.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.360]   I wasn't running fast enough the whole way.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.400]   They need to program it with your mom's voice.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.120]   Adam, Adam, run faster, Adam.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.200]   I didn't finish as high in the rankings as I hoped I would.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.360]   I think that has largely to do with the time that I spent in running the course.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   Yeah, I did it.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   Me too.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   I did it back then.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.360]   Look at that.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.360]   Pie face.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.080]   He's got a pie face.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.080]   Amazing.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.360]   We've got Adam Anks here from tidbits Andy Enoco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   Leo Laport here.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.160]   Andy, one of these days I'd love to see if we can get Roger Ebert on the show.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.040]   Your coworker at the Sun Times.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.080]   I'll talk to him about it.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.640]   When I was in Chicago, I spent about three, four hours at house at a good time.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.640]   Oh, man.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.640]   His new synthesizers.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.640]   I was listening to it.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.640]   Sounds just like him.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.720]   He could do this show.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.200]   He could do this show while blogging and tweeting at the same time.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.840]   Doing it during all three so that we'd be working at UPS the next day voluntarily.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.040]   We're going to take a break and talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.400]   If you are going to meetings by flying or driving, man, man, you're spending a lot of
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.480]   money on travel unnecessarily worse.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.600]   If you're in a conference call, you just, you just killing yourself that boredom, the
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.800]   crossed eyes you can tell.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.360]   And if you're leading the conference call, you know when it gets real quiet, they're
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:47.000]   off to an email playing video games, farmville, doing anything, combing their beards, anything
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.560]   but paying attention.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.200]   And that's why I, well done, Andy.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   We timed that out perfectly.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.000]   That's why I recommend go to meeting.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.240]   Go to meeting takes those conference calls, makes them engaging, exciting because they're
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.240]   visual suddenly.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.640]   It's very easy to install and set up.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.040]   You could do it on a Mac or PC.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.320]   Yes, it works with Windows.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.680]   If you go to go to meeting.com/macbreak, you'll have install before I'm done talking.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.440]   Actually, it's not saying much since I pretty much talk all day.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:21.840]   But let's say soon, in minutes, maybe seconds, very quick to install.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   And now you're ready.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   Next time you're going to have a meeting, you could do it ahead of time by sending out
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.600]   an invitation or on the fly.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.680]   You tell your, you know, your board conferees, stop combing your beard and go to go to meeting.com.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   Here's a meeting ID there.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.200]   And now they're seeing their computer on their screen.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.360]   Even if they haven't had it installed because it's very quick, they have to download a little
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360]   tiny stub.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.600]   I think it's 40K or something.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.000]   And boom, boom, they're seeing your screen.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.680]   Not only that, they can show you their screen if you want.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.240]   You could collaborate together on documents.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.720]   Show them the PowerPoint, the keynote, the spreadsheets, work together on, you know,
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.880]   a document.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.720]   I've rehearsed speeches this way.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   It's just amazing.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.720]   You'll save time.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.200]   It'll be more productive, more focused.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   Your audience will be more engaged.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.800]   I want you to try it right now, absolutely free.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   Donamining.com/MacBreak.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.240]   We thank Citrix so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:18.520]   By the way, I should have mentioned this, the iPad app is really fantastic.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.360]   Uses the microphone and the speakers on the iPad.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.520]   So you don't even need a phone.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:32.640]   Moving along, let's talk about, I see you have a machine that goes, the new social network
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.720]   that ain't so very social.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.440]   So when Steve showed it on stage, he showed Facebook Connect and showed, you know, you
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.640]   could search your Facebook friends for other ping members.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.640]   It might have even been a two-way street.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.920]   Cara Swisher in All Things D says, well, here's what happened.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.720]   Facebook does have an API to make that kind of data available.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.320]   And if you're a small player, you can use it for free without notifying Facebook.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.960]   If you're a big player, let's say you have, I don't know, 160 million card-carrying members,
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.000]   Facebook consists of negotiating.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.240]   You have to make a deal.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:14.000]   Steve Jobs, kind of in an offhand comment to Cara after the event, said the deal was
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   not a good deal.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.320]   It was onerous what Facebook was asking.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.680]   So without any notice, without saying anything, Apple turned off Facebook Connect and it's
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   not back on yet.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:28.640]   So ping is basically a social network that connects to only ping.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.840]   Is that a liability, Andy?
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.800]   I would say so because you really want to tap into it.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.720]   People have not really developed any friendships on ping yet in the past week.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.960]   All their friends are on Facebook and are on Twitter.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.040]   Anytime you're trying to start any feature with social features, if you can start off
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.320]   by bringing in all the friends and all the relationships you've already defined, you
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.680]   are 30 to 40% along your way.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.440]   I think ping is going to be a very different thing if it cannot hook up to Twitter or Facebook.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.160]   One problem I've had with ping is that I have more than one person.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.360]   And others have reported this using my account.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.720]   Chief, the guy who buys most of the music on my account is my son.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   He loves the rap.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.920]   He loves the rap music.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.120]   So I'm listening to your recommendations and I'm thinking, you know what?
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.040]   Even if Leo's just buying these to work out with, that's a real pro double plus cardio
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   workout.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:25.240]   Well, if you look closely, you'd see that on my profile, I say I like classical music.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.120]   Using a songwriter music, you know, Jazzy and spoken word.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:39.560]   But if you listen to the songs I buy on ping.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.280]   And notice, by the way, Robert comments on this purchase.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.920]   Leo, are you trying to be funny?
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.120]   No, it's my son.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   It's my son.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.160]   That's AKA the I just got divorced after 23 year marriage.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.560]   But I'm really about to get right back into the game.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.560]   Play.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.120]   I am a player.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120]   That's what the balls for.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.120]   Just get down.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.120]   Get down.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.120]   Get funky.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.800]   You see, that's why I'm still a big wheel at the ad agency.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.280]   I can speak to the youth.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   I speak their language.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.440]   I never got old up here.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.480]   Never got old up here.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   The youth of America.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.960]   With this stuff in my beard, it looks so natural.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.120]   No one can tell.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.360]   It's just like what the box says.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.640]   What I feel bad for is the 3,000 27 people who are following me.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.680]   Because they're obviously much confused.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:32.480]   So, you know, I've been doing ping for the same week that everyone else has.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.720]   And I have to admit, I almost don't get it.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.560]   I don't either.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:44.280]   It seems like, Paul can't sit on Twitter earlier today, that it seemed like the whole
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.080]   goal was to help Apple sell music.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.240]   And I'm sure Apple wants that.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.360]   But frankly, I don't give a damn.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.360]   Right.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:59.200]   You know, if I want to say, if I'm playing a song, any iTunes while I'm working, and
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.480]   I sort of want to say, this is a cool song, I'd like to tell my friends about this.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.920]   First of all, it's hard to do.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.520]   You can't do it from what's playing.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.840]   You have to somehow find the song on the iTunes Store, assuming it's even in the iTunes
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.160]   Store.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.040]   And then you have to, you know, do a post.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.560]   It's a little tricky to do for a song, it's a little easier for an album.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.040]   And then, you know, people can't, they can only listen to the 30 second preview.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.760]   So it's not like you're saying to your friends, you know, hey, this is great song, you gotta
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.760]   hear this.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.520]   Because that's what you do with music.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.560]   You say, you gotta hear this, and then you play it for them.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.920]   Well, it does have 30 seconds to say, go buy it.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.880]   It does have two big wins.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.480]   Number one is just the ability to look into the sidebar there and get a top 10 list of
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:46.960]   recommendations that are sort of this is the top, the billboard top 10 amongst your friends.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.480]   And oftentimes, at least a really good discovery.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.680]   I mean, it's worth, it's actually worth my while to hit these samples and just listen
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.280]   to music that people in my social circle are listening to because that's why I'm listening
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.280]   to E40's my ghetto report card.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.480]   You are so hoe is late.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.040]   Well, that's it.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   Well, that's it.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.080]   Macbreak says we should do what to the pigs, Lee?
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.400]   It seems they provide vital community services.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.480]   As some have pointed out, I can take, turn this off in the settings.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:23.760]   But the way I turn it off is by saying, don't display music that I like or manually manually
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.760]   pick that solution.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.640]   No, there's just be a frank for I only bought this ironically.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.440]   I just wanted to make fun of my sister who listens to a lot of ABBA and wanted to play it
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.360]   at maximum volume to annoy her.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.240]   I don't really like ABBA.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.920]   Well, actually, that raises a good point.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.960]   You could punk people too with this.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.520]   So let's put some ABBA in there and weird out.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:53.400]   And so now I can add all sorts of weird stuff to my list that I didn't even really buy.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.160]   Well, not hear weird out denigrated.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.560]   No, I love weird out.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.920]   Although he tweeted just yesterday that the new iTunes is sorting all of his stuff to
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.080]   come up under W now instead of Y.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.920]   Yeah, what did I rename myself, Wankovich?
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.360]   Which isn't a bad idea.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.240]   I thought that was kind of possible.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.320]   The first time that I was trying to organize people that I know, I'm like, really, you're
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.440]   alphabetizing by first name.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   OK, well, I've taught a class in basic programming.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.520]   That's usually something we cover by the second or third class.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.240]   That's why we create a first name field and a last name field.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.600]   That way we can sort on the last name field.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.480]   You know, that's where it's done.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:40.480]   OK, I just have to say something here because when you go and you say, Oh, look, here's
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.720]   Sean King.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.680]   Let's see who's following Sean.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.760]   And so you see all it sorts it chronologically.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.200]   Oh, wait, no, I take it back.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   There's pop.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.200]   Oh, I take it.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.040]   I'm criticizing and there is indeed a sort by because it sorts by most recent.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.240]   It was one of those things was like, I couldn't care less what the order these people started.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.840]   You want to see what he likes?
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.440]   And then the final Apple did add a sort A to Z and Z to A. So now you can, in fact, at
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.200]   least sort of course by first name.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:14.240]   I will say so say, though, that although I'm not I'm not a huge social networking fan,
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.000]   I use Facebook like maybe once a week just to keep things tidy.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.640]   It is kind of interesting to have a constant stream of people have conversations about
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.480]   music because music is one of those topics that you can have long conversations with
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.320]   with just about anybody.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.920]   And so I did find myself the first couple of days actually kind of tabbing in just to
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.120]   see what people were talking about.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.400]   The conversation about XTC turned into conversation about radius that more into rock stations
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.480]   like WBC and back in Boston.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.040]   So I kind of enjoy that.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.240]   It's an interesting fuel to have to power a social network on.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.640]   And the fact that you're keeping it all within the music library app that you're going to
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.880]   be in to purchase and listen to your music, that makes a little bit more convenient than
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.200]   simply saying, I'm going to have a Twitter button that will take this take me out of
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.720]   here and it's my Twitter client.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.360]   But there's no way that Twitter can really integrate tightly into this other music player.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.200]   You know who would be good?
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.880]   What could do this better though is Facebook with a buy link because what I don't want
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.960]   it to be is just the music.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.160]   I want to have other conversations as well.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.480]   And it's you have to live in iTunes to do this, right?
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.240]   Do we really need to have a third huge social network now?
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.480]   Right now we have Facebook for the sort of private version of the web.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.040]   We have Twitter for micro conversations.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.680]   Doesn't that really cover everything?
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:34.520]   Wouldn't somebody have to totally up end the entire paradigm, just come up with a total
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.120]   new way of developing a social network that hasn't been thought of yet?
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.720]   We can call it my space.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   Wow.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   I think friends.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   I think that domain is available now.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.480]   Because really this is who if anybody gets disenfranchised by this, it's my space.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.120]   My space is getting hammered by this because I mean artists, let's face it, they're going
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.840]   to want to be in iTunes because that's where the buy links are.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.800]   I was a little disappointed because I searched for many of the artists I like and I could
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.640]   not find a lot of them.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.640]   Maybe that's got better.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.640]   I have to.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.120]   It's one of those things that Apple simply needs to do a lot more evangelism to the music
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   community.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.440]   I suppose the music community should do.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.440]   I mean, why not?
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.960]   You know, I mean, this is just a simple note.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.280]   Brainerd is just is to have at least a page so people can follow you.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.680]   See, here's the thing that I wonder.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:24.400]   I know this is basically what Andy was saying earlier, which is this feels to me a little
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.000]   like Apple putting a toe in the water.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.360]   If they can figure out in this real sandbox of topic, you know, it's all about music,
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.800]   you've got to be at iTunes, you can't do much of anything.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   They can, you know, you don't have to worry about, you know, spammers.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.320]   They don't have to let people sign up.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.680]   Any of that kind of stuff does this let them figure out what they want to do for a social
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.560]   network that then becomes more general and does attempt to take on Facebook and Twitter.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.080]   I don't think Apple's going to do that.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   Andy, you think they want to do that?
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.080]   I don't think so.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.480]   I think it's I think it's as simple as the fact that they realize that people have to
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.800]   leave the iTunes app to do something that seems to be very popular.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.200]   They would much they don't want to come to those clicks.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.160]   They just want to make sure that it's a more integrated experience.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.680]   I think that's really the reason why they added this.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   That makes sense.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.480]   And the top and things like the top 10 list makes it a lot easier to sell tracks.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:23.960]   I spent the good news for Apple is that I spent about seven to eight dollars on new music
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.440]   within the first hour of using ping.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.400]   But the bad news is that for the two hours after that, I tapped over to Amazon MP3 and
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.480]   bought them by MP3 as usual.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.680]   So for discovery, it was working just absolutely awesome.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.600]   We'll get Alex Lindsey on next week when he comes back because he believes that he actually
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.960]   blogged ping.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.160]   It's the end of the music industry and I feel fine.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.480]   He really believes that.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.160]   But there's something missing here which is unlike my space where independent artists
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.120]   really could blossom and grow and build an audience, it's not easy for an independent
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.120]   artist or is it to be part of this of ping?
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.520]   Don't you have to be a signed artist or could anybody do it?
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.520]   I don't know.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.200]   Well, a lot of iTunes gets a lot of its independent music via CD Baby.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.560]   So I don't know in those kind of aggregators.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.680]   I don't know what the trick will be for those kind of people to get in.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:16.720]   But if Apple's smart, they'll make people make it easy for people to pop in.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.320]   There's no interest though, I'm sure in Apple's part, unless you can buy it on iTunes.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:27.000]   Although the beat, I am a fan of the Beatles on this actually.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   So there.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   But did they finally show up?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.040]   Because when I looked and I tried to search on the Beatles, it was all the only connections
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.680]   were, oh no, is when I was doing music I liked.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.080]   Yeah, you can't do that.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.480]   I put a Beatles, it was like all this weird, you know, fan stuff.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:48.400]   It's a tribute to the Beatles, the born-angen Beatles, whoever that is.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.200]   But yeah, but you can follow them.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:56.360]   So somebody, EMI, I guess, has actually created a Beatles fan page.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.440]   So I guess you could, any arbitrary fan pages are possible.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.560]   If you're a label, I guess, I don't know what the deal is.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.800]   Well, and here's the thing, how come no podcasters?
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.080]   Podcasters could have fan pages.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.520]   Because as everyone knows, podcasting is amateur hour.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.520]   Oh, sorry.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.440]   And it's not the same thing.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.440]   It's not.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.440]   I'll be honest.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:21.240]   I'm glad because the last thing I need is one more social network to maintain for our
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.200]   fans, you know.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.680]   If I were selling maybe.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.040]   I mean, my flight, it was a really busy trip.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.120]   I, as a matter of fact, when I got back home to landed at Logan, I had to set up a shop
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:38.040]   inside the terminal and spend another 90 minutes writing and filing columns and stuff.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.600]   And then I was ready to go home, but I thought, yeah, but you downloaded iTunes 10 last night.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   The download did not work.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.560]   So you weren't able to visit Ping.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.920]   What are the chances that someone is going to grab a not go as their name?
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.120]   And then you'll have to be the real a not go, which is the ultimate sign of being behind
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.720]   the curve in sort of.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.320]   I think it's, I think that a lot of people are going to get into this just because they
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.320]   don't want to miss the boat on something.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.760]   But I think that's going to be kind of a sedate.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.880]   Just just another part of the iTunes experience in two or three months, it'll be such a colossal
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.200]   victory for Apple.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.520]   If this turns out to be anything more anything on the level of even my space, the way that
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.320]   they are right now, even the current edition of my space, it would be just such a huge
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.200]   win that I don't think we can predict that.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.920]   So when I search on the Beatles, I find the Beatles, the unofficial page for the Beatles.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.720]   Obviously there would never be a official pick page for the Beatles.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.720]   Okay.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.360]   Ah, sorry.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.800]   So you can't create an official pay.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.440]   Who can do that though?
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.440]   Now I'm not going to be.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.360]   I'm a little curious about this because Apple says you have to have, you know, you have
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.040]   to have an iTunes account with a credit card.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.400]   And I know there's been some comments spam too.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.600]   Big problems with spamming haven't there been?
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.960]   Yeah, but that's got to come from people with iTunes accounts.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   You'd think that Apple'd be slapping those people silly.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   Well, I'm sure they do.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   We're charging them for it.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.120]   It's like whack them all though.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.840]   I mean, it's easy to create.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.120]   But it's not that easy because you have to have a credit card.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.120]   Good Apple, I do want to raise this one issue.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.840]   Paul Therrot, our Windows guy, says, and I think I agree that iTunes really is not a
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.680]   great program and really deserves to be rewritten.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:16.200]   It seemed to me, if you're going to call it number 10, you deserve something a little
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.640]   more than a new way of looking at albums and paying.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.440]   Well you got grayscale on the sidebar.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.080]   You take the color out of the icons.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   Ooh.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.640]   And you see they stack the little clothes minimizing and expand zoom buttons.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.440]   That's got to be a paid version number.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.720]   See, to me, it's 9.5 or something.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.040]   I don't know if they'll.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.760]   They also, it is just little enhancements.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.360]   One of the things I really liked was when you sync your iPhone or your iPad, it's now
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.680]   much more verbose on what the process is, how many steps along it isn't exactly what
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.680]   it's doing.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:51.080]   So you don't just get the sort of anonymous barber poll of destiny.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.080]   Back it.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.800]   I mean, it is interesting though.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:00.560]   You know that the draining of the color in the sidebar was the result of a lot of meetings
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.720]   and a lot of things written on whiteboards, a lot of Chinese food being thrown across
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.040]   the conference room.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.840]   And you know it came down to the idea, an idea that started off with aperture that said
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.040]   the color apple logo in the corner is distracting.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.720]   We don't want the photographer's eye.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.560]   The photographer with discerning taste who does not want, the color should all be inside
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.760]   the imagery inside the photograph.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.800]   Just for this one application, we're going to take the color off the apple logo.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.280]   And soon enough, that was it for every single part of the of the OS experience.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.960]   Maybe this is part of a new trend where they're trying to discuss that they are starting
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.600]   to regard color in the sidebar as a distraction from a content area.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.280]   And you know that it's a philosophical question and not just an aesthetic one.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   Right.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:47.800]   Well, one of the problems that people are getting is that all of these apps, because Apple encourages
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.320]   it, of course, all of these apps, you know, they look similar.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.320]   They have the same colors.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.920]   They have the same sidebars.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.840]   It's actually getting a little difficult to figure out which app you're in sometimes
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.440]   at first glance, because they look so darn similar.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.720]   And you know, I'm all for interface consistency, but you know, you do need some way of telling
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   the difference.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.360]   I mean, you look over in your side in your dock, for instance, and you know, you've got
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:15.920]   eye chat and Skype and iTunes and they're all these kind of round, round blue circles.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.720]   So, you know, of course, look at Adobe though.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.360]   I mean, Adobe doesn't even, it's almost as if they think an icon doesn't matter.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.080]   They put a box with letters in it.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.920]   I mean, it's like the worst icons in the world.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.400]   And this is the most expensive program on my system.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.440]   They're essentially running a virtual machine and every single thing they do in the Macintosh.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.680]   They don't even really count.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.080]   But my, I was surprised by the move with iTunes because I think that sort of breaks some of
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.080]   the language of the UI.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.720]   The first time I launched it, I thought, oh, okay, well, clearly all these features are
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.160]   now just all these all these playlists are disabled.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.520]   But as soon as it finishes loading in, then I'll be able to actually click on them and
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   activate them.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.520]   They're gray.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.520]   Everything's gray.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.520]   How do I know which is anyway?
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.240]   It's just an odd thing and to have to spend time in Chinese food on, I don't understand
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   it.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.520]   So that we're going to see they spent lots of time in Chinese food.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.520]   And then Steve walked in and said, this is stupid.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.820]   Take out the color.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.320]   That's probably maybe that is.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   No.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.320]   So I think what might have happened because it's so easy to plan to like this, this idea
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.160]   of how things work inside Apple.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.680]   That someone like screwed up with the code and they used the wrong text view that was
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   a totally desaturated view.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:27.000]   And unfortunately, the wrong screenshot got passed around and like Steve signed off on
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   it.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   It's like great work.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.440]   Then suddenly everybody's on the, okay, well, what if we take the color out of the
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.600]   dock icons to OS 10.7 is it's all gray.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   We'll go right.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:43.040]   We'll go right back to like the Mac 128, just one bit graphics fast, sophisticated.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.440]   We can now build a 27 inch tablet because we don't have to worry about the color space
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.440]   anymore.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.440]   You like for big play.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.440]   You like snow leopard?
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.840]   Wait till you see volcanic ash leopard.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.360]   All right.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.800]   Let's say boy, let's let's move on.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.200]   Other news in the Apple.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.760]   Oh, wait, I have to download the new eye to.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.000]   Can you not down if you don't, if you don't, if you're listening to us and say, oh, I want
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.320]   to stay with nine.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.320]   Can you stay with nine?
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   Yep.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   For how long though?
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.760]   Until until you need the next next iOS device.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.840]   It requires iTunes 10 for sinking.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.640]   So some point you're going to have to make a move at some point.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.000]   You're certainly going to have to do that.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   I've kept, I've kept iTunes nine on all, but all, but my main MacBook chiefly because
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.240]   I just have no compelling reason to upgrade it yet.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:31.320]   I'm sure I will at some point, but parental controls in OS 10 can easily be bypassed by
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   anyone.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.880]   Kids, kids, you might not want to listen to this.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.520]   Not appropriate for children under.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.400]   Oh, look, there's still porn on daddy's computer.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.400]   Quick.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:47.680]   Meanwhile, anyone who knows the email address of the child and his or her parent, you could
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.800]   fool the male client into adding any address to the child's whitelist.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.160]   As if the parent had approved the address without his or her knowledge or consent.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.960]   This vulnerability can be taken advantage of by a child.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.520]   So if you say, uh, you're not going to get any more email from that girl, the kid says,
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.520]   yeah, right?
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.120]   Or by any third party.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.040]   And this is what's scary anywhere on the internet.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:19.080]   Uh, this, uh, comes from, uh, caemans.us and, uh, he says, I notified Apple about this
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.000]   vulnerability in July.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.800]   Apple claimed that parental controls are only intended for young children.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.560]   Well, that's, that's, that's realistic.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.920]   I mean, any parents who, parent who thinks that any parent who has to have a job and pay
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.400]   a mortgage and keep a house running and thinks that they have enough free time to keep up
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.320]   with their kids knowledge of technology, it's a bad mojo.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   Yeah, I do.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.000]   I tell when I talk to parents about that, I say, look, you know, you can keep, you can
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.080]   protect your kids up to about the age of 10.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:50.920]   But as soon as they become sophisticated about technology, they're going to get around anything
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.920]   you do.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   If, if only just to go to their neighbor's house and say, Hey, can I, can I use your
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.080]   computer for a minute?
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.920]   Um, let's take a break.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.920]   Let's see what else.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:07.320]   Is there anything else we want to urgent that we'd like to talk about before we come back
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.320]   to you?
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:14.040]   Did you see this story at $673,000 if you were going to buy every app on the apples, iTunes
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:19.720]   store, according to 148 app stuff is, that's all just 673,000.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.000]   That's a lot of farting.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   That's true.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.360]   You can take a couple of long, long weekend.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:30.560]   What does it, you can, you can have, you know, up to eight home screens, but you can
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.560]   actually have a lot more.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   A folders.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.560]   You could do that.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.960]   I think 10, 10 or 11 home screens and you now have folders, right?
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.560]   So that's, that's interesting.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.600]   When I, right now I'm sort of looking at Android tablets that are becoming, going to be coming
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.320]   out the next few months.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.280]   And I'm starting to really feel as though the difference in size between these two app
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.960]   stores is not going to potentially is not that all that significant.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.760]   When you consider that people just want to see there, there may be eight or nine specific
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   apps they want to see and they want to have a selection of those eight or nine specific
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.760]   apps.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.040]   There's going to be maybe another dozen, maybe no, the two dozen that they'll discover and
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   enjoy.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.600]   And the rest of them may not even matter.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.560]   You don't need that wide genetic diversity of application types to have a successful
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560]   app store.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.000]   You just need a great tech editor, great media players, great navigation systems.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.840]   As long as you got those covers, as long as you can grease those, those rails, get enough
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.480]   people, people's hands in the till and make sure that they're making good games to your
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.120]   device, you're really off and running.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.120]   I think it's really almost.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.120]   Some ways brands.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.720]   Some ways this was the, this was the Mac, the, the lesson of the Mac.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.560]   I mean, Mac never had as many apps as Windows, but it didn't matter because the important
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   ones were there.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.760]   What's different here, I think is it is, it's, it's also brands.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.120]   You got to have Evernote, you got to have Pandora.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.880]   You got to have, you know, the things that people expect on a phone, you have to have
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.680]   a way to read office documents, you know, have office to go or something like that.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.360]   And I would say Android's got that, those, those pretty well covered.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.920]   And that's not because Google's doing any outreach particularly.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.280]   It's because the brands are saying, well, this is a platform we need to be on.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   And it's obvious.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.480]   I mean, you know, this isn't, it isn't rocket science.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:03.240]   You know, the, the, the niches that need to be filled are pretty darn clear.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.160]   And it doesn't, it's not that hard to write for Android.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.480]   It's not that hard to write for the iPhone.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.280]   So people are going to fill the niches pretty quickly.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   And after that, it's hard to break in.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.760]   You know, I mean, I've talked to lots of iPhone developers, you know, app developers
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.640]   who, you know, even some who were very successful early on, who are now saying, you know, it's
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.600]   just harder and harder to make a buck there because the big things are what everyone gets.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   And it's hard to be found.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.600]   All the oceanfront property has already been sold.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.960]   And now you got to keep moving further and further inland with every succeeding gear to
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   have a success.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.760]   But if that's what you're looking for, it's probably too late on Android as well.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.560]   I mean, there's, you know, I don't know, tens of thousands of apps enough now that it's
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.560]   not oceanfront.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:48.880]   It might be like one of those Darwinian motions that really favors the small developer rather,
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.240]   the small developer with a small idea rather than the big house with the big idea.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:58.680]   Because if you can, if you can pursue and prosecute an idea with passion and write it
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:04.200]   in your own free time so that you're not necessarily investing five, 10, 20, 30, $100,000
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.560]   in development of the app and then simply decide that any money that I make off of this
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.800]   app is found money.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   You have an advantage because if you are a real software company and you're basically
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.560]   budgeting out how much it's going to cost you to develop this app and you figured out
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:22.760]   that you cannot possibly sell this app for less than $10 and hope to clear profit.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.040]   But your utility does nothing more.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.720]   Your app does nothing more than, you know, pull a print server and tell you what documents
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.720]   are in the queue.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.080]   No one's going to spend 10 bucks for that single purpose app.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.120]   You know, so what about gaming?
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   What about gaming?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.360]   We're seeing, we're seeing, we're seeing Android games now, but still gaming Apple still has
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.520]   seems to have the upper hand on that.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.840]   Yeah, because of consistency of platforms, much easier to not only consistent, it's chiefly
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.600]   consistency of platform where you basically build it once you can deploy it on every single
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.960]   iPhone device, whereas Android is still there.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.040]   If you've got 80% of the code, you've only got 20% of your project because the rest of
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.240]   your time is going to be spent fine tuning.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.880]   Okay, I've got a droid, but not a droid X, a droid X, but a droid incredible.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.200]   Now there's a Samsung that I have to deal with and they're using different chipsets and
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.400]   different hardware that be optimized for each one.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.000]   And now there's still and can you trust each one of these different Android marketplace
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.440]   apps to simply tell the difference between we're going to funnel you to I can sense you
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:24.880]   have a Samsung phone, we're going to make sure that you never get to see anything that will
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.680]   not run properly on your phone.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.680]   That would be nice.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.680]   That's something you really do need.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.640]   I mean, it says it in the comments.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.600]   Now what about what about this?
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:38.120]   According to a fortune dot CNN dot com, Steve Jobs played a little fast and loose with the
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.520]   numbers at the event.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   You know, he claimed that the iPod touches the number one portable game player in the
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:49.800]   world and some journalists said, well, wait a minute, let's take a look at the sales numbers.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:57.640]   As of January, Nintendo has sold 125 million, Nintendo alone, 125 million DS systems.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.480]   Sony sold a hundred six, I'm sorry, 62 million PSPs.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:08.760]   So even if every iOS device that Apple claims have sold 120 million, where iPod touches,
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.680]   you wouldn't even be coming close to being the most popular gaming platform.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:17.960]   So the only, the only way the claim could be true is if you only took a look, and this
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.000]   is Harry McCracken writing and technology, technologizer, if you only took a look at
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.960]   last quarter.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.960]   Right.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.360]   And maybe it's how you slice and dice.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   It's how you slice and dice.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.520]   And since Apple doesn't reveal iPod touch sales, we don't even know.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.880]   Apple could assert really whatever, whatever it wants.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.600]   But the only thing that could be conceivably be true would be just for the last quarter
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.600]   alone.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:46.720]   So is, why would Steve say something that is so kind of blatantly fudging the numbers?
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.000]   Is he trying to convince developers?
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.480]   This is a good game platform that they should be developing for this instead of the DS.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:48:00.080]   I don't have a sense of the portable gaming market, but are there that many games for
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:05.240]   the DS and, and I'm sure there's not even, I'm sure there's not close to the number of
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   games.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.240]   Maybe that's what it is.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   Right.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.000]   And so it doesn't feel that, but because there's not that many games, it doesn't feel
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.520]   like developers are the target for them.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:18.720]   So they're trying to convince moms who are buying games for their kids.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.720]   Or moms were looking at buying a device that's going to have a lot of games because I mean,
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:27.040]   there is, if you're, if you're a parent buying something for your kid, the last thing you
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.040]   want to have is say, Oh, sorry.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.280]   Those five games, that's it.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   I'm dumb.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.200]   You know, I'm, I'm interested now.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.320]   I think they're just, they're just establishing their bona fides for the game center app and
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.560]   setting the stage for a point when it comes out.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:45.520]   I don't, that was not present, there are ways that I think that any CEO presents a statistic
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.720]   in such a way that says that I'm saying this because we are now opening a brand new chapter
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.120]   in this keynote in which we announced an entirely new initiative that we're extremely
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.640]   proud of and putting much of the hopes of the company on for the next year.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.560]   And then there are the ways that say that we can make this claim.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.160]   We want to use this as a way of transitioning into something else in this statement that
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.440]   we're going to be making next.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:08.480]   It just didn't seem to me like the sort of thing that they're, they're, they want to assert
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:14.480]   that the iPod touch is one of the, is the definitive gaming platform in the universe.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.560]   I went to a PAX East a few months ago.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.000]   And although the games for the iPad, iPod touch are really quite awesome.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.200]   I did not see many people in the crowds during the keynotes and the Q and A's with, with,
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.160]   with iPod, iPod touches.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.160]   Everyone was using DSS.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.840]   So I, I, if you're a gamer, you buy a gaming platform.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.280]   Although I have to say I've been playing with this Citadel game.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:42.480]   It's the, the demo for Project Sword and it's clear that one of the things Apple has demonstrated
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.840]   is that this, this iPad has a lot of horsepower.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.440]   I mean, this is a great looking game or at least a great looking walkthrough.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.560]   I don't know what the game was like.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.560]   See, it's, it's, it's weird that Apple has managed to successfully invert the gaming problem
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:01.600]   that they have on the Mac where every, every, every game publisher will produce a game for
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.840]   consoles and for the PC first.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.600]   And if it is so magnificently successful that they can justify the development for the Mac,
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.880]   you'll have a Mac edition.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.800]   Now that's exactly the opposite.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.160]   Every mobile, everyone who wants to make a mobile game will make it on the iPhone first.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:18.160]   If it is so magnificently successful that they can afford to produce an Android version,
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.320]   then they will then produce an Android version.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.320]   Quite a coup.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   It's, I can't wait to get this game.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.200]   I have to say it's a, it's a, it's a hell of a demo.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.640]   It's like you download this free thing and it just, but you're fumbling for your wallet.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:40.240]   You just throw your wallet against against against like a glass door because money here.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.240]   Trade barter.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:47.480]   If I just keep saying if they just made we rule with the unreal engine, I would never
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.880]   stop farming.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.040]   So here's the real question.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.760]   Does, and this is something that's been bandied around a lot with Android, you know, obviously
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.200]   lots of different devices, different versions of Android itself.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.520]   And people are saying, you know, a lot of the pundits are now saying, well, you know,
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:09.160]   it's just a matter of time before Android overwhelms the iOS and iOS devices because
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.960]   there's just going to be so many more of them.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:17.800]   And it feels to me like a different situation than the, you know, the Macintosh Microsoft
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.120]   battle of, of yesterday year.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   But it's similar.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.120]   It's similar.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.120]   It's similar.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:29.480]   It's not, it's not exactly the same because Apple's kind of leading from a position of strength.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.400]   Whereas before, I don't think Apple really ever had that, you know, that huge first
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.480]   mover and market share advantage.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:40.520]   But yeah, on the other hand, you know, Google's licensing to everyone in sight.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.880]   Everyone in sight is building these tablets.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.520]   You're seeing these tablets showing up for 99 bucks.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.240]   They probably suck.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.240]   I don't know.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.960]   But, you know, there's going to be.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.360]   There's going to be a lot of competition because what now we're starting to see the
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.760]   beginning of the marketing and they're going to spend 400 million on advertising alone for
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.640]   Windows Mobile seven.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.840]   That's coming out in a couple of months.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:04.400]   As you said, there's going to be tablets from everybody, including Toshiba, Blackberry,
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.400]   Samsung.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:13.360]   I really think that the only real competition I see for Apple in the next two years is HP.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.120]   Because they're the only people who have all the components necessary to produce a credible
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.640]   threat because they bought the web OS.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.560]   That means that they can control the entire web OS experience, much like Apple can control
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.880]   the entire iOS experience.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.480]   Google can overwhelm with sheer numbers.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.240]   But the fact that they have so many different devices up there that are going to be lagging
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.920]   behind on two different levels, both in hardware level and OS level.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:40.360]   I really don't think that they can sell and market and have the same influence as iOS does.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.520]   I mean, we have a whole bunch of a couple of really good tablets I've had in for the
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.160]   past couple of months now.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.720]   And some of them are shipping with Android 1.6.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:52.440]   Some are shipping with 2.1, 2.2, and then there's going to be 3.0, which is going to be the
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.360]   first real tablet enhanced version of Android.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.760]   And so Google will announce it, Google will release it, and then I'll have to wait patiently
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:06.760]   to see when is my tablet going to be upgraded to 2.2 or 3.0.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.320]   And then you start talking about the problems of incompatibilities between software.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.360]   So what I mean by that is that the fact that Android will almost certainly always have
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.080]   higher numbers in terms of devices in the field.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:21.560]   I don't think they have the possibility of having the same sort of influence that Apple
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.560]   can have with iOS.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.920]   HP is the only one that can really pull that together.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.880]   And do you think HP can pull it together?
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:35.400]   I think so because they have the second component is that they are a consumer electronics company.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:40.520]   They're not a company that releases software and encourages people to visit a URL.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:45.080]   They are a company that can get this into every Staples, every Office Max, every Sears,
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.240]   every Best Buy, every big box store.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.200]   They can saturate the TV with ads.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.960]   This is HP we're talking.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.400]   I mean, let's face it, they're the blue iPod people.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:00.400]   They don't do consumer electronics well.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:06.000]   Oh boy, go walk into any Best Buy with 800 bucks.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.800]   I guarantee you that the two or three--
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.520]   Audis, no, the two or three Best Notebook are going to be HP devices.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:18.320]   The fact that they decided to buy POM and buy WebOS instead of trying to say, well,
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:22.080]   we'll just use Android and Adapted or we'll have someone else, we'll try to do a Windows
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.360]   7 in a mobile tablet sphere.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.520]   The fact they decided, we'll write the biggest check we've ever written in our lives.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:33.800]   We'll keep the office chairs, keep the ping pong tables, keep the guy that the senior mentor
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.480]   guy will buy him off.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:40.360]   All we want is your really cool OS and the people who know how to build it.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.680]   That tells me that they got a really good plan.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:48.080]   All I can say is I want to see competition.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.720]   I don't want to see Apple taken down a notch.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.040]   I just want to see competition.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.560]   It's good for everybody, including Apple.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.560]   It promotes innovation.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.720]   It promotes lower prices and it keeps them on their toes.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:57.720]   Absolutely.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:06.840]   That's 100% agreed on that because it is really the case that iOS needs to improve.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.560]   iOS devices need to improve and it's not that they're bad.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.960]   It's just that Apple can't be allowed to be sitting at the top all fat and happy.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:18.080]   I'm willing to bet that Steve knows that.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.640]   Remember Andy Grove wrote the book, "Only the Paranoid Survive."
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.280]   He was CEO of Intel.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.920]   I think Steve is in that group.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:29.800]   In fact, I remember Steve talking when he was still at Pixar about how Apple lost its
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:35.880]   lead, that Apple owned gooies in 1984 and it let Microsoft catch up.
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:40.680]   He said, "Within 10 years, Microsoft caught up because Apple sat on its haunches."
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:45.040]   I think Steve has learned the lessons of that and is pretty aware of it.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:48.680]   I don't imagine he's sitting on his hind quarters.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.520]   On the other hand, he has a clear vision.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:56.840]   It's interesting that he chose not to be driven by things like Google TV, but to the
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.840]   effect.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:04.200]   The other thing that I always go back to with Steve Jobs is the accidental empire's book
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.200]   by Robert X.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.120]   Cringley way back when they had the early '90s.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:12.120]   He talks about the difference between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates is that Steve Jobs wants
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:15.320]   to change the world.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.600]   The money is actually not really that relevant to him.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.120]   He obviously cares because that's evidence that you're doing.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.440]   Steve wants to win, though.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.440]   Let's face it.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   He's very competitive.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:29.480]   Well, it's just that he wants to win, but he wants to win by being a vaguai who changed
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   the world.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.680]   He's content with a smaller market share, you mean?
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:40.760]   Because the iPhone and the iOS, as Andy says, there's almost no way that the iOS devices
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:48.960]   can maintain the market share against 100 different equipment manufacturers.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.600]   It's almost not possible.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:57.000]   But at the same time, particularly if iOS and the iOS devices keep pushing the envelope
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.680]   so that everyone's playing catch up to Apple all the time, then it won't matter.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:07.440]   Honestly, what we will probably see is we'll probably see a couple of years where everyone
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:11.080]   tries to and then everyone's going to drop off because it's not worth it.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.480]   I mean, look at the number of portable music players out there now.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.120]   People tried for a while to keep up with the iPad and then they gave up.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:21.080]   The iPad just ate everyone for lunch.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   And so...
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.080]   That's not going to happen.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.080]   I have to tell you, that's not going to happen.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.240]   It hasn't happened in the phone space.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.960]   It might happen in the pad space, but it's not going to happen in the phone space.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.680]   It'll take a while longer still, I think.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.760]   It took two years to make a credible competitor to the iPhone.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.200]   I think there's a lot of good choices there.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:40.600]   Also, a phone is a much more personal and idiosyncratic device than a music player.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.280]   Music player is something you dip into a couple of times a day.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.400]   You don't really rely on your music player.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.840]   People have a lot higher expectations for a phone.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.880]   And the phone has become the music player, hasn't it?
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.160]   I mean, how many people carry a separate music player?
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.160]   That's true.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:58.280]   But you talk about things like, is the virtual keyboard on the iPhone enough for you?
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:02.120]   Do you want a mechanical keyboard like on the Droid X or on the Blackberry?
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:07.640]   Or do you want a really advanced virtual keyboard like the swipe system?
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.640]   Which is just...
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.840]   Boy, y'all.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:15.200]   If Apple is 20 bucks short to license this technology for the iPhone, I got the 20 bucks.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.200]   I got to 20, right?
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.200]   He is, Steve.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   I love it.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.960]   I keep seeing articles from people who are saying...
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.480]   I just saw an article yesterday saying, "Well, Android's fine, but it doesn't have the...
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   It lacks...
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.960]   I've got so much over it.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.200]   I just don't buy that.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.200]   Who was it?
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.200]   It's not...
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.240]   I'm sorry, but when I go back to the iPhone, I feel like it's lacking, to be honest.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.240]   No.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.240]   I disagree.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.240]   We disagree.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:44.240]   I think it's interesting that my appreciation for Android really went up a notch when I
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:49.480]   started playing with the newer larger size screens.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:55.640]   Because I've thought that the Android UI and the Android OS lacks sophistication, lacks
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.000]   a certain amount of elegance.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   And so when you try to make it fit on a tiny screen, it works that much worse.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.960]   When you make it a little bit larger, you give the UI a little bit more room to breathe.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.960]   You're not changing anything but just making the screen larger and giving my finger larger
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.960]   targets.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.800]   So I'm kind of curious to see what happens when you turn this into a 9.7 inch screen.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.720]   That if it will make even more sense when you make it larger.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:21.200]   Coming kudos to Apple that they made a basic OS that will work on just by anything you put
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.200]   it on.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:25.840]   But at the end of the day, it's whatever works.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.720]   We're going to take a break and come back in just a minute with your picks of the week
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.720]   gentlemen.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:32.120]   And we got you on such short notice, Adam.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.160]   Okay, I'll scramble again.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.160]   Good.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.840]   I knew you could find something.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:38.840]   Maybe AutoCAD.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.920]   I bet you there's a lot of...
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:41.920]   Probably not AutoCAD.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:42.920]   But nonetheless...
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.760]   A lot of people are very happy to see AutoCAD coming back then.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:49.560]   My hobby is designing water treatments plans and the speculavon on bivalual fittings,
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.560]   you see.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.920]   I did bits this week because there's an article about it.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.120]   AutoCAD is back on the Mac.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:58.040]   And that's kind of an interesting shift after a long time.
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.040]   Absolutely.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.600]   The first comment we got on that was the, you know, we're in Autodesk shop and we hate
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.600]   it.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.080]   Because if we look at AutoCAD, we hate everything else about Autodesk.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.960]   We don't really want to use it, but we do.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.960]   We have to.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.200]   Let's talk about Squarespace right now.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.320]   This is something people not only want to use, but love to use.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:21.640]   If you go to squarespace.com right now and give it a gander, I think you'll be pretty
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.840]   impressed.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.280]   Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.480]   It's hosting, yes, but much more than just hosting.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.200]   It's software that makes it easy to create content.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:37.360]   It gets out of the way, whether you're a photographer, a blogger.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:43.400]   Even if you're just selling something, Squarespace looks gorgeous, is easy to use.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.320]   In fact, those templates that they start with are so easy to customize that every Squarespace
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:55.320]   site looks like a professional design that goes way beyond what other blogging engines
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320]   look like.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.080]   I mean, just go to the examples page and take a look.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.320]   And all of this for $8 a month.

[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:22.040]   Actually, I know a lot of you are Vox refugees, very sad to see Vox moving on.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:26.720]   You might want to take a look on Vox and move you over to Typepad, very nice solution,
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.280]   but Squarespace has some real advantages you might want to take a look at.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.200]   Squarespace.com, try it free for two weeks.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.200]   Why not?
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.520]   What do you got to lose?
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.360]   If you decide to buy, if you decide, "Hey, you know what?
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.280]   I do like this."
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.840]   Make sure you use Macbreak as the offer code because that will save you 10% off every month
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.880]   for the life of your site.

[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.800]   social media and more.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.240]   This is the future platform, if you ask me.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.160]   squarespace.com, use the promo code Macbreak.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.440]   We thank them so much for their support of Macbreak weekly.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.440]   Andy, you're not cool.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.680]   We're going to give Adam some time.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   Give me some time.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.680]   I need some time.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.880]   Why don't you start off with your pick of the weekend?
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:17.080]   I haven't done an iPad or an iPhone app in a few weeks, and I just wanted to.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.480]   And as I was thinking, oftentimes, what I don't think to recommend are the things I
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.480]   really love.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.400]   I just use it so often that I even -- it's like I'm going to recommend my baseball cap.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.200]   Oh, wait, no, you do love that.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.760]   That is actually a Mac or iPad.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.240]   It's compatible.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.360]   My recommendation is an app called Emerald Observatory.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.560]   It's an iPad app that it is the most incredible, just like static distancing.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.680]   What it is is it is -- let me see if I might have to turn off some lights here to get rid
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.000]   of the glare.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.600]   My iPad usually lives in my kitchen or on the corner of my desk when I'm not using it.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.480]   And I was looking for something really cool to just be running on it when I'm not actually
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480]   using it.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.440]   So they would be doing something interesting and useful.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.600]   So what it is is, okay, look at the hands.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.800]   That is actually a clock.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.800]   So you can get the time off of it.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.440]   What it is, a complete and detailed astronomical clock in which you will get the phases of the
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.440]   moon.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   You will get what sections of the day and night over the entire planet.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.840]   Of course, time in multiple zones.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.520]   And I don't think I will have any chance of letting you see this.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.720]   But it actually has -- it would take a long time to show you everything that this thing
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.720]   does.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.680]   Every single one of those little bands represents another one of the planets.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:39.160]   So you can basically tell at any given time during the night if the hand is in the middle
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.640]   of one of those bands and you know that Jupiter is visible somewhere in the night sky.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.400]   So for this, of course, this changes minute by minute, second by second over the course
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.400]   of the year.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.520]   So if you want to -- if you're curious as to what planets are visible right now, you
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:57.080]   can see just checking this little band to see exactly which ones are there.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.520]   I don't -- I mean, I'm not going to lie.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:04.640]   I claim that the big feature of this is -- is much more than it's a really, really cool-looking
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.000]   clock.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.640]   But there are times when I will be looking at it and it will occur to be like, "Oh, wow,
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.640]   it's full moon tonight."
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.640]   Or, "Hey, well, right.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.800]   It looks like I'll be able to see like four planets."
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.080]   Like, there are actually four planets that are kind of like in the night sky tonight.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.720]   I wonder where I can find them, where I can see them.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.320]   And so it's just perfect eye candy and the sort of thing that kind of gets your imagination
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   going.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]   It's beautiful.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   It's just beautiful.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   How much is it?
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.920]   I have to -- I have to believe -- I've been using it for a while.
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.720]   I have to actually double check it.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.720]   I'm checking it right now.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.120]   I would just leave that up as a clock.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.120]   I mean, it's gorgeous.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.120]   Exactly.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.920]   I mean, it's like the perfect thing to have going when you're -- it's actually completely
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:39.920]   out.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.920]   It is just 99 cents.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   Oh, I'm buying it now.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.920]   That's great.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.240]   It is the perfect thing to have the screen doing when you have -- when you're not playing
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.920]   Netflix, you're not looking up a recipe.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:53.320]   You're not checking your email because it's just a beautiful design.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:05:01.240]   I am so in awe of people who can design interactive informational products like this, where it's
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.520]   easy to just do something that's kind of pretty and kind of interesting, but something
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:09.280]   that introduces so much information all at once.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.960]   And yet, if you just want to see what time it is, boom, it is very easy to find that
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.880]   it is actually just 10 minutes to four right now.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.240]   But what's the name of it again?
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:27.880]   It's called Emerald Observatory for iPad.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:51.080]   Nice shot of Andy's eyebrows here.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:58.080]   It's usually the day before we record.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:04.080]   I'm thinking about -- oh, by the way, make sure you have a pick ready to go.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:08.080]   And sometimes I can't think of something that I really feel passionate about.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:11.080]   And then I'm actually looking around the office and saying, oh, yeah, that thing you've
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.080]   been using every day for the past three weeks and keep thinking about my God, that's well
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.080]   designed.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.080]   Maybe you could recommend that thing, Andy.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080]   Oh, yeah, good one.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.080]   So I'm just going to plug in.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.080]   Obviously, it will stay persistent.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:27.080]   You can obviously change the power setting so that won't dim and won't go to sleep.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:32.640]   Especially if you have -- this is sort of my inspiration for wanting to actually have
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.160]   a picture frame sort of thing, just literally hanging in the middle of a wall instead of
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.080]   just sitting on an easel of the desk.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.560]   So again, really great stuff.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.200]   There's your pick Emerald Observatory for the iPad 99 cents.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.200]   And now -- also, it looks great to watch too.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.200]   It makes a great watch.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.200]   I'm going to say -- I'm sending my iPad Nano back.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200]   What was I thinking?
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.200]   I already have a bigger -- bigger battery in the iPad.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.200]   You want to recharge it quite so much?
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.200]   This is smart.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   Adam Anks, you're picking the week, my friend.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.200]   Okay.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.200]   Okay.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.200]   I've got Show and Tell.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.200]   It took me a minute, but -- okay.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:13.200]   So my Show and Tell is actually this little device, which is not iPad specific, but it
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.200]   looks awfully well with the iPad.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.200]   Notice this thing on the back of my iPad here.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.120]   It's a little hand.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.920]   It's a hand.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.720]   What it is called the Handy Holder.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.680]   And what it is is a -- it's sort of a super duper Velcro thing that attaches to the back
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.000]   of your iPad.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.800]   And then it lets you hold your iPad in a hand holder like this.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.200]   Interesting.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:40.160]   And you can -- it rotates, so you don't have to be moving your hand around.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:45.640]   So you can be walking around doing anything you want with your iPad and no worries about
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   it falling.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:52.080]   The company makes these actually has videos of them playing ping pong with iPads.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.080]   Not recommended.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:58.520]   They're clearly anticipating selling a lot of these.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:03.200]   So I was like, "Man, I hit the table way too often to play ping pong with my iPad."
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.200]   Not worried about it falling.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.840]   But it's this cute little device.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.720]   And then because this thing -- you know what, it obviously adds a little bit to the back
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.360]   there.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.360]   But it's a rigid circle here.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.400]   So they sell a bunch of different stands.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:20.400]   And I don't have too many of them here.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.400]   But here's one.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.680]   Actually, I'm going to extract it from the side of my desk.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:30.560]   They sell a bunch of stands that -- like this -- that this one's a C-clamp.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.920]   So you can clamp it onto a desk or a table.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:39.760]   And then the iPad just slots right in like that.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:43.680]   And so they've got another stand that you can actually attach to a wall.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.200]   They've got a clamp one where you can --
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.200]   I don't want one for my bike.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.200]   Can I put one on my bike?
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.200]   I don't think the bike one yet.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.840]   I can watch movies while I bicycle.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.520]   That's what I really want to do.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.680]   Make sure you download the insurance company app for the iPad if you're going to use it
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.680]   that way, though.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.400]   Adam, did they make a suction cup mountain for it?
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.200]   They did not make a suction cup mountain for it.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.680]   I think they were not happy with the certain kinds of things.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.400]   I actually also have some about a gooseneck.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.520]   And they said the gooseneck, they just -- the quality wasn't there.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.720]   And so -- but they've got a bunch and they've got a tripod mount.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.400]   They've got one that just -- you can literally screw into a wall so you can have your photo
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.400]   frame.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.360]   You just pick your iPad and just slide it, slide it in.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.480]   And you can pop that little hand thing off anytime you want.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:34.000]   It's leaving just a very, very, very thin little pseudo velcro ring on the back of your
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.440]   iPad so it doesn't mess up the iPad.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.720]   And it doesn't get in the way of docking it in the keypad dock.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.640]   So it's been -- it's kind of cute.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.600]   I've been using it for about a week.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   And I like it a lot.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.840]   Obviously, it's not iPad specific in any way.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.760]   So if there's any other clipboard or whiteboard or thing where you want it on your hand without
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:56.400]   being able to drop it, without having to sit there and hold it, that's pretty cool.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:02.080]   The guy who developed it actually developed it -- I was amused to discover this.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.800]   He was a runner and also timed races.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:12.320]   And he wanted to -- he actually had some guys, I know, build an app for him that would allow
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.320]   -- this is the people of big races, allow like spectators and finishers.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:21.480]   They have volunteers wandering around after the race and they could say, "Oh, here's your
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.480]   results."
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.360]   You know, you'd go up to them and you'd say, "You know, I'm race-oriented.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:32.160]   You know, number 853, and they'd have the iPad and they'd just type in your number."
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.600]   And they'd say, "Look, here's your results."
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.840]   Or, you know, during the race, they could show your family if they knew your number,
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.360]   things like that.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:43.600]   And the problem he ran into was he had these volunteers with iPads and they were constantly
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.200]   worried about dropping the damn things.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.200]   And so, you know, being able to have something where it's just sitting there, you don't have
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.360]   to put any effort into holding it and nice and easy.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:11:00.840]   So the iPad is a little slippery, honestly, that I sort of prefer the glass or the plastic-y
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:07.840]   feel of the iPhone for holding the aluminum just slides right off my fingertips.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.680]   So Handyholder, that's my pick of the week.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.680]   Good pick.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.680]   I like it.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.120]   Did I -- have I picked RDO before?
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.120]   I think I have.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.920]   Andy, do you remember if I talked about that?
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.920]   I'm not sure if you have.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:18.920]   None on the neck break.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:22.920]   Then I should mention it because we were waiting to see if Apple was going to do a subscription
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.920]   service.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.920]   They didn't.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.160]   We're still waiting for Google to do its Google music.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.600]   They still haven't.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.000]   And I've looked with envy at people like -- in Europe, we have Spotify, which allows you
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.760]   to kind of subscribe or people with a Zoom, allow you to subscribe and pay a monthly fee
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.320]   and get all the music you want.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.200]   There is a choice available on the iPhone.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.840]   They have, you know, only an iPhone app, but it looks fine on the iPad.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.440]   It's just, you know, you have to do it double size.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   RDI-O.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   RDI-O.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   Radio.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   No.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.600]   It's from the folks at Juiced and they say it's RDO.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.560]   I really want to call it radio.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560]   Really do.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.680]   You can try it free for three days.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.000]   You see that I haven't extended my three day trial because I'm still -- I'm not sure I
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.120]   want to spend the $10 to $15 a month.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.440]   It costs to listen.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.080]   But you can -- it's very much like having iTunes available to you, pretty much anything,
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.720]   any artist that you'd want.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:19.880]   You add, you download, you can play in a cache as well as a streaming.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.680]   And as long as you continue your subscription, it's available for you.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.760]   If you want to not -- if you've been looking for an iTunes subscription service and you've
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.160]   been kind of disappointed that Apple still doesn't seem to want to offer one, oddly enough
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:38.080]   they have enabled RDI-O to do it and they've approved the application, which maybe is a
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.840]   statement that they don't ever want to do it.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.160]   Good choice, I think.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:48.720]   I really like RDI-O.com.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.880]   I have a lot of music, so I don't know if I really want to pay for it.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.120]   And what's the difference between this and Rhapsody?
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.120]   Similar to Rhapsody.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:00.000]   I like a little bit better because it just -- I like the interface better.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.600]   I like how it works a little bit better.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.600]   Rhapsody might be cheaper.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.440]   I should look at the price because Rhapsody is $10, right?
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.800]   It says here that plans here on RDO start at $4.99.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:15.600]   $4.99, though, is -- there's some limitations on the $4.99.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:21.080]   I think it's $15 for the one that's comparable to Rhapsody, so I have to check.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.600]   Certainly worth looking at.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.080]   You can do Rhapsody and you can do RDO for both of three or one.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.080]   RDO Unlimited is $9.99.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.080]   $9.99.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.080]   So it's the same as Rhapsody.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.080]   Enough about it.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.880]   Yeah, I mean, US-only, if you're out of the US, you got Spotify, so don't give me a hard
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.560]   time, okay?
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.160]   And the quality's good, sounds good.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.800]   The truth is, I'm still using Pandora because I don't want to pick the songs.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.160]   I like the way Pandora plays them for me.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.960]   But if you want to music, you pick.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.400]   If I knew what to pick, I'd play my own music.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.400]   Exactly.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.080]   I want RDO.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:00.240]   I wouldn't want to speak for Chris Brain, but it really made an impression on me when after
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.680]   the Apple keynote last week, there was a tweet from him saying that, "Okay, I was hoping
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.200]   they'd announce iTunes streaming.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.560]   They didn't, so I'm now subscribing to RDO."
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.560]   Yep.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.720]   And if Chris Brain doesn't like something as ain't worth knowing about it, if Chris Brain
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.920]   likes it, it is instantly on your radar.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:15.920]   Absolutely.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.560]   And I think one of the reasons I've been slow to recommend this is because I keep thinking
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.560]   Apple will do this.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.800]   Would they bought La La?
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.400]   They have the capability, clearly, but they've decided not to do this.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.000]   It does Pandora like recommendations as well.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.800]   Since, you know, I say I like Joni Mitchell, it says, "Well, you ought to try Randy Newman.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.800]   I like Leonard Cohen.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.000]   You might want to try Richard Thompson or Nick Drake."
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   And then they're okay.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   They're not great.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.360]   They give you at least some Pandora like stuff to choose.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.640]   So why is it better than Spotify and Rhapsody?
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.600]   Well, Spotify is not in the US.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.600]   Oh, okay.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:50.280]   Rhapsody, I think the sound quality is better than Rhapsody personally.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.560]   But I guess you should try them both and see which one you like.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.560]   How about that?
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.560]   Okay.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.560]   There you go.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.560]   There's my recommendation.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.800]   Adam Anxt is the man behind tidbits.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.280]   Twenty years now, still, the must read.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.280]   Macintosh periodical comes out every week.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.480]   If you go to tidbit.com, you can read it online, but you can also subscribe and have it in
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.480]   your mailbox.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.160]   And it's absolutely free.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:16.720]   He also does some great PDFs that are not free but very affordable.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.880]   The in control series is really fantastic.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.560]   And if you go to tidbits.com, you can find it there too right now.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.560]   Small link.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.680]   But, you know, it's one of those things where every time we try to figure out how to take
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.400]   control links on the tidbits site, people don't see them when they're large and add
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   like looking.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.760]   So now we just have a small one.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.760]   And then they say, hey, we can't find it.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.160]   We're like, dude, we can't figure it out.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.560]   Search on Google on take control.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.560]   We're the top top hit.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.560]   There you go.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.560]   That's the easiest thing probably, isn't it?
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.760]   Search for take control.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.960]   You know, we've given up.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.480]   I mean, you know, it used to be for a while.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.160]   We're worried because we couldn't get take control.com because it goes to margarine.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:58.040]   But you know, so it is take control books.com.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:04.840]   But you know, Google has as according to the Google, we are what goes with take control.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.840]   Get that margarine.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.440]   Forget that margarine thing.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.120]   So that should give us the domain, right?
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   Well, you don't need the domain.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.120]   You got the Google.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120]   You don't need it.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.920]   I don't have to it.com.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:15.920]   I don't need it.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:16.920]   I got the Google.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.920]   Still a scary amount of trans fats for PDF file, though, Adam.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.560]   I have to say, I was going to go ahead and say that.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.720]   No, no, no, no, this is all local organic electrons.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.480]   We are small, but we do we're local for PDFs.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:35.880]   Actually, if they're really if they really were local, you know, like a sustainable print
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.720]   product, tidbits would be it.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.720]   Absolutely.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:44.480]   Tonya, I mean, I we haven't done this yet, but Tonya really, really wants at some point
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.920]   to get a booth at the Ithaca farmers market should for our take control e-books.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.320]   I was like, and what are we going to give them?
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.960]   You know, I need to tell them.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960]   Here's your Google us.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.680]   Here's your PDF, sir.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.680]   No, really.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.680]   This is the organic publication.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:02.680]   tidbits.com.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:05.320]   Thank you so much for showing up on such show notice.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.680]   We really love having you on, Adam.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.680]   It's great to have you.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.680]   Very well.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.680]   It was a good time.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.600]   Andy Inaco is the man behind the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.560]   He does it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.720]   He writes the whole yeah, the whole paper actually.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.720]   I'll do the drywall.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.720]   I'll do the flasher.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.240]   I'll do the finished carpentry.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.920]   Really, let it not go home solutions be your answer to home handyman price.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.320]   I'm not licensed or content for your food.
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.480]   www.cwob.com is his website.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.640]   Andy, great to talk to you.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.360]   Once again, you don't need to come out for tomorrow's a Google announcement.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.240]   I just don't think it's going to be worth the flight.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.960]   I don't think so.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:42.440]   I came this close to getting a free $400 flight voucher last week when flights got a little
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.440]   bit screwed up.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.280]   Had I gotten that, then yeah, I would have seen the hand of divine providence directing
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.800]   me to attend the Google event.
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.480]   However, the hand of divine providence being not in evidence, I think I'm going to be
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.480]   staying.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.480]   I do have to say there is one in my at least my eyes and my limited purview.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.880]   There is one reason to go to the Google event.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.960]   I was invited to that one.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:06.600]   Leo Leo, why are you not going to do during the event Leo?
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.280]   I'm not going to stream live.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.760]   I'm not going to stream live.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.560]   I'm not going to stream live.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.120]   There you go.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.120]   Okay, good.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   See Apple?
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.000]   Leo lives Leo learns and leave.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   It's all right.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.880]   I'm not going to humble myself by begging.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.280]   You could bring your iPad and kind of swing it around a lot.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.520]   There's no camera in it.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.840]   And I had the iPhone at the time.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:33.240]   I probably could have done it with the iPhone and would have been a little less obvious.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.240]   Thank you everybody for being here.

[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.160]   It's a good time.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.600]   You know, it's 3s or 7 because they're frivolous and unnecessary.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.480]   Why don't we make it with less?
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:02.040]   When we lived in Seattle, the Fremont district, which was kind of the artists, artists district,
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.840]   did in fact have a sign as you entered the district saying, you know, new time zone,
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.720]   you know, Fremont standard time.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.880]   It's just 17 and a half minutes different.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.800]   Every 21 minutes late because they're kind of big.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.480]   Do the calculations in your hand.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.480]   If you can.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.720]   If you can, you're not big enough.
