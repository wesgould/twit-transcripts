[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly and sorry about last week, folks.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.520]   Just couldn't get it up.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.160]   And you know, when I can't get it up, it's hard to do a show.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.400]   Well, it's not hard, but anyway, that's another matter for another day.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.920]   >> Merlin, man.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.560]   >> A film from the Gem Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.160]   Here's the golden nut at Casino and Five Las Vegas Le Mans.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.240]   >> Where's my rimshot?
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.040]   Andy Inaco from the colossal waist of...
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.000]   What's the B stand for now?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.760]   >> Well, bandwidth.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.520]   >> Oh, it's celestial waist of bandwidth.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.880]   >> That's still, I'm on a mission from God now to waste your time in bandwidth.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.440]   It's great to have you also from the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.560]   Scott Borne is there back from a long absence because we, I think we missed you on a show
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   right before we left.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.360]   >> Yeah, this is two week absence.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.160]   I've been, me and Alex have been busy, so, you know, I didn't, didn't, wasn't able to
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.160]   check in.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160]   >> Well, I'm so glad we got you back on.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.160]   Alex is also here.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.000]   Scott Borne is from the Apple Phone Show at ApplePhoneShow.com.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.160]   Girls Gone Geek.tv and Padango and, you know, he's doing more podcasts than I am now.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   It's really I'm impressed.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.160]   I live zone.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   >> Thank you, sir.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.200]   It's my goal to impress you.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.160]   >> You know, my goal is to, we're going to start doing video a little bit.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.040]   I'll talk about that a little bit, but I'd love it if you guys sometimes would come up
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.280]   here and do the show so that people could see your shining faces.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.920]   >> Yeah, I got to face Bill Radio Leo.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   >> No, you don't.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   You're a good looking guy.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.800]   Okay, I'll make the trip to Petaluma just because it's a pretty drive, but, you know, that's
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.000]   what I'm hoping people will come up here.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.240]   And then what we'll do Andy for you is we'll put a plasma screen with your, with your mug
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   on it.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.800]   By the way, Andy, good news.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.120]   You're on the album art.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.120]   >> Awesome.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.560]   Yeah, I got a picture and everything.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560]   >> We didn't turn down.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.280]   We didn't have a snaggy, a nitrous, I can snaggy picture of Andy.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.480]   So we put a placeholder on the Mac Break Weekly album art, but now we've got that we're going
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.560]   to take that Twit logo out and yes, it'll be Andy's head.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.120]   In fact, those of you listening on an iPod, hold your iPod up right now.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.800]   You could see his face.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.040]   And for those of you listening on iTunes, press that little button on the lower left
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.220]   that expands the album art.
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.220]   Look at that.
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.220]   Isn't he good looking?
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.280]   >> So you can either just imagine Adolf Manju with a hat.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.760]   >> I'm trying to think of Scott looks like he kind of looks like Captain Kangaroo.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.200]   Now everyone that writes me says, I look, I look like, you know, Mr. Scott on Star Trek.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   You're that James doing that.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.960]   >> He's going for Bert Reynolds.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.640]   >> Like in the third of his five at career, not the really awful fourth one, not the decadent
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.180]   third act, but the the meaty where he's got some grandis hair and he's looks like he's
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.160]   almost ready to accept that he's not 23 years old.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.800]   >> Talk about the boogie next, Sarah.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.720]   >> That was a good era.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   That was a good.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   >> That was a good.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.280]   >> That was stage four, stage five.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.640]   We're looking for post white white in the hair, pre plastic surgery.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.320]   I think that after Cosmo.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   >> After Cosmo.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   >> After Cosmo.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.960]   >> Yeah, much after Cosmo.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.160]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel core is here.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   >> Hello.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.800]   >> TV and Merlin man completes the set.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.260]   All five Merlin is for 43 folders.com.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.780]   So we were all going to talk about none of us has received an invitation for this Apple
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.740]   event coming up on Thursday.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.100]   What do we think it's going to be Scott born?
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.380]   You're the one who probably follows the few and you and Scott and Andy probably follow
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.660]   the phone the closest.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.260]   So I'll start with you, Scott, in the last gany.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.260]   What is it going to be?
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.660]   >> Well, it's going to be an announcement that there's going to be an announcement.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.260]   They're probably not going to release anything substantial.
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.620]   They may release an early beta, even alpha version of the SDK with some tidbits or some
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.020]   information.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.380]   The word we're getting is that the full bore kit will be available at WWDC.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.340]   And they're going to announce that they're running a little behind.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.340]   That's one version.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.980]   Another version is that there might be a base kit given and then they're going to add to
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.780]   it over the coming months.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.860]   And then they're going to do some kind of deal where they're trying to show that through
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.180]   probably some connection to the SDK that they have made the iPhone more enterprise friendly.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.140]   But I think it's going to be like sort of a non announcement is my guess.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.300]   >> You agree, Andy?
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.980]   >> Yeah, it's basically there's going to be a big post-it note on the middle of the screen
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.100]   saying, "I owe you one SDK."
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.100]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.460]   >> But I think really this has got to be one of those events where you have to figure
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.620]   out how tactical this is going to be, where they really got to start putting some cards
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.860]   on the table.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.100]   So yeah, I don't think they're going to be releasing anything that day.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.540]   I do think that we're going to get both the dog and the pony show demonstrating all the
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.500]   different things you'll be able to do with the SDK.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.060]   I think you'll see the roadmap for how apps are going to be released.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.940]   I wouldn't be surprised if, as a way to put an extra layer of gooey sweet frosting on
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.980]   the top of the cinnabon, that they decided to announce a 3G iPhone at this event because
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.500]   they need to do something to make sure that everybody covers this event, everybody reports
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   in this event, and everybody gets the message out, as Scott said, that all the reasons why
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.300]   you didn't buy an iPhone last year, you're going to be able to buy one this year because
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.860]   we're going to support MS, we're going to support all these enterprise apps and all
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.220]   these enterprise infrastructures.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.580]   I don't think anybody's going to be coming home with any changes in their plans that
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.740]   next day, but they'll at least have a roadmap for what they want to do for the next two,
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.740]   three, four, five months.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.940]   That would make sense then, none of us were invited.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.420]   It's not really oppressive, and it's an event for developers, you think?
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.420]   That's why they did it.
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.420]   Good.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.420]   We're going to go with that.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.420]   That's why they didn't invite developers.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.500]   You want to sign the ad left us out.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.700]   We're just as important as anybody else.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.700]   I'm not bitter.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.900]   I've never, ever been invited to one of these.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.740]   You've even spoken at Apple, but you've never been invited to a press event.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.980]   No, it's not breaking my heart.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.980]   I wouldn't go.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.060]   Do you guys get invited to lie?
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.060]   What do they do?
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.060]   They send you things?
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.060]   Is there a messenger?
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.060]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.060]   Oh, really?
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.700]   What they do is they put it on a MacBook Air before they used to just be a MacBook Pro
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.700]   17-inch.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.620]   They put this lovely invitation and the computer's yours to keep.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.780]   A guy in livery, actually, with white gloves.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.780]   Exactly.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.140]   I'm thinking Scott's going to the door.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.140]   He thinks it's his lunch.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.140]   Ding dong.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.660]   Open it, and it's literally a man on a horse with a very long mini trumpet.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.820]   And a glass slipper.
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.820]   And a scrawn.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.620]   Listen, the only reason I go is it's free orange juice and nice croissants provided by Apple
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.620]   kind of cost.
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.020]   It's actually kind of fun because also you see the entire Apple press core, you know,
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.500]   Jason and Dan and everybody.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.820]   Well, you know, we did cover for Twit because you didn't want to go, Leo, the big new iMac
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.820]   announcement.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.820]   I couldn't go.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.820]   Let's make this clear.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.620]   Apple, I wanted to go.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.620]   I couldn't go.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.620]   I wasn't kidding for it.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.260]   It wasn't in your lack of interest.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.260]   I apologize.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.500]   But Steve walked into the room during the after conference.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.500]   Oh, see, you see.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.660]   And that had never happened.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.300]   And he actually took questions.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.980]   So I mean, every once in a while, something surprising happens.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.140]   I don't look for a big surprise out of this announcement.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.820]   And you know, I think Andy's speculation about the 3G phone.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.020]   Now that's interesting.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.380]   And there have been some rumors we've received that they were going to announce one, you
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.860]   know, at this thing.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.620]   But I didn't find them credible if Andy has better information.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.620]   I hope he's right.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.620]   Cool.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.180]   I also think that I think that there's a problem, high probability that they would show, they
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.900]   would show, while the SDK may not be released, there's obviously some companies probably
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.860]   working on third party apps right now using some kind of partial SDK.
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.620]   So I wouldn't be surprised that we see EA or somebody else posting, posting.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.460]   Well, this is what we've already done with what we've been given.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.460]   And wow, look at this.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.860]   It's really cool.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.940]   And and seeing some of that starting to roll out, even though there's not a general SDK
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:39.940]   available.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.380]   And it's probably a surprise if Apple showed some third party apps that have already been
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.180]   developed from some of their closer partners.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.180]   Right.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.340]   They need to demonstrate that this isn't this isn't going to be just like web apps.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.540]   It's even better than the Generation 1 user interface.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.020]   They're going to show off things like the page curl that we see in the updated maps
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.020]   app.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.980]   We're going to see basically the like the difference between the very first iteration
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.980]   of the Mac interface in 1984 and then what they did after they had another year to think
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.980]   about it.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.980]   I think what we really need.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.300]   We need to see Doom with the being able to move move around by going back and forth with
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.380]   the iPhone and be able to fire with one little button and then be able to change weapons.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.380]   I think that would be pretty cool.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.380]   It's that's the game.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.060]   I ended all the kids are into these days.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.060]   Doom one.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.260]   Hey, I play Doom one for six hours on Virgin America on the way over.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.900]   I thought it was stupid when I saw it and then I started playing the video.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:38.140]   The Doom one Rick role video where the weapon instead of the BFG 9000 is a boom box playing
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.500]   is never going to give you up and it kills the monsters.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.500]   I mean, they just die.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.660]   It's a great video.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.660]   I don't know how they did it.
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.220]   It looked like it was a level of doom.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.060]   Have you guys ever used the Amazon iPhone app?
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.020]   Have you ever logged on to Amazon?
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.020]   I used to work first came out.
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.020]   Very good.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.020]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.020]   It's I don't know if it were me.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.380]   I there's all kinds of reasons why this is probably a difficult relationship for them
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.980]   to do, but not not least because they're eating their lunch on music as far as I'm concerned,
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.780]   but I'm as on Zeting iTunes lunch.
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.780]   My God, the quality, the price.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.780]   I agree.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.780]   I just really.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.140]   But what about the numbers or the numbers are the numbers?
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.620]   The numbers the opposite fact iTunes is now number two just under one line.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.620]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.020]   Anyway, all I was going to say was if it were me and I were the guy who was going to go
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:28.380]   out and decide who would be demoing that functionality, I would start with Amazon
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.620]   because talk about a disruptive application that because a that shows that could show
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.620]   a huge alliance with somebody really big and it could also show, hey, look, you know what,
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.220]   look what we can do for people.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.660]   You go out and you enter in, you know, scan the barcode or whatever and just buy it right
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.740]   off of Amazon from there.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.820]   So anyway, it wouldn't have to be that fancy.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.820]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.820]   I would start with a huge heavy hitter.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.900]   Well, let me take a photo of the serial number at borders.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.780]   It would be that'd be disruptive.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.380]   But there already doing that.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.660]   If you look at the shift in the iPhone commercials right now, it's not centering on the built
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.660]   in apps.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.620]   It's centering on customized like the customized Facebook app, customized web web experiences
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.460]   are tailored specifically to the iPhone.
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:14.060]   Obviously in a press event that's designed to show off what can be possible with the
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.860]   SDK, they're not going to show off a web app.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.140]   But this is our that's why I was saying I would that's why I'm saying I would have
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.900]   Amazon make an app is what I'm saying.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.900]   I'm not a kid at app.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.900]   No, no, but I mean, it goes a lot further than a web app, which you've got a something
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.700]   that's with you all download a 42 gigabyte catalog so you can, you know, so you can buy
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.260]   things while you're in the air.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.640]   No means that if you're in the air, you can type in the name of a book and when you log
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.740]   back in online, you buy it automatically or whatever.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.180]   It wouldn't take a 40 megabyte app.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.900]   But no, I'm saying it wouldn't be a web app.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.900]   It would be something.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.660]   No, but I don't see the point to offline Amazon browsing.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.500]   I mean, I see I see the point to having a built in support for with a really great cut
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.180]   and paste and copy feature that we're all hoping for to simply highlight something and
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.420]   say, please bookmark this as a possible Amazon search.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.620]   Oh, but I think what you're saying, Andy, is if it am is there's no reason for an Amazon
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.700]   app not to be as what it is now, which is a web app.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.420]   But what I was going to put out is the biggest one of the biggest victories that Apple has
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.660]   had is that they have succeeded in creating a third version of the world wide web.
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.700]   Before then there was the real web.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:18.380]   After that, then after that came the stripped down, no resources, no screen with no graphics,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.380]   no fancy anything mobile web that everyone uses on their smartphones, even the $500 smartphones.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.740]   But they succeeded in just one year in creating a third version of the web where if you access
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:33.140]   Amazon, if you access Google, all these other services and the host realizes that you're
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.500]   on an iPhone, it gives you an entirely different web experience.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.140]   And this is pretty much unprecedented.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.060]   I can't imagine a different company that would have succeeded in getting that sort of thing
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.060]   done.
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.060]   I think that though, if you had a standalone app, you'd have access to the camera.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.580]   And I think that having access to the camera, I think that'd be very painful to do through
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.580]   a web app.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.860]   And I think that being able to have access to the camera for a program like Amazon means
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.060]   that I walk into an electronic store, I walk into a bookstore, I walk into anything that
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:04.180]   Amazon sells, and I take a picture of that barcode and I can order it from Amazon.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.900]   And you couldn't do that.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:06.900]   That's a bad thing.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.700]   You couldn't do that with a web app.
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.220]   That's an application that a lot of people would use and it would make people go crazy.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.700]   But that's not at the stores.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.460]   That would be even better not as an Amazon app, but as a general app.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.300]   I mean, if the delicious monster people decided to make that as a portable edition, that simply
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.180]   says, I'm going to record that I saw this.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.660]   I saw this game at a friend's house or I saw this movie at a friend's house or even I saw
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:34.100]   this bag of shrimp flavored onion crisps at a party.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.100]   And I want to remember.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.140]   And there's already there, you know, Nokia does have, comes with a barcode reading application.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.340]   They haven't quite connected the dots, but it's clear that they want to.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.340]   They also have a screen reading application right now, which will read barcode out loud
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.820]   for blind users.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.100]   So I think that also if they, if you know, the business model for that is to just take,
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.100]   you know, fire it through Amazon and take your affiliate sale.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.100]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.100]   So this is a small.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.340]   There's 4% of a lot of orders.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:06.060]   Guys, I just, I just literally, while we're talking, got an email from a contact to AT&T.
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:11.940]   If you look at the AT&T data page now, and this could be a coincidence, but it says,
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:17.380]   to access AT&T's data, you need a 3G or edge compatible iPhone.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.260]   Whoa, I called it.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.020]   It's a change in the text from just a week ago.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.020]   There you go.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.020]   I think that's pretty, that's, that's confirmation.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.660]   That's an actual AT&T to, to release something before.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.820]   Apple must just hate them so much.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.300]   Well, every source that I have related to the iPhone was great.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.940]   Before you see the Ip upper features, you can only fly less than two miles with the new
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.340]   version of the iPhone.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.340]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.060]   I imagine someone who's just about to leave the company says, you know how I could really
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.380]   screw up both Apple and AT&T for shorting me on my last paycheck.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.380]   All right.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.380]   So we've got some interesting apps.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.860]   We've got, we've got gaming is obvious.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.220]   What a great gaming platform that would be.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.700]   I like the barcode Amazon tied to Amazon.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.420]   What other apps would we like to see on the, on the iPhone?
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.420]   Stand alone.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.580]   Anything that's push related works for me.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.740]   You know what I have on the Blackberry?
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.740]   That's fantastic.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.940]   It syncs with the Google calendar automatically, it pushes and pulls from G-Cal.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.900]   So my, I update the Google calendar on either side and it's always up to date.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.740]   That is, that is a killer app.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.660]   I know there's a photographer, I want the camera to be a little bit more fun to use.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:29.380]   I've seen some of the, the jailbroken iPhones have a cool little photo app that lets you
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:34.580]   zoom in and adjust the brightness and just those two changes make that camera infinitely
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.580]   more usable.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.660]   You could, I mean, there's a lot you could do with it.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.100]   That engine, you could do all of that stuff, including video.
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.220]   I'm hoping that the rumors are true that they're going to let us basically distribute free
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.260]   apps and then have people, you know, have, let's talk about that.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.260]   You want to sell them.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.900]   Well, the rumor is of course, is that Apple, if you want to sell your app, you're going
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.860]   to have to go through Apple and have it blessed and, and be able to sell it on iTunes.
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:01.380]   But if you want to give it away, the rumor is, is that Apple's going to let you do that.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.620]   Kind of like podcasting versus paid content.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.480]   I don't know if that's going to be true or not, but it would be great because there's tons
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.140]   of little utilities as a filmmaker that I would love to have of being able to build,
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.640]   for instance, a little digital slate or a little, or lots of coverage tools that are
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.620]   way too specialized to necessarily sell to a public.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.100]   But I think that there's markets for those things.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.780]   And hopefully, I mean, that's why you want a third party market is to let people specialize
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.780]   into a niche and serve that niche with plugins.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.740]   Yeah, but what about the stuff that doesn't work?
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.660]   That's, you know, that's, but that's the whole thing is that if Apple, I mean, there's
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.660]   podcasts that don't work.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.880]   I mean, there's podcasts that, yeah, I know, but there's a little bit of difference between
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.880]   a podcast on your iPod that you might be listening to on the train to kill time.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.040]   And this is your phone and it's your life and it's your connection line.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:52.480]   And, you know, we've all seen what happens when you load a palm up with 200 third party
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.240]   apps, you start crashing.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   And my, my feeling is that while I know it'll be an unpopular position to take the, to the
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:06.520]   degree that Apple controls the third party apps through the iTunes store, there's a lot
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:11.620]   greater likelihood that the iPhone will be completely functional because they'll double
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:12.620]   check that everything works.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.280]   What about free apps, though, Scott?
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.680]   Would you say that there shouldn't?
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.320]   Well, I'm not taking a position either way, but I'm just saying that, you know, it's an
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.180]   easy way for me to deal with it is I would probably avoid the free apps because I wouldn't,
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.360]   I wouldn't know whether or not they would be asked.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.900]   So then if there's a certification process and of some kind, you buy, and people like
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.160]   you, Scott, want to make sure that you only put certified stuff on there.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.800]   You go through iTunes.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.280]   That doesn't mean in fact that there can't be paid or free stuff that's outside of that
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.280]   process.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   That's okay with that.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.760]   That's an Apple certified, you know, that.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.360]   Well, you know, they're going to make money off that.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   Right.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.880]   Well, they make money on the iTunes stuff too, right?
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.680]   I mean, if I threw iTunes, I'll make money on it.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.800]   They'd be stupid to pass on that revenue.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.760]   Right now I have to point out you cannot buy games for an iPod that you don't buy through
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760]   iTunes.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.760]   That's right.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   That's right.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.600]   I think you're already doing that.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.240]   I think that I think this is all encouraging whatever the news is.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.800]   Well, it's discouraging if, notice that there is not a great and wonderful thriving game
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.440]   community for the iPod.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.200]   And I think part of it is because you have to go through that process.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.920]   So it would be discouraging to me if Apple said no development unless we certify it,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.840]   we allow you to be part of the program and we put it on iTunes.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.160]   In other words, killing shareware, freeware and open source development on the iPhone.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.840]   I think that would be discouraging.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.880]   And frankly, given what Apple has done with the iPhone, I could see them doing it.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.200]   Well, if they do that, then that'll be an invitation to the continued jailbreaking
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.600]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600]   Exactly.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.920]   And I don't think they'll go down that path.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.280]   But I would also say that they've modified their position on several things related to
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.280]   the iPhone.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.800]   So even if they start their Leo, doesn't mean they'll end up there.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   Right.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.760]   I mean, Tim Cook the other day in the analyst call said something that shocked me.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.120]   He said, "Hey, we're not married to any particular business model.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.320]   We're including locked phones.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.800]   We want to make the best phones in the world."
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.560]   I heard that in my toes curled.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.920]   Well, that's just prudent.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.320]   Look at how many phones are being used unlocked.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.120]   I know, but just the point is, is they are willing to learn.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.120]   Right.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.160]   Well, when the market makes them.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.160]   Exactly.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.160]   Well, that's business, isn't it?
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.080]   Merlin, what would you like to see on the iPhone besides your Amazon app?
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   I don't know.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.720]   I do like the idea of any kind of application.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.120]   I mean, well, you know, there's one that I guess I'll just beat the strum again.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.560]   I still think they really need to get some kind of an application for managing tasks.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.600]   They have no to-do list on there, even.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.480]   Nothing that's really integrated and it syncs automatically.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.680]   You can hack stuff up.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.040]   But I think that's a big hold just from day one with Apple.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.880]   There's lots of other stuff that I do like the idea of applications, the kind of last
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.360]   mile applications, something that makes a link that makes my life a little bit easier.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.040]   So I, you know, I phrase that I use a lot of 43 folders that I got from David Allen's idea
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.400]   of ubiquitous capture.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.280]   So anything that makes it easy for me, you know, like when I'm in the tunnel on uni,
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.760]   I don't, you know, I don't have a signal, you know, I think I think people can really
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.120]   overstate what you can do with a web app because I don't have a connection everywhere
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.120]   that I go.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.080]   Anything that helps make that connection, I would look for, but very much the top of
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.000]   the list, I would have task management.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Getting things done app or just something.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   It didn't even happen to you.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.480]   What makes Apple Apple and what makes people like Scott Moore and have the confidence to,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.360]   you know, really look to every app they put out as the app, you know, that you use is
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.520]   an integration.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.120]   And so something that allows that to sync up with ICal, at the very least, yeah, it doesn't
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.400]   need to be a GTD application.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.600]   It just needs to be some way to not have to hack the fact that if this is going to basically
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.120]   be like a portable computer, then I need a way to manage the action in my life.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.880]   That's just, you've got kind of a micro format with ICal with ICS anyway.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.960]   It makes perfect sense to make it, you know, all you really have to do is have it do that.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.640]   And then third party people like Omnic Group could do omni focus that integrates into that
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.200]   and add all of that functionality.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.800]   I mean, the way that I'm envisioning it is you think about the way that most applications
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.000]   for iPhones work, it's, you know, kind of a basic.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.080]   It's not so different from Go for a WAP, right?
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.680]   It's a menu that you surf and you drill down.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.880]   And I'm just imagining you would go to an area called tasks and then you drill down by
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.720]   the categories that are populated from ICal and there'd be a plus button to create a new
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   task.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.400]   I mean, something like that can't be that hard to put together or at the very least,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.680]   just, you know, God, even having a note application that you don't have to jailbreak your phone
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.680]   to sync.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.400]   So that's kind of nutty, isn't it?
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.560]   It's really, it's really weird.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.320]   I mean, it's really, you know, I realize that this is just the color of my crystal and
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   it's the stuff that interests me and my folks that share my interest.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:45.280]   But it's a really big hole to leave for this long and I think it's inexcusable.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   Over.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.680]   We're just thinking.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.400]   I want to drum machine.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.360]   I mean, like a little playing play.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.760]   Well, that's it from, you know, there's that great piano, the courting piano that you
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.680]   can get keyboard for.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.320]   I mean, if you look at what they've done with jailbreak apps in a very, you know, difficult
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.360]   environment, they've done some, I think, inspiring and interesting stuff.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.600]   I'm sure you'd see a drum machine.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   There's so much possible.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.480]   I mean, I've seen some jailbreak stuff that just is mind blowing and I'm hoping that some
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.480]   of that gets migrated.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.480]   I agree.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.640]   Maybe the SDK will include a upgrade path on the new MacBook Pros.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.920]   It makes sense.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.920]   New MacBook Pros are out.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.480]   Thank you for that segue.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.280]   I owe you one, Scott.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.040]   They in fact, that's how long it's been since we've talked because Apple slip streamed an
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.240]   upgrade and make a big deal about it to not only the MacBook Pros, but to the MacBooks
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   as well.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:47.200]   LED screens now available for the MacBook Pros, new faster processors, new chipset.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.840]   There is no, I guess it's not.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.200]   It's still Santa Rosa, but they are using the pen, the new pen, run chips from Intel, which
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.120]   are much smaller that are 45 nanometer process.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:03.200]   So that means lower heat, which means better juice, better battery life, one would hope.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.840]   And so far, benchmarks have said that not much faster, but nice screens.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.520]   Did you run out and buy one, Scott?
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.840]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.160]   You remember my promise?
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.560]   I promised to go all through 2007.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.760]   My MacBook Pro and I did it.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.960]   And for me, six months with laptops a long time.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.040]   And I was like, okay, the new one's coming out.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.200]   Finally, I'll get it.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.280]   And I looked at the thing and I was about ready to buy it.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.040]   And I was like, but wait a minute, excuse me.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.480]   And I looked at some benchmarks, it's one to seven percent faster.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.480]   And I'm like, huh?
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.360]   And so basically what I'd be getting out of it is one to seven percent more processing
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.440]   power and an LED screen.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.200]   And I think there's going to be a much beefier upgrade coming in the summer.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   So I'm going to hang out.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.500]   I'm not sure.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.120]   The other thing is I've never seen the LED screen on a laptop.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.480]   I don't know if it's great or what, but I didn't even know if I wanted it.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.280]   You know, I have to admit, Leo and I were sitting on the airport next to each other
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.000]   and Leo had the air and I had mine and it was much, much brighter.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.240]   It's a lot brighter and a lot wider.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.040]   When it's next to my MacBook Pro, which is what a year old, I mean, the MacBook Air
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.280]   is just it's extraordinarily brighter and wider.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.960]   It's easier to read Merlin.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.560]   I was really surprised because every time I've always been a flat for what he called
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.200]   Matt, whatever you call the other screen.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   That's all.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   And whenever I would look at something like Bob, but mostly likes to be called Matt.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.800]   But whenever I look at somebody's screen like that, it's really that's so ugly and
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.760]   it's so like windows looking like that.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.400]   But now, yeah, I love it.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.960]   And even when you turn it pretty far down, it still looks really good and it's super
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   crisp.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.760]   When I say white, I mean, as opposed to on the MacBook Pro, it looks kind of yellow.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   Contrast is better.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.760]   And the color experts tell me that it is much more reliable in terms of red reproduction.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.720]   You want an LED screen if you're doing Photoshop and color.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   Correctness.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:02.120]   I don't do that stuff on my laptop, but I just I figured I would probably want to get it.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.120]   But I say for a one to seven percent speed increase.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.920]   Yeah, you know, as Apple in a way, undermine themselves by doing so many upgrades.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.920]   You know, I bought a MacBook.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.240]   Of course, I bought a MacBook a week before they announced the upgrade.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.240]   Don't laugh.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.480]   That's not a little bit.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.160]   You know, I look there is no Leo effect.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.800]   And yet it still happens to me over and over again.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.480]   It's just what do you mean there's no Leo effect?
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.240]   We've got 10 documented cases.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.080]   No, it doesn't seem possible.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   At some point, at some point, it's not coincidence.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.680]   Well, the thing is, I thought I was safe.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.360]   Look, I they upgraded them in the fall.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.880]   I waited through Mac world.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.880]   No big announcement.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.840]   I thought, well, okay, there's no way three months later they're going to do another upgrade.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.920]   So it's safe to buy now and boy, and I was wrong.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:53.200]   And I think though, besides the Leo effect aside, doesn't this doesn't this impact buyers
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.280]   or who are going to say, boy, you just you cannot predict now when there's going to
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280]   be an upgrade?
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   Is it safe to buy?
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   I think that's the idea.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.120]   Well, doesn't it sound more as if this isn't an intentional.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.920]   We need to upgrade these machines because darn darn it, the MacBook Pro line is supposed
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.400]   to be the pinnacle of technology.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.560]   It sounds more to me as though they know that they're going to have to be buying these
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   screens in quantity.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.320]   They know they're going to be have to be buying these processors in quantity rather than limp
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.360]   along for the next three, four, five months.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.280]   Why not take the stock that they're going to be that they already have in hand that they're
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.600]   going to be using into this this this falls notebook, sure the summer's notebooks and
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.200]   start putting them in the old boxes.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:33.160]   Yeah, rather rather than by huge quantities of these old style LCDs that they're not even
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.160]   going to be anymore.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.400]   And also it's the pen and chip and you know, of Dell has announced pen and laptop.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.800]   So in a way, you're right if it is in a way, Scott, the idea of keeping up with the, you
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.720]   know, the Jones is also I should point out it does not update the chipset and Intel has
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   an updated chipset for pen rent coming out in a few months.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.960]   So it seems very likely that this is going to happen again in just a few months.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.000]   I'm betting that Intel told them we're not making the other ones anymore.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   You want computers?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Here's what you get.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.560]   Ah, that may be.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.280]   I'm betting that's exactly what happened and that's why they stuck them in there because
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.480]   they're until does that until does like to keep, you know, some of the older chips around
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.320]   for people want to do lower end and so forth.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.320]   I don't know if Intel would make that deal.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.320]   Maybe they would.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.960]   And I think that, but I think it makes sense just, I mean, they didn't do a lot of fanfare.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.520]   They didn't do a big announcement.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.520]   They didn't do any of that stuff.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   They just bumped it.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.480]   You know, and I think that it's just a matter of.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.720]   So that's to make buyers like me just not put it off.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   What's house cleaning?
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.160]   I don't think it's, I think it's just house cleaning of, you know, we now have a better
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160]   computer.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.840]   We don't have to, you know, I don't think that Apple makes big events anymore for its
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.840]   hardware.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.840]   No, apparently not.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.120]   You know, I think that they, and I think that they're focused.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.000]   I mean, they make more money with the consumer, with the consumer hardware.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.200]   I think that they're going to continue to, you know, that the hardware is going to, I
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.760]   mean, it still sells, it sells well.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.680]   You want to keep it current, but I don't think that they want to necessarily take the PR punch
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   away from the iPhone and the, if they announced the, if they had gone through all that fan
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:04.800]  fare and brought all that press in last week for a, for a Mac update, you know, it'd be
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.080]   hard to get them all back this week for an SDK update.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.840]   You know, and so I think that, I think they're staying focused on the things that make the
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.840]   most money.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   Oh, I'm okay.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.240]   Oh, I'm going to go on cobwebs on my current MacBook Pro.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   That's all I got to say.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   But, you know, I have to tell you, it's already six months old.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.920]   If you follow, if what you, if what Apple's doing is following Intel's roadmap, it sure
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.600]   looks like they are, then it would be prudent to wait maybe a little bit longer and get
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.640]   that new chipset, which should make frankly more of a speed difference than just getting
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   the penmanship in there.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.920]   But I think it's also, we're, we're in a, we're in an odd place where we are, you know,
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.560]   we buy, we have almost the newest computer all the time.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.880]   I think that, you know, for people who have been hanging on to something a lot longer,
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.720]   I mean, they just may get to a point where, you know, they need to get a good, good,
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.720]   a new machine.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.720]   This might be the time to do that.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.880]   I also predict Blu-ray in the next, the next upgrade.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   So I'm waiting for that.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.880]   I think Apple's wanted to do that.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.680]   I think that's just a question of getting the drives at a reasonable cost and getting
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.680]   media prices down.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.400]   It was very expensive right now to get up.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.080]   If you could find a blank Blu-ray does a lot of the rumor sites say that it was actually
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.200]   slated for this upgrade, but some sort of mechanical problem kept them from releasing
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   it.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:17.480]   I wonder how much of a software or firmware upgrade you'd have to do to do Blu-ray.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.680]   Do you have to support now a ACS, for instance, or whatever the encryption technique Blu-ray
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.160]   uses?
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.680]   If you want to play Blu-ray movies, Hollywood says you do.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.840]   Microsoft did.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.560]   And it's really to the detriment of Vista.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.640]   It's been, I think that's been one of the reasons Vista has a lot of problems is the
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.800]   support for these copy protection technologies.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.240]   And it's built into Vista willy-nilly, even if you buy a business machine, even if you
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.320]   don't buy a machine with HD.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.640]   And I don't think Apple would do that.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.720]   I would hope they wouldn't do that.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:51.400]   But I think you would have to modify the operating system for a Blu-ray player if you wanted
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.600]   to play Blu-ray discs.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.280]   Do you want to play Blu-ray discs on your Mac?
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   I don't really care.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.280]   I'm just going to die with these.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.600]   I want to see them on a big screen.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.760]   I want to watch them, but I also really want to record them.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.400]   Well, I could see as a data recording device.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.400]   I mean, 50 gigs.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.400]   I mean, that's great.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   I'm just going to add Apple.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.400]   Go ahead, honey.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.240]   I'm just saying at this stage, I'm not used.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.440]   I'm not wedded to actual physical media on movies anymore.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.440]   This DB's have become exactly like CDs where it's just the medium on which I purchased
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.400]   the thing before I convert them into a more useful digital format.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.120]   Ah, but you would need a Blu-ray player to burn them, to rip them.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.560]   Yeah, well, but assuming that someone figures out a really good DVD, excuse me, a good
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:42.320]   Blu-ray ripper that's just as good as handbrake is, I mean, I'm sort of questioning how useful
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.720]   Blu-ray is going to be to me.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.920]   I'd much rather hold on to DVD and be able to make a version that could put on my home
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:54.080]   server and pipe to any computer or any Apple TV or any device I have in the house or in
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   my pocket.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.040]   Well, I have to point out.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:03.120]   Alex's point is well taken in that I've watched several movies already now on my new Apple
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.320]   TV 2.0 and the experience was very good.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.800]   The HD movies, they say it takes seven or eight minutes to start in my case, 30 seconds.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   And I just soon not have to deal with the physical media.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.760]   If they get enough, they don't have enough movies yet in the store.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.600]   But once they do, then I can see making that a more consistent choice.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.040]   So the Blu-ray isn't a big deal to me, but if they're going to come out with it, you might
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   as well have it.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.920]   Which is that there's no pressure on Apple yet to really do it.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.720]   Not that they're waiting, but I think that they probably, hey, if it's not quite worked
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.040]   out yet, we can afford to wait.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   I mean, I'm going to say-
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.800]   I doubt there's that many people who are waiting on, particularly buying a laptop for
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   Blu-ray.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   I'm more interested in having a Blu-ray for my Mac Mini than my-
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.600]   Or you use your Mini as a media device.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.320]   The media device, yeah.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   But you can't-
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   You can't you buy an external Blu-ray.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   I guess you can.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   I haven't tried.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.320]   Yeah, we have one here in the studio.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.320]   And it's hooked up to a Mac?
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.240]   And you can play the movie through it?
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.760]   Well, we're using it as a backup device.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.240]   I don't know if we play movies.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.240]   I wonder.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   So, you know, this is something-
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   I'm not trying.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.680]   As I understand it, and I know that our listeners will correct me if I'm wrong, but
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:19.240]   as I understand it, it's up to the movie maker, the person who's making, authoring the disc,
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.640]   to turn on these protections.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:27.920]   And so far, nobody does require HDCP compliant hardware, but they could.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.040]   So you could get in a situation where you've got a Blu-ray player, a computer that's capable
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.960]   of playing Blu-ray movies, a monitor that's capable of displaying on high def, but it won't
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.880]   play because the monitor is not HDCP compliant.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.040]   Or the, you know, or the player isn't.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.080]   You know, the new Blu-ray spec does require, you know, an internet connection.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.080]   Right.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.280]   So they could simply set up a much simpler system where there's no kind of encryption.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.200]   There's just an authorization code sent over the internet that says, "Yeah, he's cool.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   He paid the license.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   Let's go."
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.360]   Yeah, but if you're not on, if you're internet's down, you can't watch a movie.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   That would be the-
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   That would be the-
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.360]   That would be the-
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:02.360]   Informed porn-
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   Disadvantaged.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.360]   That would be the-
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.840]   If you're on a plane, if you're on a plane, you can't watch a movie.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.840]   Right.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.240]   Now, right now they do, there's two reasons you want the ethernet.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.520]   One is they say, so for upgradability.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.200]   But the truth is it's also so they can revoke keys.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.320]   And they did build this in because after their experience with DVD encryption being cracked,
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.040]   it's about three minutes.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.760]   They said, "Well, what we're going to do is we're going to make it so that we can revoke
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.800]   the keys of the players.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.880]   So if something has been cracked, we could just pull back the key and you have to update
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:32.120]   your system and we can then update around the crack."
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.120]   So that's why the ethernet-
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.520]   It wouldn't be possible that they could- They could authorize a movie, send you the
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.720]   key and then once the key was sent, it's stored somewhere and you could go offline and view
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.720]   the movie.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   Sure.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.720]   So I mean, you wouldn't actually have to be connected to the internet.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.720]   That's kind of what happens now.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.240]   If you buy Windows Media and you put it on a Zoom or you put it on a player, is it plays
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.080]   even though you're not connected to the internet?
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:34:01.640]   I would prefer that system to a physical encoded thing like, "Oh my gosh, that stupid copy
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.280]   protection they started with in the VHS days."
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.080]   What was that called, Alex?
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.080]   Back-or-a-vision.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.080]   Back-or-a-vision.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.240]   Hey, I wanted to mention as long as we're talking about that, that the Fox Disc, the
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:18.880]   Simpsons Disc that you bought with the supposedly unprotected data version, that version, I've
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.600]   got a number of emails saying that version is protected.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.240]   That you can only- There are limits to what you could do with it.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.800]   You can only play it on a certain number of machines or something.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   I'm not sure what the details are.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.640]   I'll have to look and see if- Find the email.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.680]   But they said it was protected, which is too bad because that would be kind of cool.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.680]   Like I had who cares.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.040]   It's just amazing how they keep on cutting their nose off.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   They don't get it.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.480]   Some more news in the Mac world.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:53.000]   Steve Wozniak apparently is not happy with Apple or anything.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.080]   He doesn't like the iPhone.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   He doesn't like the Air.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.080]   He doesn't like Apple TV.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.840]   He gave an interview to the Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.400]   I'll try to channel Woz here.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.400]   Tell you the truth.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.120]   I was really disappointed when the iPhone was introduced.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.520]   Off the phones in the AT&T of the store, we're at the time we're to 3G phones.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.000]   I was shocked.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.800]   This is what you've been saying, I think Scott.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   I was shocked because Apple is bringing the full internet to mobile's full web pages with
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   pictures and everything.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.360]   It's not 3G.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.960]   I knew that would be a speed detriment.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.040]   It's a speed detriment.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.440]   I've never taken that position.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.760]   I personally don't care that much about 3G.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.800]   I think that it'll be nice because it'll stop all the winers from wine and once it's there.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.280]   I wonder what the battery life's going to look like.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.440]   I can tell you what it's going to look like.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.440]   It's going to look a whole lot less than it looks like without 3G.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.960]   He said I never heard that it was a battery issue.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.160]   He said I don't understand why it would be a battery issue.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.520]   I get as much life on my 3G phones as I get on my non-3G phones.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.560]   He says he still uses the iPhone.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:57.080]   He praised it but he also carries a Motorola Razr for taking calls and browsing the web.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.080]   There's my phone.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.080]   It must be.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.080]   Let's see if it's Apple's call.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   Beats on the line.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.200]   It turned up the phone ringer just in case Apple wanted to call and invite me to anything
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.920]   or announce anything.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.080]   If I call off and take a phone call this time, it won't be for Microsoft.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   By the way, still have it done.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.080]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.320]   This is a weird timing because I just got a message from a source of mine who said that
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.080]   I was deliberately left off the list.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.000]   Oh, there you go.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.040]   I'm not going to count on them as a source anymore.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.640]   I don't think I even like that attitude at all.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.480]   You did it on purpose.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.480]   Let's see.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.640]   What else did Waz say?
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.800]   He said he doesn't like the Apple TV.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.280]   Yeah, I never.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.440]   He says he still uses the phone.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.120]   The MacBook Air was launched in January.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.400]   Wazniak agreed with the criticisms about the lack of TV and missing ethernet.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.920]   He says, I don't think it's going to be a hit.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.280]   By the way, the sales figures are out.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.280]   It's a hit.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   That was before the interview.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.720]   He said he likes to burn a lot of DVDs for friends.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.520]   That's good.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:03.680]   I'm a billionaire and if you're into copyright law, you might want to sue me.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.400]   He also likes to afford to buy everything that comes out the moment it comes out and
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.200]   get for my friends.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.000]   He also watches movies on planes, so he needs the ability to swap batteries mid-flight.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   I think that's true.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.120]   I'm trying to figure out a way to make the air a part of my life, he says, because I'm
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.760]   a one laptop kind of guy, but I don't feel it's a benefit if you have to carry the air
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:27.400]   plus a DVD player, plus a couple extra dongles to connect to ethernet things and also maybe
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.600]   an extra hard disk to carry your music.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.680]   Still, there's a pureness in that.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:38.200]   I could have had a fine Tuesday without thinking about either Steve Wozniap's lap or his dongle.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.040]   Okay.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:47.000]   He says Apple TV is a really good indicator of where the future is, but he must listen
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   to this show.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.800]   I have been remiss.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.080]   I've talked to Woz back and forth several times.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.880]   He wants to be on the show.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.080]   I will get him on the show.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   He's getting.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.080]   You should totally have him on.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.080]   He's very amenable.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.400]   He's totally like he just hangs out and talks to you, please.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.240]   We've had him on Twitter many times.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.640]   It'll be great to have one.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.040]   In fact, we had him on the Twitter.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.240]   People hated more than any other Twitter until last week.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.600]   Now you can't just leave that out there.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   What happened?
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   Now he can come on Twitter.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.320]   I had Dave Weiner on and everybody got upset.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.600]   I thought Dave was great, but Dave is a little prickly and he was talking about RSS and stuff
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.120]   and people thought he was insulting.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.120]   I don't know.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   He invented that.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   He knows a little bit about it.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   Did he mention that?
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.120]   He invented it.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.480]   I love Dave Weiner because he's the only more prickly person on podcast than me.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.320]   He is very prickly.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.720]   He was great.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.480]   And de Vorac even said, "I know nobody's listening anymore, but I just want to say
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.560]   I've really enjoyed this conversation."
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.800]   Anyway, it is now officially the most hated Twitter.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.760]   Steve can come back because yellow lasers is no longer the most hated Twitter.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.760]   That was the one he was on.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.360]   Did you get a lot of mail from people?
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.360]   Oh, I always do.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:59.280]   I know when I'm going to get mail from people because anytime you stretch the format a little
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.560]   bit, I blogged about this.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:08.440]   There are people who really want Twitter just to be Patrick Norton and me and the only
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.960]   tech TV guys just sitting around.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.360]   And then there are also people who just want to be a tech news show.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.000]   As I said, the nice thing about doing these shows is we can do anything we want.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.120]   We don't really have to curry favor with an audience.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.280]   We do what we think is interesting.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.120]   Get email number one, it reads something like this.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.200]   Leo, if you ever have de Vorac on there again, I'm going to stop listening forever.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.120]   Email number two says, Leo, if you ever fire John de Vorac, I'm going to stop listening
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   forever.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   Exactly.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   Exactly.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.640]   Actually, I did get one that said, "Finally, somebody more annoying than John C. de Vorac
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.920]   and Scott Borne, Dave Weiner."
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.240]   That's me.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.600]   I'm glad to be on that list.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.000]   I'm a crumogen in training compared to this list.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.880]   To be on, trust me.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:58.680]   Anyway, he was says, "He doesn't like the 24-hour time limit," which we've all agreed
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.040]   is too short.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.440]   My life is way too global and unpredictable for that.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.040]   I get interrupted by something and I won't finish it and I don't want to have to pay
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040]   again.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.440]   The guy carries $20,000 in his britches, but he doesn't want to pay another $3.99.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440]   I don't blame him.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.920]   He's not cheap, he's just frugal.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.200]   He wants to get the value for money.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.560]   I don't blame him.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.960]   Even if it's a buck, why should you have to pay again?
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.360]   That has prevented me from renting nearly as many movies as I might have.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.760]   I can only rent a movie if I know that for the next 90 minutes to three hours, I will
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   have no interruptions.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.240]   I will be able to start in the very session, whereas I would love to just simply get a
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:42.120]   movie to have it and then know that over the next two or three days, I can just consume
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.600]   it in negligible chunks.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.800]   My biggest problem is I'm not finding movies I want to see.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.800]   I think Apple was reported as it's fallen way short of the fact that I'm not going to
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.200]   get the $1,000 movies that they had talked about.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:41:01.040]   I just want to point out that I believe in all the data I've read indicates that this
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.120]   isn't necessarily Apple's fault.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.880]   These restrictions were reported and negotiated in by the studios.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.360]   It's not Apple's fault, but it's Apple's problem.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.080]   I don't think that's not it.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.760]   No, I've bought my fourth or I've rented my fourth and final movie until this change
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.200]   is just because it's crazy.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   I mean, and I'm not going to lean on this whole kid thing, but it's true.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.480]   If you've got a kid in the house, you're not going to sit down and watch Dr.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.600]   Chicago in a sitting.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   It's not going to happen.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.200]   And yes, Dr. Chicago is one of the few decent movies that you can get on the internet.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.520]   With the without a kid, I'm not going to sit down and watch Dr.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.080]   Chicago, but I give up Julie.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.120]   I want to hear about what you want to hear all about that.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.400]   The greatest movie ever made.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   I saw it.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   I saw it.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.880]   I would make out with.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.120]   Can she play the balla like?
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.200]   I would, I would make out with Julie, Kristi, and a Marsha reef.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   Those lips.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.200]   Now, how did your plays go?
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   His eyes are lips.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   Oh, she goes too early and leaves Omar and I to play bridge.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   He is TMI.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.040]   Anyway, I think, and actually, I think this is something that we have underplayed and really
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.080]   should be more aware of.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.400]   I think Apple's heading into a buzz saw in its business model as the record companies.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.920]   And now I think the movie industries are turning their backs on Apple.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.560]   They don't want Apple to be so powerful.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:21.280]   That's why the record companies offer unprotected high quality music to Amazon and everybody
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.880]   else, but not the iTunes.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.600]   And I think that's why the movie company, I think Steve Jobs fully thought he'd get
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   a thousand movies.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.360]   And I think it's why the movie companies are saying, well, you can have Bill and Ted's
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.240]   excellent adventure.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.320]   I really think they don't want to give Apple any more power.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.760]   And I think this is going to hurt Apple much more than anything else.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.760]   Apple's got a great model.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.600]   They've got a great end to end business.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.280]   They've been very clever about putting all the pieces together.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.800]   There's one piece they don't control.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.240]   The content piece and they're losing.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   And I think that the long run.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.360]   The wealth is going to provide the movie studios and the record companies with a big
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.720]   wheelbarrow with which people can dump their money.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:00.280]   Amazon just announced that they're going to do high def unbox.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:05.040]   I think these conversations are moving aggressively.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.440]   These conversations have taken place with Walmart too though.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.240]   I mean, they all tried to fight Walmart because Walmart tells them what the box can look
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.240]   like now.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.040]   They don't have so much control over them.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.360]   And they have to do business with them.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.240]   And I think they're in the position with staff.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.520]   They have to do business with Walmart.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.880]   They don't have to do business with Apple.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.400]   You think they have to do business with Apple?
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.280]   If they want to sell downloads to more than eight people, I think so.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.800]   I think the witch, six of which are buying them because they're pissed off at Apple.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.600]   Yeah, they're going to have to remember.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.960]   I think that if someone else comes by that does iTunes better than iTunes, that's the
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.560]   way things are just going to be.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   And they're not even close to do it.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   And they're not even close to it.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.320]   I'd love to see competition.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.280]   I'd love to see someone give iTunes a run for their money.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.280]   I'm never pro Apple.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   I'm always pro consumer.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.800]   And I've been in real competition is always good for the soul.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:56.000]   But again, you can't just simply toss unprotected songs on Amazon and say, voila, we have iTunes.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.640]   This is exactly how the Soviets tried and failed to do a space shuttle.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.000]   They made something that looked like a space shuttle, but not quite so much.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.480]   Now it's a playland toy.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.920]   You want to get the crank.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.920]   I don't think of it enough.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.920]   I think it'd be enough.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.920]   Jeff, Jeff Bezos.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.640]   And I think you're going to be very surprised.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.120]   And I don't think I think we're going to realize you, though, let's just keep it a
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.480]   movies.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.600]   You're never going to get Apple TV to off the ground and Reynolds off the ground if you
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.800]   only have crap to rent.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.920]   Well, I think that if Amazon number one is if Amazon wants because I still think and
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.280]   I'll say this again and again and again, if Amazon wants to be competitive, they need
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   to go get Adobe air and they need to build a standalone application and give up on a
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.280]   webpage.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.280]   It is so painful to go buying stuff when you're used to iTunes.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.680]   Absolutely not painful at all.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.600]   You search Amazon for no, I'm not.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.320]   Well, no, have you bought anything from Alex?
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.680]   Yeah, I have all my albums from Amazon.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.080]   I have moved entirely off of iTunes to Amazon.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.360]   I buy every town on Amazon.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:52.440]   I went to Amazon yesterday morning and I said, I want some Patula Clark and so I searched
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.520]   on the book.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.520]   The top level, right?
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.000]   It took me to the return.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Bad presents.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   You're hit parade.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.960]   I love so much brighter there.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.160]   You could forget all your troubles forget all your.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.160]   Go ahead.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.160]   Merlin.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.800]   And then you click on where it says mp3 downloads and you do one.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.440]   But all I'm saying is, dude, here's what I'm trying to say.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.440]   Here's what I want to get across.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.480]   I want to get across that I have the deadest ears in America.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.360]   I stood in front of an orange amp for five years blaring at my head.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:22.400]   I cannot hear the difference between any two things.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.120]   I'm here to tell you about a double album for 10 bucks.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.400]   It sounds better than anything I ever bought on iTunes.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.120]   I know they're not going to take oxygen out of the vertical or anything.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   I'm just saying that unless iTunes, unless they can find a way, I think it's going to
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.400]   be a thorn in their side because people are eventually going to go.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.760]   I want to buy huge amounts of music and I don't want to have to worry about it.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   But the DRM.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:46.960]   I think what you start buying on Amazon, I now actually have a feeling of revulsion about
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.320]   going to iTunes and buying an album because I know it's my safety school now for buying
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.320]   music.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.320]   It's not where I want to be.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.440]   If I buy something off of iTunes, it's a flippant little like I just want to listen
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.440]   to this right now.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.200]   99 cents is fine.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.280]   The issue that I have with an Amazon.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   What are you buying on iTunes?
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.880]   I mean, what do I buy mostly TV shows?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.600]   I mean, that's 90% of what I buy on TV shows.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.600]   But I buy stuff like I mean-
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.000]   Any TV buy stuff at iTunes?
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.080]   I buy almost all my stuff off of iTunes and for one simple reason because the Amazon as
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.960]   good as its intentions are, as good as the quality is and as important as it is to have
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.800]   unprotected songs, it's a Walmart version of a music store.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.200]   They're not willing to sell you exactly what you want.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.840]   They're willing to sell you something that's sort of okay.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.840]   If you find that-
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.840]   I understand that.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.440]   I'm about to explain it.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.120]   In terms of finding a specific Petula Clark album, okay, you're in there like you're in
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.120]   there good.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.920]   If you're looking for a certain version of a song, however, they'll give you the Petula
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.240]   Clark version, they might find you one cover version, but if that's not what you're looking
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.240]   for, you're done.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.920]   On the iTunes store, you can choose between 12 different covers spanning two or three
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.920]   decades.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.480]   If you're looking for something that's a little more earthier, a little more involved
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.440]   than a Petula Clark song, if you're trying to get into classical or jazz or anything that's
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:07.040]   not really, really pop music, you're kind of screwed because you can find a really bad
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.120]   Russian recording of let's recurium mass.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.480]   You can't find the really good one that everybody says that you should get.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.600]   We're not talking about something that is nobody has heard of.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.800]   We're talking about the definitive recording of-
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   So you're saying this election is inadequate?
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   Well, but not only that-
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.720]   I don't think that's a permanent liability.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   That's just a question.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.880]   This election was sucked at iTunes for the first year.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.040]   Not only that, but it's not as browsable as iTunes.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   I'm not-
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.040]   I mean-
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.040]   The problem is when I go to Amazon to buy music, I want better than downloads.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.240]   I want to buy the actual CD and uncompressed audio.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.840]   Okay, uncompressed, unlocked, and I can re-rip it into any format that I want, not just
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.840]   MP3.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.480]   I just don't have any room.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.720]   I would submit that neither you nor Alex- I mean, if you're going to make your argument,
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.960]   neither you or Alex or the test case, the test case is the average, you know, 18-year-old
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.720]   idiot who just says, "Well, I just fly everything on iTunes."
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.560]   I think they're probably going to prefer the iTunes application.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.560]   I think the content-
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.560]   That's the-
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.560]   I agree with Andy.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.800]   But I think the content is fine.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.400]   256 is great.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.040]   You know, I think that that's not a problem.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.040]   Non-DRM is great.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.200]   I mean, what they're doing is great at Amazon.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.920]   It's just that, like for instance, I want to go buy louder than bombs by the Smiths.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.320]   It is painful for me to just get down to where I'm just looking at the Smiths compared
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.320]   to iTunes.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.520]   You know, and then I find out all they have is the first album.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.280]   It's literally two pages, Alex.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.440]   It's two pages.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.960]   It's two-
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.960]   It's two clicks.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   How is two clicks on-
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.960]   You hit the Smiths.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.360]   You hit the two clicks on iTunes.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.520]   It's a webpage.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.640]   You know, the thing is that it doesn't give you, you know, the thing is if I hit the Smiths
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.240]   on iTunes, I get in the top area, I see all the different things that are connected.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.240]   I click on that thing.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   I'm there.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.800]   I don't find, you know, the last time I went anyway, I just was like, "Oh, you know," and
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.000]   I couldn't explore anything and try to find something.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.280]   I mean, if I want something that's mainstream and maybe it's just that the search mechanism
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.160]   mixed with the fact that their catalog isn't full yet is just like I just keep on running
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.680]   into dead ends on Amazon one.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.240]   And I want it to be successful.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.600]   I want iTunes to have real competition.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   I just don't find myself going there very often.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:11.080]   My only point is that if you're going to look at a chink in Apple's armor, it isn't
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.800]   the iPod.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.040]   That device has a solid lock on it.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.840]   It's the fact that the content guys don't want them to be too strong and the content
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.800]   guys are going to do their best on their mind.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.160]   And Apple can't control that.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.120]   I don't think the content guys have to go to Apple.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.000]   That's where I disagree with your premise.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.120]   I don't think they have to go to Apple.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:38.120]   I think that the danger that they run into is that Apple has a kind of a latent possibility
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:43.240]   of really allowing more independent producers to monetize their work and if the world turns
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.240]   that switch on.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.880]   Yeah, but we've been talking about that for four years.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.880]   I know.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.800]   But the thing is, is that as this pressure keeps on building, if they allow that, they
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.840]   can do that, why couldn't Amazon do that?
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.600]   Amazon could do it, but I'm just saying that Apple has a vertical market.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:01.040]   If I can export out of Final Cut or out of Soundtrack or out of any of those things to
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.440]   direct into iTunes, you have all those tools and if you start feeding those tools straight
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.920]   into the app, and you can set up the whole thing.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:13.360]   I think you think that the department of justice comes after you for any trust violations.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.760]   I don't think they're too small.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:16.000]   It's too small of a market.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.320]   I mean, it's not they don't know.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.960]   Number two retailer now.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:24.560]   I also like to look at it as long as Amazon's there and as long as Walmart's there and as
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.200]   long as Netflix is there, it'd be tough to make that case.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.400]   Unless Apple's software automatically goes to the iTunes store and doesn't go anywhere
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.400]   else.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.720]   Apple's already got a problem with the fact that you buy stuff on the iTunes store.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.520]   You have to play it on an iPod.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.520]   They are not in the US.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:41.520]   No, they do have that problem.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.880]   Well, yeah, but that stuff's really gone anywhere.
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.800]   Also, you cannot buy not in the US and the E2.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   That's 80% of the market.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.120]   That's 80% of the market.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:54.000]   You cannot buy louder than bombs on either the iTunes store or Amazon.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   And for Dan and the other.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   I'm on the streets of London.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   I'm on the streets of London.
