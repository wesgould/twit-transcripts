[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   It's time for a Mac break weekly.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.000]   Andy and Renee are here.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   We're going to have our last chance to take a guess at what
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.540]   Apple's going to announce in two days.
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.440]   There is a big Apple event.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.400]   We think new Macs find out what that could mean and right
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.680]   in the middle of the show, the first leaked images
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.240]   of the new hardware.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.440]   So can I hear about that?
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.680]   We'll also talk about how portrait mode works.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.260]   And I think sometime during the show,
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.360]   Apple's quarterly earning results for Q4 will be out.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.680]   Renee will have his lightning fast instant analysis.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.920]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.280]   Hey, the band is back together again, kids.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.200]   Renee Richie has returned from his jot.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.320]   We had all sorts of theories.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080]   Did you come down here and get briefed?
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.560]   That's what I thought was going to be.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.360]   No, no.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   I had a meeting in New York that was very last minute
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.600]   that I had to get to.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.240]   And I couldn't arrange the travel that it matched up
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.840]   with the schedule.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.720]   I apologize.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.120]   No, no need to apologize.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.760]   But we sure miss you when you're not here.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.480]   Thanks for coming back.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.520]   Thank you, likewise.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.200]   We appreciate it.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.840]   No, so Andy Enaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.000]   It's Renee from iamore.com.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.080]   Andy's going to join us on Thursday
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.960]   as we do the live stream thing from the Apple event.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.240]   The Apple event invites went out.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.720]   And you got one Renee, I know.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.360]   I'm sure.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.680]   Yes.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.720]   So tell us about it.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.520]   So nobody thought there was going to be another event.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.480]   In fact, when they had the event last for the iPhone SE
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.720]   back in March, they made it sound
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.120]   like they were going to roll town hall, which is the Cupertino
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.600]   Infinite Loop Campus Auditorium, into mothballs afterwards.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.840]   And it was sort of the end of that era.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.600]   But you know, WWDC came and went.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.760]   And the iPhone event came and went.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.280]   We hadn't gotten you max yet.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.000]   So one more time doing an encore final presentation.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.600]   Hello again, which he'll hearkens back to the original Mac
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.120]   and the hello bracket again, bracket of the iMac.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.400]   Oh, that's right.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.680]   That's the first thing that the Macintosh said
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.640]   when Steve Jobs pulled it out of that bag.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.880]   Hello.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.400]   Hello.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.880]   Quick OK.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.920]   So play.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760]   Hello again.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.520]   Hello.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.360]   Hello.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.720]   Let's see a Dell now.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.600]   So interesting.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.160]   Do you think that?
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.120]   What does that mean, you think?
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.360]   I think it's tipping their hand that it's going to be a Mac
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.040]   centric event.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   I mean, some people would want iPads this time of year
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.080]   because the last previous October events, Apple did iPads
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.800]   alongside the Mac, but it sounds like iPads might be a--
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.640]   you never say never, but it sounds like that might be a spring
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.200]   thing.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.320]   And we'll most likely get the new MacBooks,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.920]   the 13 inch and 15 inch, and maybe a slightly larger MacBook,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.800]   the manager book MacBook.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   Actually, I will not be here.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.360]   It's always reminding me.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.560]   I'll be in Gainesville.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.880]   We're going out there to visit ITProTV.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.720]   They're having the grand opening of their new studio that day.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.520]   And that was planned a long time ago before Apple--
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.840]   because Apple waits the last minute.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.080]   It was a week ago that Apple--
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.000]   week and a day ago that Apple set out the invite.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.280]   So Andy, you're going to have to anchor with Megan.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.880]   And who else do we have, Carsten, doing that, do you know?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.400]   And Alex.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.840]   Alex Lindsay will be here.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.440]   So I'll be watching.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.760]   With Alex and Megan, I'm definitely
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.320]   the anchor that will bring everything down.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.080]   So that's a very appropriate to use the phrase.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.160]   Yeah, because-- well, and there's a funny story
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.960]   because Paul Therott and Mary Jofoli--
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.200]   I think it was Mary Jofoli who was telling me last week--
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.040]   that Microsoft wanted also to have an October hardware event,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.120]   but they obviously-- nobody, including Microsoft,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.000]   wants to have an event the same day as Apple's event.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.800]   You won't get any press.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.920]   But Apple doesn't say.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.960]   So they read the tea leaves, and the tea leaves
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.240]   were that Apple moved--
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.440]   correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.000]   They're an analyst call to today--
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.600]   Yes.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.760]   --from Thursday.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.480]   And so the tea leaves were, ah, that must mean they're
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.720]   thinking they're going to have an event on Thursday.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.240]   Right?
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.320]   Because you want to have the call before.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.400]   You've got an event on Tuesday and left the call on Thursday,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.440]   but it's better for them to get the call out of the way
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.440]   so that the call doesn't hit the news cycle
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.400]   after the product.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.920]   So that's what Microsoft's thinking.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.720]   So they said, all right, well, we don't want to be after the Apple
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.760]   event.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.920]   Let's do a Wednesday.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.800]   They kind of threw a dart at the calendar.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.920]   They picked Wednesday, and it worked out.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.000]   So I will be here.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   That's why I'm confused.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.080]   I'll be here tomorrow morning at 7 my time, 7 a.m.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.320]   for the Microsoft event in New York City.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.400]   Actually, I'll be at the event of the New York event tomorrow.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.480]   Oh, cool.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.040]   I did get an invite to that one.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.640]   I got a phone call for that one.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.320]   We're splitting coast and splitting duty.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.000]   It's a team.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.800]   Exactly.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.360]   Apple needs--
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.960]   Quad goals.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.400]   --twice about its strategy here.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.280]   Now, admittedly, this is probably the last one.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.640]   What is it?
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.200]   Town Hall, they call it in Cupertino.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.120]   It's also a brutal.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.800]   I feel bad for my colleagues who cover both,
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.600]   because they have to cover the Microsoft event,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.080]   do all their filing, get on a plane,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.160]   go all the way across the country,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.240]   get to Cupertino, do that, and then try to cover both.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.520]   It's not easy.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   And this is a small couple of hundred seat.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.880]   It's not huge.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.440]   You have the Town Hall, then you have the Piano Bar,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.960]   which is inside the media reception area,
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.840]   which is where they do the demos and things.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.760]   So they'll have a demo area.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.040]   They do have a demo area.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   Big enough space to go on.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.240]   Typically, yeah.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.800]   I think an upstairs for catering.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.200]   And so it's a kid at a place.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.960]   It's also a place where they have large, all hands meetings,
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.640]   because it will hold a couple hundred people,
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.280]   and it's a very controllable space.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.680]   I do believe the invitation said a cafe breakfast
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.600]   would be made available.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.440]   They typically do that.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.320]   I mean, for every company that I've been to a press event
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.160]   for this some form of--
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.640]   It's still Danish.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.640]   And coffee.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.480]   Actually, they have vegan wraps and things.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.960]   This is exactly what you'd expect from Apple.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.840]   Does Apple have better food at their events?
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.800]   I don't know about better.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.320]   I mean, usually the worst the company does,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.720]   the better their food budget becomes,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.920]   because they really want to get--
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.680]   It's like CES.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.880]   They really want to get people in there.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.240]   Apple need not lure anybody.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.280]   It's not the food they're showing up for.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.960]   No.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.280]   All right.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.120]   Let's talk about what we think they're going to--
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.360]   Announce.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.880]   And it seems like-- you correct me if I'm wrong--
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.200]   that the best information is currently coming out of KGI
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.720]   and Ming Chiquo.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.840]   And that's because he has access to the supply chain in China.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.240]   And--
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.560]   Yeah, once this stuff is being built, he's really solid.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.520]   That means you can keep leaks from ever coming out of Cupertino,
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.680]   but it's pretty hard to keep leaks coming out of China.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.320]   When there's millions of chassis coming off an assembly.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.280]   Somebody's going to snap a picture of it for a few thousand bucks.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.520]   So you're up on wayboat.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.400]   He says, although this is puzzling to me.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.960]   So I want you to clarify.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.680]   Refresh of the MacBook.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.520]   Not the air.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.360]   He says the air is gone.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.860]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.840]   But they're going to take the MacBook, which is currently
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.920]   in a 12-inch and do a 13-inch.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.280]   Is that going to be side by side?
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.160]   So it'll be a smaller and a larger MacBook.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.280]   Is that what you think?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.120]   Yeah, I believe so.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.520]   I mean, they did that with the MacBook Air.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.160]   They have the 9, and they have the 13-inch, which is admittedly
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.200]   a bigger difference.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.440]   And also the 9 is 16 by 9, and the 13 is 16 by 10.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.160]   So they're quite different screens than those.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.720]   But the MacBook for a while has been 13 and 15.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.640]   And Apple seems to like two screen sizes for every device.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.520]   And the MacBook-- and by that, again, I mean the manager book,
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.840]   the one that's very sleek and runs a core M processor
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.560]   and is just MacBook nothing at the end of it.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.520]   Red only has one size, and it was expensive enough
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.440]   to make it in that size that you probably
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.040]   want to introduce it the same way the original MacBook
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.080]   Air was introduced in one computer in that envelope.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.320]   And then as time goes on and the components become easier
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.600]   and you sort of validate that market, you add a second size.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.720]   And it doesn't sound like it's much of a difference.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.680]   And it's going to depend exactly on 12-point what
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.080]   and 13-point what.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.640]   But when you look at a 4.7-inch iPhone compared
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.360]   to a 5.5-inch iPhone, or even a 38 compared to a 42-millimeter
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.800]   watch, the difference can be noticeable when they're side
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.880]   by side.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.320]   But what makes a Mac--
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.320]   Go ahead, Danny.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.920]   OK, because you're talking about a diagonal.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.400]   So you're talking about one dimension times
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.040]   and other dimension in terms of screen area.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.040]   And yeah, it's also-- I think that also reflects the fact
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.520]   that a lot of people are really shifting a lot of their work
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   onto larger phones and tablets.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.200]   So there are a lot of people that are now looking
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.240]   at a 13-inch notebook and thinking, gosh, that's kind of big.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.400]   I wish they made a 9-inch notebook.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.200]   Maybe not that bad.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.600]   But this is-- I think the drive is to get smaller rather than
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.560]   to go to 15 inches.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.480]   And what distinguishes the MacBook from the MacBook Pro
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.760]   is weight, thinness size, essentially, right?
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.600]   Yeah, platform.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.760]   They're running Core M instead of Core 2.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   And I said, if it's a more mobile platform,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.920]   does that mean better battery?
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.240]   Well, no, because it's so small the battery can't be--
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.960]   Means no fan.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.520]   I mean, for Apple, this point of view is no fan.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.360]   You can run a Core M without a fan.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.880]   And probably a single Type-C connector, or will they--
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.720]   I think they're--
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.280]   They really--
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.280]   You think they'll splurge, Leah?
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.200]   You think they'll splurge and go for two?
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.480]   I'd love to see one on both sides.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.720]   That's what Google did with the Chromebook Pixel.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.880]   And that's just more convenient.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.380]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:03.880]   I see--
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.380]   I have no--
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.560]   I see the 12-inch was--
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.640]   I have no direct information.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.800]   But they got enough crap about the one port.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.880]   And also, it is enough of a sticking point.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.040]   There really is no solution around that one port that goes
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.640]   on to-- here's another piece of crap
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.960]   you have to put in your bag just to be able to charge it
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.440]   while-- have it powered up or recharging it
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.160]   while you're doing something else with a peripheral.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.320]   And it seems as though there is room in there
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   to put a second connector, given what we understand
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.800]   from the IFix who tearedown of what's on the--
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.840]   what's on the logic board.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.000]   It's not as though the controller there
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.280]   is set to support only one USB-C connector.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.600]   As long as they can get the cable routing,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.600]   as long as they can put it into place
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.200]   where it's not going to interfere with any of the other radios,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.160]   they can get it in.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.200]   And I think that that's going to be the thing that gets
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.800]   a lot of people who were very interested
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.440]   in the MacBook but were put off by the one port to say,
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.800]   yep, I'm glad I waited.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.960]   I'm definitely buying this one.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.600]   One thing you could do is take the headphone microphone jack
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.680]   out.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.520]   So the thing for me was that I think that regardless of--
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.960]   they deliberately did one port.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.680]   Now, you could think that they wanted to make a Mac that
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.560]   was as much like an iPad as possible,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.000]   or they really what Phil Schiller said,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.160]   they were all in on wireless.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.240]   And the port is the only concession to that
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.040]   because you still have to charge it efficiently.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.640]   And wireless charging isn't efficient yet, even if it does work.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.840]   So they had to have one port.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.880]   They might as well make it a universal port.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.960]   But they were all in on it.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.920]   This is an iPad in Mac closed, basically.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.240]   And it's embracing the wireless future.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.800]   But when you go bigger in size, you could say, yeah, well,
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.880]   we decided you wanted to bigger another port.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.680]   We're going to give you another port.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.360]   The headphone jack, again, it depends
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.560]   on how far they want to go in on this wireless world.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.160]   But this is designed to be that computer where it weighs
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.760]   almost nothing.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.080]   And it's the closest thing to a tablet
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.040]   that you can get that runs Mac OS.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.240]   And for me, the biggest sticking point was never the USB C
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.400]   thing.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.480]   I was flying with that because I've worked off a MacBook Pro
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.120]   and I was flying.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.280]   It's the core M processor.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.120]   I think until I don't think they're
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.440]   keeping up with things like what Apple's doing with the A10
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.600]   and what they're going to do with the A11 processor.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.880]   So for me, a bigger computer running that chip.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.360]   I hope it has a better solution for running, especially graphics
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.440]   and everything else off a larger version of that computer.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.040]   But we also can ignore the fact--
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.840]   sorry.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.800]   We also can ignore the fact that--
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.920]   remember that a couple of years ago, the MacBook Nothing was--
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.400]   it is the thing that nobody can possibly complain about
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.240]   because look, we are keeping the entire product line as it is.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.040]   We are simply adding this other thing.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.120]   If you think that this is a freakish thing that
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.320]   has way too many compromises to be practical,
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:35.840]   that's fine.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.280]   Don't buy it.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.840]   You still get your MacBook errors.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.240]   But it looks like we're angling closer and closer to the day
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.800]   where the MacBook Air is not designed
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.880]   to have all those radical engineering changes that
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.760]   are going to be necessary to give it the kind of display
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.920]   to fit in with anything else that Apple is making.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.720]   So clearly, the MacBook Air is close to end of life
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.600]   at this point.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.520]   And so we're moving into a world in which the MacBook Nothing
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.120]   will now have the place in the lineup of being that $1,000,
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.320]   $900 entry-level Mac, the one that when you walk into a store
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.120]   and say, I've got money, I will not tell you about my needs
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.800]   or my wants.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.000]   I will just simply say, I need to buy a notebook right now.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.600]   That's the default MacBook.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.920]   They will try to sell you.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.680]   And at that point, you don't get to get a coffee saying.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.080]   But let me show you this video.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.560]   It's a wireless world.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.000]   And we have to be prepared for it.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.800]   Then I say, yeah, that's bull.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.400]   I need more than one port on this thing.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.880]   So at that point, you really have
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.680]   to have an incredibly wonderful excuse not to put in
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.880]   at least a second port there.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.920]   So I would expect to see a doubling of ports.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.600]   All right, you heard it here first.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.880]   The interesting thing to me is that when the MacBook Air,
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.840]   the original one came out again.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.600]   It was expensive.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.400]   It was underpowered.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.720]   It had very few ports.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.480]   But when they introduced the second size,
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.840]   they went to the second design, the one that we still have now.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.400]   It was a major transformation.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.160]   And it let them go down to the prices that
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.880]   knocked the original MacBook off the menu.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.640]   And I was expecting them to sort of when
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.200]   they would go to the second size,
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.560]   they would go to the second version.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.760]   And it would get less expensive.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.920]   And it would be the same thing that knocks the MacBook Air out.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.120]   But it looks like they're willing to go to that second size
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.080]   much earlier than they were with the MacBook Air line.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.400]   I think that's super interesting.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.880]   This is good.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.400]   I like it.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.760]   And the air really is-- it's done.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.240]   I mean, it's the low-res screen alone, kind of,
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.120]   unless they were to make a retina display.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.800]   I think this will-- I think this makes sense.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.400]   Instead of a wedge, it's more-- it's thin, it's light.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.560]   And as you mentioned, no fan, slower processor as a result,
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.400]   but also lower price as a result.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.680]   So those are the factors that make the MacBook popular.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.480]   Now, let's move to the MacBook Pro,
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.400]   because we haven't had an update for a while.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.240]   I'm ready.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.480]   I'm-- this is a 2012 MacBook.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.040]   I'm pro.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.760]   I'm using here, 15-inch.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.760]   There will be a 13 and a 15.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.360]   By the way, this is a little bit confirmed,
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.280]   because Apple has now applied for trademarks in Russia
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.880]   for three new models, the 1706, 1707, and 1708.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.480]   No other information with the filing.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.200]   But when you file for three model numbers,
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.360]   that means three new SKUs.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.920]   And so the two other two would be presumably MacBook Pros.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.840]   What do we know about those?
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.520]   13 and 15 modern processors?
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.280]   Would they be Skylake or KB Lake?
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.120]   I mean, what are we?
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.320]   Skylake, right?
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.680]   It has--
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.360]   Apple is usually conservative with the processors,
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.600]   because people think they just buy stock parts
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.360]   and stick them in there.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.120]   But they don't-- they typically work very closely
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.000]   with Intel and do a lot of integration
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.320]   to get the features working the way they want them to.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.360]   And I think-- I don't think there's
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.680]   that much lead time on KB Lake.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.280]   I mean, you never know.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.920]   They could have been working on it secretly,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.400]   or at least behind the scenes for a long time and surprise us.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   But we're not really on Skylake.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.520]   Is that hurt a little bit?
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.800]   I mean, they could just say, well, we're
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.440]   going to skip Skylake over.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.120]   Haswell the KB Lake.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.720]   But does that hurt to release a machine with Skylake?
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.240]   Given that KB Lake is out?
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.840]   Piece you get a--
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.840]   No, I mean, Z-Laptop.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.000]   I wouldn't say so now.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.320]   No.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.520]   Because Mac people don't care.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.960]   Well, they don't care.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960]   And that's a good thing.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.120]   You also don't care what kind of USB control would trip.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.400]   You only care about why is it slow when I try to connect
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.360]   this sort of storage into this sort of storage.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.720]   So so long as Apple can make the case that here's
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.240]   how fast this thing actually cooks,
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.520]   no one's going to care whether it's
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.360]   because it's got the latest generation Intel processor
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.760]   or these next latest generation processor.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.080]   They can do things with the type of memory they're using.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.400]   They can do things with the data path.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.440]   They can do things with optimization.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.200]   They do things with code compression
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.400]   that nobody cares about the CPU.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.480]   They only care about how fast the damn thing is.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.360]   So long as this thing can cook, so long as they can make
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.800]   the typical MacBook Pro user happy.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.400]   And these are people who they're not willing to trade off.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.080]   These are not people who are willing to watch a new video
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.880]   about why it only needs one port.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.800]   They need this thing to be a workhorse.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.720]   They need this thing out plowing fields 10 hours a day,
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.160]   seven days a week.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.360]   And so long as they can deliver that level of performance
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.240]   with very few trade-offs, no one's going to care
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.480]   what number it is.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.320]   Maybe just PC.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.280]   The metric has changed.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.680]   PC buyers care about KB Lake and pay attention to that,
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.520]   mostly.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.360]   Because there are Acer's Acer, HP, Dell,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.560]   they all have KB Lake process.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.560]   And Intel works really, really closely with Microsoft.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.760]   A lot more closely than people really understand
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.160]   to develop, to make sure that their operating system works
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.080]   really well with the next generation of CPUs.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.560]   But all these makers, they really
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.640]   are A in the position where they can't really afford
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.080]   to put the kind of performance tuning into one specific model
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.840]   that Apple can put into their MacBooks
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.120]   because they are competing against 6, 7, 8, 9 different makers.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.400]   And that is one metric that a lot of people are looking for.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   They know that in the Windows world,
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.160]   it's a very, very important thing to say
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.640]   that this has the latest generation CPU,
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.760]   because that will be a distinction between an Acer,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.640]   and an Acer, and an HP, and two or three other models.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.480]   Apple is making the one MacBook.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.400]   That you can possibly buy.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.960]   If you don't want this MacBook, congratulations,
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.480]   you're now running Linux, or you're now running Windows,
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.160]   or next OS, whatever it is you're getting to run of that thing.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.360]   So it's not quite as important, but it is important,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.720]   on a Windows machine, that you have,
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.960]   you'll be able to at least say,
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.160]   this is the highest performance CPU that you can buy.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160]   And the metric has changed because in the old days,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.560]   it really was about pure speed.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.680]   And you would hear the companies talk about the speed
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.680]   and how many megahertz or gigahertz it was every year.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.480]   And now the metric has mostly become battery life and power.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.480]   It's gone from power to power efficiency,
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.160]   and what you hear is eight hours of battery life,
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.760]   or 10 hours of battery life.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.560]   And we're not getting the huge gains anymore,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.600]   and Intel chips that we use to like the speed differential
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.320]   between Broadwell and Haswell, and Skylake, and Kaby Lake,
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.680]   and Coffee Cake, or what a coffee lake,
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.120]   which I think is slid in between that,
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.760]   and Cannon Lake, which is after that.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.680]   You don't see as much speed, it's about the architecture,
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.360]   and about the power efficiency, and about other features.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.040]   And Apple's never cared about chipsets,
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.360]   they care about feature sets.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.280]   And if they're looking at things like Touch ID,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.800]   then the question's not how much faster was MacBook Go.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.880]   It's how on earth do we secure the fingerprint sensor
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.720]   to Intel, to the secure enclave, to Intel, to Mac OS.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.680]   And that's a much thornier problem to solve
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:23.480]   than whether it's 3% or 5% or even 10% faster anymore.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.280]   Kaby Lake also better power profiles, yes?
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.040]   And maybe I wouldn't be surprised to see a MacBook
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.080]   with Kaby Lake just for that, but maybe not, we'll see.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.040]   What the big changes, though,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.440]   are going to be mostly ports and cosmetics.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.640]   So let's talk, I think, have all heard the rumor about it.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.160]   Oh, yes, you disagree.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.280]   Well, no, and we'll not disagree,
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.880]   but also think about there has been a rumor
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.760]   that the super, super flat keyboards
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.800]   that's in the MacBook nothing,
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.400]   and the new keyswitch design they have,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.920]   they'll make that line wide.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.440]   So even if you buy a MacBook Pro, you will get that.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.360]   It's a rumor, it's something to be discovered.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.000]   I hope that's not true, I do not like.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.800]   And by the way, I don't even think it's a requirement
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   of the platform because, so that does, by the way,
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.880]   kind of confirm your theory, Andy,
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.560]   because they like these keys, and I don't like them.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.520]   I make lots of mistakes on the MacBook.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.560]   I have a HP Spectre 13, which is exactly the same thing.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.320]   Actually, it's a little thinner than the MacBook,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.040]   and it has full travel keys, and I much prefer it.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.840]   So I'll be very disappointed if the new MacBooks
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.440]   have that MacBook key.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.840]   Those are not great keys.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.520]   And is it just me?
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.360]   We'll wait.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.160]   Well, it's like Jim, we've talked about this
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.440]   with Jim Dallerable, and Jim loves the,
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.280]   I'm not going to speak for him,
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.080]   but I've heard him say that he loves the keyboard
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.920]   and his MacBook.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.680]   I mean, it's an objective thing from user to user to user.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.880]   I would, I mean, you've heard me say this time and time again.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.280]   It's not that I am opposed to a flat profile keyboard.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.480]   I don't like them myself, but it's not like
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.040]   I'm religiously opposed to them.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.920]   But I think that there has to be a reason why you gave me
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   that flat profile keyboard.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.880]   And if you, and if on Tuesday, excuse me, on Thursday,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.400]   if Tim is saying that this is the thinnest $3,000 laptop
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.440]   we've ever made, like I really don't care
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.520]   that you manage to get two more millimeters off the case.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.640]   'Cause it's, Apple just, for me, the one thing,
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.160]   the one thing that's kind of global about Apple products
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.120]   that I really worry about is that anything
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.080]   that is a controllable thing that you put your hands on,
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.080]   that is not a multi-touch thing.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.920]   Wow, they've got some form of my some blind spot
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.560]   right there because they don't design a mouse.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.480]   That's really good.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.680]   They don't design a remote control for the Apple TV.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.960]   That's really good.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.920]   And I think that that kind of a blind spot would lead them
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.600]   to say, and well, look, look how we designed the switch.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.080]   Look, we have numbers.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.120]   We have data that says that no matter where you hit
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.360]   the switch is beautiful.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.720]   The fact that people like, excuse me, that a lot of people
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.760]   like a keyboard with a little bit of travel, it's,
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.080]   I mean, I'll say this, and this is not an announcement,
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.880]   but it's something that kind of a chill ran up my spine
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.520]   when I had this realization three or four months ago
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.720]   that I finally, out of the blue, I had the realization
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.440]   that I can actually now imagine a scenario
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.560]   in which the next notebook I buy is not a MacBook
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.920]   and it's a Windows machine.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.880]   And it would be if Apple decides to go with this keyboard
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.680]   that I don't like line wide,
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.000]   and there is no way I can buy a MacBook
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   that does not have that keyboard.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.520]   And that at that point, I would say, okay,
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.840]   I got $1,500 to $2,000.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.520]   Let's see what Windows notebooks are out there.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.240]   And I would look at three or four candidates
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.960]   and there might be one with a really great keyboard
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.800]   that I really enjoy writing on.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.480]   Again, given that times I spent a minimum of four hours
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.080]   and a maximum of like 11 to 12 hours typing
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.160]   on this notebook, on this notebook,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.680]   it's such an important thing that they can't really
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.960]   cut any corners there.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.200]   They have to really give me a good keyboard.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.000]   And that's the thing that would send me,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I don't want, I don't prefer Windows to Mac OS,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   but I do prefer this keyboard.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.920]   And I can't tell my fingertips,
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.280]   but let's talk about security and privacy
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.400]   and software updates, but I don't care.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.400]   I hate how this feels.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.280]   - Yeah, usability is fundamental.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.840]   I mean, I think that's a fundamental thing.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.800]   And admittedly, you said it's subjective.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.480]   Some people like it.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.480]   You and I agree on that. - I don't think it's
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.640]   the end of the, I don't think it's the end of the evolution,
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.480]   either.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.320]   Like I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.480]   exactly the same as a MacBook,
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.360]   but better or at least they're next.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   - What is it that makes it?
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.600]   - I think it's the lack of travel that makes it
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.840]   inaccurate for me anyway.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.000]   I'm not sure why it's inaccurate for me.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.760]   - Again, like you like keyboard like the notebook.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.840]   - You don't keep it.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.600]   - Within five minutes, I can use almost any,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.560]   like I use the Mac, I move from iPad Pro
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.040]   to 13 inch MacBook Pro to the MacBook every week.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.680]   And I noticed a difference immediately on all of them.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.400]   Just one feels loose and slippery, one feels tight,
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.600]   one feels like they all feel different,
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.400]   but then within five minutes, I don't care anymore.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.200]   - I would like to pinpoint why I can't.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.960]   And you know, we're accuracy really matters to me
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.600]   as in passwords and I hate having to retight passwords
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.960]   'cause I mistyped and it happens to me
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.200]   all the time in the MacBook.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.080]   I do love this night. - I switch a lot too.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.640]   I mean, I bought like a really nice like mechanical keyboard
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.960]   last year and oh my God, do I love this.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.280]   - Right, I had one really good one for a while.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.120]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.960]   - Right.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.160]   And this is, I use the big brother version of this keyboard
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:34.080]   on my iPad, the Logitech K811,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.800]   which is actually better than the keyboard
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.000]   in my current MacBook.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.280]   So it's actually more comfortable to type on my iPad.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.440]   So it's not, I can switch from one to the other
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.240]   and there times where I actually will use a compact keyboard.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.720]   I'm thinking about going super, super lightweight tomorrow
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.800]   and taking just like my iPad mini
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.280]   and a super compact keyboard.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.640]   So I can switch from one to the other,
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.320]   but I don't like to be forced into,
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.960]   this is the only keyboard that we're gonna let you have.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.440]   And this is not something that you particularly like.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.160]   Again, it's great in the MacBook, nothing
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.400]   because you really do have to make trade offs
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   to make it that thin and get that much battery
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.720]   inside the damn thing.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.280]   So that's perfectly, that's perfectly great.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.760]   But we go back to the thing that I keep saying that,
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.960]   again, it's the scenario where I win one of those
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.120]   half a billion dollar power balls lottery.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.680]   I walk into the Apple store, I'm trailed by personal assistants
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.480]   or ordered to like have a wheel of barrel filled
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.680]   with bags of money at all times.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.480]   And I march into the Apple store and say,
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.360]   "I want the greatest MacBook you make.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.760]   Money is no object.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.840]   40, 50, 60, $100,000, I don't care."
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.000]   And they hand me this MacBook to, yeah,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.240]   but it doesn't have ports and the keyboard
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.600]   is really, really flat.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.280]   And yeah, but I said, I'll give you $100,000
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.240]   for the best one you can make.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.120]   And it's like, that's not really a,
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.120]   it doesn't really look like an impressive pro machine.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.040]   It looks like you took the MacBook Air,
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.920]   made it a little bit bigger, and let me upgrade the RAM.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.880]   - Oh, let's change the subject.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   - Yeah.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.160]   Function keys are gonna be, according to rumor replaced
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.280]   by an OLED screen.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.040]   That's, now correct me, Renee, if I'm,
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.320]   if you think this isn't what we're gonna see,
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.080]   but you, one gets the impression,
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.920]   if you put an OLED screen there,
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.400]   that it will be programmable,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.320]   that you will have function keys
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.680]   that are specific to the programs you're using.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.880]   And I like that idea.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.480]   - Yeah, I mean, it sounds like a long-term project,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.800]   like in a multi-stage project,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.920]   where they wanna make things more dynamic.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.040]   If you have an iPad, for a long time, since the iPhone,
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.360]   that keyboard could become anything.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.320]   It could change languages.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.920]   It could become numerical.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.600]   It could become a gamepad, anything.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.480]   But a physical keyboard, it can't change.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.960]   And you saw people complain a lot
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.560]   when the iPad Pro keyboard was available in US English
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.680]   for a long time, but not international.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.040]   And what do you do with a laptop?
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.240]   So part of that is you replace the function keys
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.760]   with this magic bar, or whatever the end of the magic strip,
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.240]   whatever they end up calling it,
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.800]   and that allows it to become dynamic.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.240]   So instead of just having like the F1 to the F8,
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.880]   or having the media controls and the brightness controls there,
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.320]   you can pull up context specific controls.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.640]   At first, you know, in the Apple apps,
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.600]   but they'll announce an API and developers will be able
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.600]   so the final cut will have theirs and Logic Pro
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.880]   will have theirs and Adobe will have theirs.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.040]   - Those are the apps that benefit the most of the Pro apps.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.440]   - Well, going forward, I mean, like the rumor is
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.000]   that this is gonna move completely to E-ink
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.120]   within two or three years on Apple's side.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.280]   And then the keys will be able to entirely change
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.440]   to the new one. - Oh, then, or any of that.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.080]   - It's really be upset.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.440]   (both laughing)
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.600]   - Well, that's interesting.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.600]   I mean, the new Yoga laptop that's a Windows 10 or Android
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.280]   that has a fully glass keyboard,
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.840]   that's an interesting contrast.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.920]   - It's interesting. - Particularly the,
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.200]   well, particularly that makes it,
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.240]   it makes it an interesting form factor that's totally different.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.000]   If you imagine that, yes, there will be a future version
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.400]   that has, it's actually multi-touch
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.800]   and has an actual OLED surface
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.160]   instead of just being a sheet of glass that you type on,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.080]   that's fascinating.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.240]   And especially if you have the idea of,
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.720]   remember that Microsoft concept book
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   that never made it, even though it looked great,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.960]   just having a folding book with two screens.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.280]   Thank you, I couldn't remember it.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   With two screens, like if you hold it this way,
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.960]   it can be a keyboard from, hold this other way,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.240]   it can be an actual book.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.560]   Hold it another way, you can have a two screen.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.160]   It's an interesting way to live.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.080]   And I hope that people start,
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   I hope that manufacturers start thinking big that way
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:20.920]   instead of just thinking,
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.720]   how can we get another a millimeter and a half
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.080]   off the case design?
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.720]   It's like, that's nice, but we can do better.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.400]   But I love the idea of a reconfigurable OLED strip.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.560]   That is such a brilliant idea.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.720]   Even if the first one we see is not quite as ambitious
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.000]   as some of the mock-ups we've been seeing in Mac blogs,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.480]   that could be just putting it there to say,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.000]   "Let's lock down, figure out how we can make this,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.400]   figure out how to make it durable."
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.840]   And then we will make this an Apple-only software feature
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.080]   at the beginning, and then we'll figure out
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.280]   what makes sense to allow developers to do with it,
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   because it's such a neat idea.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.720]   It's immediately compelling.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.920]   And you don't see it on other machines.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.120]   - The E-ink idea, I was assuming would be
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.960]   like a glass keyboard, it would just be an X screen.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.960]   - No, it would be a regular key.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.920]   - But it would be regular keys with E-ink.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.680]   - The caps would basically be changeable.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.640]   - Have changeable E-ink caps, yeah.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   - Yeah, that's intriguing too.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.800]   - Dr. Mob had an interesting point on the keyboard.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.400]   She says, " Older folks want more travel,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.280]   want more physicality, and are used to non-changing keys,
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.040]   'cause that's how we learned to type."
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.640]   But the younger generation is much more comfortable
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.920]   with the idea of these short travel keys, E-ink on keys.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.600]   - I like it 'cause my RSI likes it better.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.280]   Like I just like gravity do all the work.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.680]   I've got too many injuries.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.000]   I don't even click the keyboard anymore.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.040]   - So that will be the most, if that,
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.800]   and I like your name, what is it, Magic Toolbar?
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.240]   - Magic strip or Magic Bar, I mean,
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.120]   they've been a trademark, Apple's fired.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.720]   And you never know because they can change their mind
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.760]   up until they announce it.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.840]   - But they have the Magic Trackpad and the Magic Bar,
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.120]   that's the Magic Bar makes a lot of sense.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.480]   And that cosmetically, and I think this is something
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.240]   that Apple would absolutely consider, makes it distinctive.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.640]   And you know, and you look at it, you go,
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.920]   "Oh, that's the new MacBook."
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.240]   You need something like that.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.280]   You really want something like that,
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.760]   and they haven't had something like that in a while.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.200]   - Well, that's the thing too, is that all their designs,
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.880]   like every ultra book looks like a MacBook Air,
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.520]   a lot of bigger computers look like MacBooks now.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.360]   - Yeah, nothing distinct.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.200]   - And to them, it's just not interesting
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.040]   to just do a spec bump anymore.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.640]   They always want every few years from MacBooks
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.760]   to be bleeding edge again.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.320]   - Yeah.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.560]   So there also is the port issue.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.240]   What ports Renee do you expect at this point?
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.080]   - USB-C/ Thunderbolt 3,
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.720]   'cause they have the same interconnect.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.680]   - And you get that, you know, you get Skye,
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   like Chip set gives you Thunderbolt 3.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.000]   - Yeah, it doesn't do this way.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.920]   - Are we gonna eliminate the SD card reader?
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.760]   - I hope not.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.160]   I mean, I still find it useful.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.040]   I know people can put a little dongle in there,
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.480]   but actually I take that back.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.800]   I found it useful up until I got an iPhone 7 Plus,
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.240]   and I haven't taken my DSLR out since.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.440]   But I think when you have a Pro machine,
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.840]   people expect those kinds of features.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.920]   - Yeah.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.520]   I like having an SD card reader.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.120]   I really do.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.680]   - Yeah, and that's one of the reasons
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.440]   why you carry around a larger machine,
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.320]   fewer in-fue or inconveniences.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.560]   So I hope these, this might be cont...
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.960]   I don't know if they'll come through with this,
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.040]   but I hope they find a way to retain on the MacBook Pros,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.880]   at least one full-sized USB 3 connector.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.640]   Because again, if you're stuck without a USB 3.0
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.120]   to regular dongle, wow, are you screwed?
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.200]   And that's such a...
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   It's basically coming up with a new light bulb standard,
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   where I know it's amazingly better,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.920]   it's more compact, it's great for LEDs,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   it's great for addressability,
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.600]   but you need a light bulb.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.240]   Here's, you've got a million light bulbs
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.080]   that will fit in there,
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   you don't want to go out and get an adapter
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.000]   when you're sitting in the dark.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.200]   - I can see USB dash courage t-shirts already.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   - And use the Type C instead of a magsafe.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.000]   - Yeah, I think, again, like Andy's played that
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   really well last time.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.320]   - Save the space.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.800]   All right, this is all exciting.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.880]   Somebody's asking the chairman,
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.720]   this is an interesting question.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.000]   Does the OLED work before the OS boots,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   or does it work?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.880]   Probably not, right?
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.040]   It's probably just a dark strip
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.840]   until you're up and running.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.520]   - I'd be shocked if they didn't have
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.160]   as part of the bootloader,
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.960]   some sort of flourish that happens in that display.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.360]   I really think that as designers
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.760]   and as people who like to do things
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.640]   that are cool and delight people,
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.920]   the idea of just having this beautiful little transition
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.520]   that comes up and simply says,
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.920]   "Welcome, what a great place to put,
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.520]   "welcome to Macintosh that disappeared a while ago."
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.680]   - Hello again.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.240]   - The interesting thing for me too,
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.560]   is what are they gonna do for graphics?
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.000]   'Cause right now there's Intel integrated iOS graphics
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.960]   and all the MacBook Pros,
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.000]   except for the very, very highest end 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   And that has an option for an ATI Radeon card.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.120]   Some people really like to discrete graphics,
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.160]   and there's been rumors for a while
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.000]   that Apple's been working with AMD,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.480]   and I keep forgetting, it starts with a V
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.200]   with the name of their new graphics platform is.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.840]   But I'd like to see something really,
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.640]   because graphics are becoming increasingly important
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.000]   in all the operating systems.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.280]   - Yeah, GPU, yeah.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.280]   And not just for Pros,
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.920]   although the MacBook Pro is a pro model.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.760]   And frankly with Apple,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.960]   according to Ming Chi quote,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.140]   putting off updates on the iMacs till next year.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.880]   And nobody said anything about a Mac Pro
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.720]   in a while, like three years.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.560]   - Yeah, iMacs are interesting
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.200]   because iMac already has like everything,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.880]   like I also like, I would like P3
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.120]   to be in the MacBook Pro display,
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.920]   'cause once you get used to a P3 display,
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.080]   and I have it on this iMac,
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.240]   I have it on my iPad Pro,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.600]   and it makes it 5K and then.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.200]   - You wanted, well the P3 is a wide color gamut.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.280]   - Oh, the gamut, the gamut, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.520]   - Yeah, I just want that everywhere now,
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.240]   because it makes the rest look dull.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.600]   That's the worst thing about technology
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.200]   is it instantly makes your brain adapts to the new immediately
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.920]   and thinks the old is garbage right away.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.720]   And having that kind of stuff is great,
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.040]   and that all needs like the graphics and things to drive it.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.160]   - In fact, that's the other rumor.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.000]   - Oh, that's all right, yeah.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.720]   - We've been talking about it,
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.320]   cheap Mac, it was gonna just go ahead.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.600]   So I was gonna say with the iMac,
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.560]   there's a couple of challenges there.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.760]   One is it's already 5K, it's already got a P3 display,
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.160]   and Intel didn't even make a chip,
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.600]   that an integrated graphics chip
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.280]   that would go in the 21.5 inch iMac last year.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.360]   So what they do with that,
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.160]   you know, the 27 inch is Skylake,
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.520]   the 21.5 inch is still on Broadwell.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.200]   So that's an entirely different story.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.240]   And the Mac Pro makes zero sense,
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.880]   but when you look at what Intel does with Zions,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.120]   and when you look at what chip foundries are,
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.080]   when you make mobile chips,
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.360]   that's a real lucrative business.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.800]   And you start making one-offs
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.360]   for very small batch computers.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.400]   That's not always what a factory
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.040]   wants a dedicated fab to.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.520]   So I understand it's nothing that's not forgivable
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.800]   that you sealed it as an appliance
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.480]   and that you haven't updated it in three years.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.560]   But it just feels like time, like they have to do it.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.960]   They have to just bring that thing out of model.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.800]   - They do it Thursday.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.240]   - I hope so, I mean, they're either cut it off or improve it.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.520]   - And do you agree that the iMacs won't be this,
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.920]   it won't be Thursday that they'll be later.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.320]   Actually, I'm running into the same,
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.840]   the chat was reminding me,
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.960]   confusion when Mingchi Kuo says next year,
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.880]   he might mean next fiscal year, which would be,
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.720]   now, right?
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.560]   We're in the fourth quarter.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.400]   - November, December.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.800]   - Yeah, November, December.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   So do you think he means that?
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.640]   Or do you think he means that?
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.480]   Or do you think he means 20?
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.480]   I think he means 20, I think he's saying 2017.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.560]   - They've done it in October for the last two years.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.360]   So, and again, it just depends on what they do.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.800]   If they spec bump it, like,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.000]   are the chipsets ready that they would need to put
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.840]   in those iMacs?
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.280]   That means KB like the big one
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.240]   and whatever they figure out to do with a small one.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.560]   - Right, that's what's holding it up.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.400]   And then, of course,
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.040]   that long rumored cinema display with a GPU,
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.480]   the 5K cinema display.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.240]   - I want it so badly.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.160]   - What would you attach it to,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.600]   your iMac is a second display?
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.160]   - Maybe, yeah, I think once you have that 5K display,
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.520]   it's hard to have anything that doesn't match.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.160]   And also, I have a Thunderbolt display in my other room.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.600]   Like, I have a standing desk in the other room,
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.640]   like this one, and it just has the Thunderbolt display.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.600]   And I plug my MacBook in there when I want to work.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.080]   And I have, you know, I'm either I'm cooking
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.240]   or I have people over,
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.360]   and I don't want to be sequestered off in the studio.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.040]   I'd love the idea of taking that new MacBook Pro home,
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.480]   plugging it in and suddenly having that
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.320]   be the equivalent of a 5K iMac.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.560]   - Yeah, the MacBook Pro docks so nicely.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.840]   You don't need a dock in effect,
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.440]   especially with a Type-C connector in Thunderbolt.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.400]   It's under about three.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.960]   That would be a nice thing just to come sit down,
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.040]   plug one cable in,
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.240]   and not only have a keyboard, a monitor, a mouse,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.920]   but you also could have driver rays
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.120]   and all sorts of other Thunderbolt devices.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:26.960]   - They're back up strong.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.160]   - Everything can just be connected.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.000]   - That's a trick.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.480]   - A lot of the math has changed in the past two or three years.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.200]   I mean, I spoke about thinking about it all.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.080]   If it's possible, my next notebook will be a Windows machine,
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.880]   but it's also possible that I will,
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.560]   the next time that I need to spend $1,500 to $2,000
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.160]   on new hardware, it will be,
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.920]   well, I'm actually using my iPad Pro for everything
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.040]   that I used to use the MacBook for outside the house.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.480]   Why don't I put that money into an absolutely top
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.960]   of the line Mac mini or an iMac
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.080]   and just basically stay with the iPad
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.040]   as my outside the house sort of device.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.400]   - That's interesting.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.520]   - And there might be people who just,
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.800]   who simply decide that they will have the wonderful
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.840]   like sort of transition where like,
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.800]   you know, they'll finally,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.000]   your seven year old iMac will finally go
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.480]   to that land of ghosts and winds and they'll say,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.400]   okay, well, next month I'll buy a camp bite
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.760]   this month, I'll buy it next month.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.480]   And then they spend the next month
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.560]   suddenly realizing that, oh, it turns out
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.040]   that I don't really need a desktop at all.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.000]   And so they, that becomes a set of being really important
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.280]   that Apple keeps coming up with really great desktops.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.520]   That's what kind of drives people into realizing that
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.280]   the outlandish amount of money they spend on a tablet
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.600]   is going out coming back to them
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   in the form of greater usability.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.600]   - Well, we'll find out.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.360]   It's not too far off to after tomorrow.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   - We begin our coverage at about 9.45 AM Pacific.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.920]   That's about 12.45 PM Eastern time.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.760]   It should be very interesting to see.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.440]   - So excited. - Apple announces, yeah.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.400]   How about availability?
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.840]   Will I be able to buy it that day?
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.320]   Oh, and the AirPods too, right?
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.160]   That's gonna be presumably they'll say,
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.200]   okay, we've got them now.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.720]   - I mean, I suppose, I'm not gonna spoil my pick of the week,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.400]   but I mean, it's this week they said end of October
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.680]   and I haven't heard anything otherwise.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.520]   - What else are you gonna do it?
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520]   All right.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.600]   And then how about the laptops?
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.200]   I'd love to get a new MacBook sooner than later.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.160]   - They, I mean, oftentimes, like when the WWDC,
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.240]   when they've announced previous versions of the laptops,
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.720]   and I think even at some of the March events,
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.880]   it's just been available now.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.720]   You know, that's been, it's been different then
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.640]   with the pre-orders and the lining ups and things for,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.280]   for the iPhone lineup.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.720]   So I wouldn't be surprised to,
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.240]   two things with my head.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.120]   It depends on how hard all of this stuff is bound
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:46.960]   by the logistics.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.600]   It depends on how hard it is to make them
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.280]   and how many that they can ship.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.120]   So if they have availability in stores,
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.360]   if they manage to produce enough of them,
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.440]   they'll just say, go to your Apple store and buy them.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.560]   If they're constrained the way that the Mac Pro was,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.760]   when it first came out,
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.600]   then it could probably be,
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.160]   we're starting to ship them, you know, at X-Date
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.560]   and we anticipate to have, you know,
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.040]   enough of them in place by the holidays.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.400]   - That's the question.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.840]   Are the holidays important for a product like this?
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.160]   I mean, do they need to get them in the store by,
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.680]   I mean, if they, if the holidays are important,
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.880]   then they need to make them available pretty darn quick.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.920]   We're almost there.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.480]   - Are they important?
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.640]   Do they still want more Macs Christmas?
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.840]   - My understanding is still that you need to have new hardware
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.080]   by April or May when people start making buying decisions
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.280]   for the end of the year, right?
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.120]   When corporate's basically,
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.760]   corporate's a proven purchase orders.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.280]   I don't really think there are a whole lot of people
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.560]   who are getting these high end machines for Christmas.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.040]   - No, it's gotta be back to school.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.560]   - At corporate purchasing, it's gotta be like spring and summer.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.320]   At this point, it's too late.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.160]   You're not.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.640]   - Yeah, but there's still a psychological thing.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.480]   Like if Apple doesn't announce it, then it's like,
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.680]   "Oh, Apple didn't even get a computer out this year."
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.280]   And usually they want at least to have something there.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.640]   Some people say. - Oh, how long have we been saying that?
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.480]   - Yeah.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.160]   - I mean, you'll see people on both of them arrive in January.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.000]   - Apple's showing remarkable patience
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.440]   more than its customers in terms of getting computers.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.120]   - I don't think it's, yeah, it's not entirely.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.560]   This is the thing is like,
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.400]   they would love to have these computers.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.680]   I mean, in a perfect world,
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.400]   these would have all shipped at WWDC.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.000]   And it's, I know it's like customers count more
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.360]   than anybody else, but Apple, everyone from Apple retail,
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   to the Mac team, just they want to sell these computers.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.200]   - It's just supply chain-ish.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.600]   It's just an issue of supply chain.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.840]   And we can't predict that 'cause we don't know.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.200]   - And again, they do with so much integration
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.920]   that could be anything, any delay on Intel's part,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.480]   any delay on AMD's part, any delay with any of the,
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.320]   they all become steam, they just snowball from there.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.080]   - John, as you know, I'll be in Gainesville, Florida
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.320]   on Thursday, but you have my permission to buy anything
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.240]   and everything.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.720]   (laughing)
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.240]   The minute it's available.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.080]   - Antilio.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.320]   (laughing)
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.160]   - Let's take a break.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.200]   We have lots more to talk about,
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.240]   including fourth quarter results coming out.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.000]   What, in about 45 minutes, something like that?
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.480]   An hour?
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.320]   Hour and a half.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.320]   - We're stuck in this with a press release
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   and then the conference call is an hour and 15.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.200]   - So if I make this commercial long enough,
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.320]   maybe when we come back.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.040]   (laughing)
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.280]   Our show, they brought to you by hover.com.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.120]   We love hover.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   I still am a huge hover fan.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.400]   Recently, Steve Gibson, I thought this was very telling.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   He was wanted to move off of one of the old school
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.040]   domain registrars.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.760]   This is a company that registers domain names for you,
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.120]   so you can buy a domain name.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.400]   And, you know, 'cause it was time.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.320]   I had done this years ago, but Steve, you know,
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.840]   he moves a little slower than the rest of us.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.360]   So he asked on Twitter, he said, "What do you recommend?"
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.840]   He looked at all the different companies,
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.160]   he ended up going with hover.com,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.640]   and he's been very, very happy.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.120]   I have two, but there is some urgency
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.280]   in getting that perfect domain name.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.520]   Over 100 million.com domain names are already registered,
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.340]   and a new domain name is registered every second.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:56.680]   So if you're looking for a.com, and let's face it,
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.080]   that's the one people assume.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.800]   If you say, you know, I'm Joe's Plumber,
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.600]   they don't think Joe's Plumber.info,
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.000]   dozeplumber.biz, they think.com, right?
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.960]   I know with a dick, every time I tell everybody
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.960]   dick's website, gizwiz.biz, I have to explain,
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.120]   is.dotbiz.com, it's.dotbiz.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.720]   Get the.com when you think of an idea, register it,
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.640]   and the nice thing about hover is it is as easy as can be
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.840]   to buy a domain name.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.360]   And incredibly simple, there's no page after page
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.680]   of add-ons you have to opt out for,
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.520]   like those other guys, all of our cells
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.600]   is domain names and email.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.760]   So boom, and of course, who is privacy,
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.040]   which we know everybody wants is automatic,
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.880]   and part of the deal.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.320]   So they don't have to give you an extra check.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.360]   - Now, do you wanna hide your domain name?
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.880]   - No, it's built in.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.080]   Once you find the domain, use hover connect,
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.120]   and you'll set it up automatically with your website
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.120]   and a few clicks.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.200]   I've never found it easier.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.480]   You know, I use Squarespace, it's so easy
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   to make Squarespace and hover work.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.200]   - Is that Mark Frauemfelter?
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.040]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.560]   Boing, boing, right in the middle of there.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.200]   Look at that.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.240]   You can also use hover connect to get a more
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.320]   on-brand or professional email address,
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.240]   which is absolutely the case.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.640]   If you're still at AOL.com,
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.440]   Joe's Plumbing@AOL.com or Joe's Plumbing@Yahoo.com,
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.960]   no, no, no, no, no.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.920]   (laughs)
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.800]   It's gotta be Joe at Joe's Plumbing.com.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.320]   That's what you want.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.240]   And if you already have multiple domains on other providers,
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.640]   like Steve did, it's easy.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.040]   You can save money by bringing them all
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.400]   to hover with volume discounts.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.160]   The more domains you have, the more of a discount
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.080]   you automatically get.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.520]   They automatically, they will even move it for you
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.360]   if you want.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.480]   They've got a concierge service that's great.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.440]   And they're famous for, as they ought to be,
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.920]   there's no wait, no hold, no transfer phone service.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.320]   When you call hover, you get a real live,
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.980]   nice Canadian person.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.760]   And they'll talk to you and they'll get you,
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.080]   their problem solved without putting you on hold.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.320]   And I love that.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.760]   Let me show how easy it is.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.480]   Once you're in hover, this is my hover interface
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.800]   for freeloport.com.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.720]   I am, I'm preserving this 'cause someday
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:11.320]   I may be arrested and I will wanna raise money
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.000]   for my defense with freeloport.com, right?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.240]   That was my thinking when I registered this.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.240]   Automatic renewal, yeah, it's on.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.280]   So I don't have to worry, I'll get it automatically renewed.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.040]   Let's see, I've had it since 2014.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.640]   Transfer lock, that's nice.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.120]   But see how easy it is to turn that off?
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.120]   You just check a box.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.840]   Who has privacy on?
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.080]   They've got simple DNS editing.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.560]   Couldn't be simpler.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.880]   I just, I'm a big fan.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.400]   Hover, H-O-V-E-R.com.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.840]   Find a .com name for your idea.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.800]   And if you use the promo code MAC Break at checkout,
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.160]   you'll save 10% off your first purchase.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.560]   Here's the new Hover Connect feature, which I really like.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.560]   Makes it so simple if you're using one of these sites
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.760]   to apply, you know, so let's say your photographer
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.480]   and use 500px, push the button
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.560]   and you'll get your myphotography site.com
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.240]   hooked up with 500px.com.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.680]   As easy as pie.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.920]   And these are all of the different medium
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.600]   and square space and tumbler and weebly and zibbit.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.080]   (laughs)
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.680]   I don't know what zibbit is, but I like the name.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.720]   Anyway, easy peasy.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.480]   You can also get hover email, affordable.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.120]   I use hover email for myleoville.com
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.280]   and it's the best way to do it.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.400]   And of course, if you wanna get in the nitty gritty,
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.680]   their domain name editor is as easy as can be.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:38.520]   And I do this all the time when I've got forward to seven.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.320]   So if you wanna do it by hand, you know,
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.720]   if you've done it, you'll look at this and go,
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.600]   oh yeah, you just add a new filter, no problem.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.800]   You'll let's say we wanna add a C name, boom.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.560]   And it couldn't, you know, boom, boom, boom,
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.320]   paste it in, say save, you're done.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.680]   10% off with the use Z offer code MACPRAKE.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.120]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:02.040]   We all are hover.com.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.480]   It's your dot com today.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.960]   Andy, I wanna thank you, by the way.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.000]   I always buy Andy's recommendations
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.680]   and you recommended the E-cam right before I left for my trip.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.600]   And this was great.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.520]   I bought the package with the selfie stick.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.200]   I'm a very nice thing. (laughs)
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.160]   But it was great.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.600]   I used it all the time.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.040]   And the 4K video is...
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:22.880]   - Yeah.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.120]   - The only problem with it is so high quality
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.680]   that when I imported in the Lightroom,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.480]   I have to use Premiere or Final Cut to edit it
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.840]   because Lightroom's just a chokes on it.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.200]   'Cause it's such high bandwidth video,
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.120]   but it looks great.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.920]   Oh man, does it look great.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.320]   So thank you for the foundation.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.320]   Yeah, this is a nice, I carry it now, my verse.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   Exactly, it's part of my daily carry now.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   Lovely to have.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.240]   - Looks like Renee and I both saw the same thing.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.920]   - Breakthrough, right through.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.640]   - Bulletin, Bulletin.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.480]   This is from Mac Rumors, Julie Clover writing.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.560]   Just came out minutes ago,
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.760]   images of new MacBook Pro with Renee Ritchie.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.800]   - The Mac Magic Toolbar.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.160]   - And apparently it's in Sierra 10.12.1.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.520]   That's weird, isn't it?
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.360]   - What can we do? - Do you have to do this
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.280]   from this?
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.040]   - Oh look.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.880]   - Oh, it's just like the renders.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.800]   - Fingerprint. - Also, fingerprint.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.120]   - We see we're seeing a screen that says Apple Pay
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.200]   and maybe Touch ID.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.800]   - Yeah, no, Touch ID is the biggest thing here.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.000]   And that's what I was talking about
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.200]   in terms of the integration.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.600]   - Oh.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.040]   And it's right on the Magic Toolbar.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.280]   There's a little arrow.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.440]   - It says Touch here.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.960]   Oh, now I'm ready. - That's really
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.000]   to pay Apple and put to pay Apple
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.320]   than the dollar amount. - Nice.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.120]   - With a cancel button at the other end of the OLED bar.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.960]   Look at that.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.360]   - When you look at the features that they announced,
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.840]   like everything from the watch unlocked,
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.040]   you pay with Safari using your iPhone, Touch ID.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.320]   Those are all, even the Siri stuff,
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.320]   those are all sort of to support legacy MacBooks
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.200]   because if nobody had access to any of that stuff,
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.840]   they'd be super bummed when the new MacBooks came out.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.400]   The only thing I'm still wondering is at what point
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.560]   do they get beamforming mics?
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.280]   So you can do a bunch of that,
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.120]   Hey, Yo Jimbo sort of action on that as well.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.640]   - That'd be nice too.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.280]   Notice, is this me or is this the case?
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.640]   This looks narrow.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.160]   See how narrow those speakers are on the side?
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.240]   This is obviously the 13.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.080]   - Yeah.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.280]   - It's just slightly wider than the keyboard itself.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.720]   Does that seem right?
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.400]   - Yeah, and there's supposedly Apple images.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.800]   - Yeah, these are come from Sierra.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.640]   So. - Yeah.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.480]   - Basically, yeah.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.640]   The push here is that there's instructions
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.080]   on how to use touch ID that includes a look at
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.040]   what appears to be a MacBook nothing.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:35.880]   - Yeah.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.040]   - So I don't know if it's MacBook Pro.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.160]   - No, this says Pro.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.000]   - This is Pro.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:39.840]   - Oh, just say Pro?
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.680]   - Oh, oh.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:42.000]   - We're literally seeing this like three minutes ago.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.400]   - Yeah, it just came out.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.160]   Both of these are Pro's.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.000]   - Yeah.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.440]   - So that would be a new speaker grill.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.280]   - Smaller.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.720]   - Speaker grill to the left and right of the machine.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.960]   Don't know what, oh, okay.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.880]   I thought it does look like a flatter MacBook nothing style
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.720]   keyboard.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.040]   Given the given the spacing between keys.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.480]   I could be wrong, but it's also not.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:04.480]   - It's also not old.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.320]   - It's me.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.520]   - Oh, it's crap.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.200]   Well, I'm comparing what I'm seeing here to my actual
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.560]   the MacBook Pro I bought like this time last year.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.880]   And those are, those keys are definitely space,
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:19.320]   excuse me, the size of the keys are definitely larger
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.600]   with narrower gaps between them.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.120]   And it looks like they're dished slightly like
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.640]   the MacBook nothing keyboard.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.640]   - What do you have a 13 or 15 Andy?
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.480]   - I have a 13.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.880]   - Does this speaker grill narrower than it is on the current
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.200]   13?
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.000]   - Feels like there is.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.600]   - I think the 13 has the same.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.200]   - Yeah, don't have these.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.680]   This is the 15 inch has these.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.200]   - I would show you, but I would have to understand.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.600]   But I'm sure there's still some pictures up on the apple
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.360]   side of the current 13.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.920]   I mean, it looks physically narrower, but I don't know
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.240]   if that's because if that's an optical illusion,
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.280]   because it might be larger keypad.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.360]   - You're limited by the screen and this bezel doesn't look
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.520]   particularly smaller.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.320]   So it must be just, or these are wider keys.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   - Oh man.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.120]   - I'm sure the magic keyboard.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.080]   - Remember, magic keyboard.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.480]   - Remember the magic keyboard actually has larger keypad.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480]   - Right.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.400]   - It's a magic keyboard, a magic toolbar,
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.320]   magic fingerprint reader.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.600]   - If that's true, that's disappointing.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.080]   Deeply, deeply disappointing.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.000]   Maybe we'll get used to it.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.880]   Maybe it'll have better travel.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.920]   - See that again, it could be the most thing.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.520]   Not the same thing.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.160]   - Well, I won't go into a third time.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:33.800]   It's just that I would scare me to go to the whiteboard
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.320]   and come up with a list of things about every Apple product
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.040]   I've recently bought, where I have to say,
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.640]   well, maybe I'll get used to it as opposed to
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.960]   this is exactly what I want.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.160]   This is perfect for my needs.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.080]   And I don't know.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.240]   - Well, if you're gonna dock it.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.240]   - The next two of your brand new 5K GPU display,
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.920]   you just use a nice full travel keyboard
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.680]   like the one you've got there with the Cherry-C.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.640]   - I stopped using the LEI with that 5K display so badly.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.400]   - Well, also, you'll just go to the Apple.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.720]   I mean, if you're really a keyboard buff,
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.240]   you'll just go buy like an Apple keyboard
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.280]   that has an oh, wait, no, it also has the crappy flat key.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:09.320]   - Like, so the Apple, is this like the IBM Selectric?
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:13.120]   - I do think really that Touch ID and a laptop is,
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.160]   I think Touch, I won't buy a phone
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.600]   that doesn't have Touch ID now.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.440]   You've got to have that.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.280]   - I don't know how they're securing it.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.120]   That's gonna be the,
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.280]   and I can't wait for security now
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.560]   when they eventually publish a paper on it.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.960]   But I would love to know how they're securing
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.480]   the reading of the fingerprint to a secure enclave
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.440]   through the hardware channel and into macOS
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.920]   'cause macOS is not as locked down as iOS,
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.760]   but that has to be absolutely locked down.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.280]   So that's to me, it's gonna be one of the most fascinating
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.120]   stories here.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.440]   - Nice.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.640]   - Really, but remember that there's a kind of a different
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.280]   set of rules here because right now we are unlocking
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.800]   our, unlocking our Macs by typing in a passphrase.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.240]   And that's so super weak by guessing it
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.480]   and people who write it down and stick it somewhere.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.760]   So I'm sure that Apple didn't compromise the security,
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.280]   but I'm sure that they factored in that there might be
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.680]   a different set of rules for something that is not,
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.520]   it's not gonna likely to slip out of your pocket
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.720]   and you leave it behind on the subway.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.680]   - Now I have this huge dilemma.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.640]   Do I wanna use my Apple Watch to unlock
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.720]   or my fingerprint leave?
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.880]   'Cause I have both options now.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.800]   It's too many choices.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.720]   - I still can't, by the way, use my Apple Watch to unlock.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.400]   - I thought, oh, it was a bug.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.680]   Somebody said, tweeted to me, oh, no, the new update
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.160]   to Sierra fixes that, didn't.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.120]   And it's because I reset my security questions
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:31.640]   and it's not a three day hold, it's a 30 day hold.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.560]   - Mine was three days, I don't know how you fell,
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.640]   I don't think you can tell how fella fella fella
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.800]   - I don't know how you were 30 day.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.640]   - But I still can't.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.960]   - The British's character alerts.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.640]   - I won't be able to till election day.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:45.000]   But that seems to me a massive security flaw because,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.360]   well, I understand,
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.400]   I understand a hold and I understand a three day hold.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.880]   That doesn't seem unreasonable in case a hacker
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.120]   gets your account and tries to change all this.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.440]   But the 30 days, what if I'm putting
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.480]   trying to put two factor on here because I'm being hacked
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.320]   or being attacked?
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.360]   - Now I have to wait 30 days,
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.120]   that just gives the attacker 30 days to do it.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.600]   - You can always call them, I mean,
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.880]   they're pretty good about that kind of stuff.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:09.880]   - Yes, yeah, maybe I should call them.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.440]   I don't care that much.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.440]   I will be buying the new MacBook, so at that point,
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.360]   it'll be okay.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.560]   Now, let us talk about the quarterly results.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:26.560]   Some are saying that this will be the first annual revenue
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.040]   decline since 2001.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.560]   Is that a big deal?
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.560]   - Don't, don't, don't.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.120]   - It's a big headline.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.320]   - I mean, when you're making so much money,
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.920]   month over month, quarter over quarter, year over year,
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.240]   at some point you will not,
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.320]   and remember the iPhone growth was astronomical,
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.160]   they were selling more iPhones every year
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.600]   than they sold all previous years combined,
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.040]   and at a certain point you run out of,
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:51.960]   it's the same thing with Facebook,
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.400]   you run out of population.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.520]   - And you know who doesn't think it's a big deal?
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:59.640]   - Apple stock buyers, because the price is up 11%
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.600]   over the last six months,
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.120]   even though the last two quarters have been down.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.200]   - They're anticipating higher than expected iPhone sales,
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.600]   I think iPhone 7 has proven hotter
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.280]   than a lot of people thought it would be.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.000]   Well, that, and so that's another thing we'll be looking at
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.800]   iPhone sales numbers for Q4.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.280]   That's the big quarter, right?
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.880]   This is the one that we're all very interested in.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.040]   - Yeah, well, I mean, it went on sale in September,
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.280]   so I think it'll be trailing end.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.600]   - Oh, okay.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.720]   - Of the last quarter.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.600]   And also, Apple said very clearly
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.000]   that they were supply constrained, not demand constrained,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.320]   and that's also gonna reduce.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   - So you got July, August and September
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:39.480]   in this quarterly result, and it was only September,
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.160]   are you right, it's only a few weeks of sales
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.320]   constrained by supply.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.760]   How's that supply now, by the way?
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.360]   You can go into an Apple store and get any phone, can't you?
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   - You can't get any phone, it depends on what color
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.240]   you want still and what area you're in.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.880]   But I went, I added a line, 'cause I got the pixel phone
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.120]   the other day, and I wanted to have both of them in service,
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.480]   especially when I'm traveling for an event.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.600]   I went to add a line, and I was waiting in line,
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.760]   and the three people in front of me were buying iPhones,
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.960]   and the person behind me asked what color iPhones
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.840]   they had available, and that was all the people
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.360]   in the store at the time.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.920]   So, I mean, they were servicing them,
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.200]   they were giving them iPhones, they were setting up,
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.800]   so they clearly had them available,
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.840]   and they clearly had the customers in there who wanted them.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:18.880]   - I will point out, by the way,
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.720]   that I did get the new Pixel XL,
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.480]   almost exactly the same size as 7 Plus.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:27.920]   Very nice camera, but this, especially the Jet Black
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:32.320]   iPhone 7, is industrial design-wise and hardware design
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.240]   and feel, it's just no contest.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.960]   This thing feels so solid and nice,
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.440]   compared to the Google phone.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.880]   Now, the Google phone has, and the assistant is mind-boggling.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.480]   I mean, it blows everything else out of the water,
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:50.440]   including Siri, but is that enough for me
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.480]   to use the Google phone day-to-day?
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   Especially since IOS has improved a lot of the things
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   I didn't like about it.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   The notifications now got to the point
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.560]   where it's comparable to an Android device.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.400]   - They're too rained to call it.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.680]   - You're still-- - They're not used to the choice.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.680]   - Yeah, you know what, and by the way,
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.880]   especially with Samsung falling by the wayside,
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.480]   it's really gummed down to iPhone or Pixel.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.160]   Andy, are you still an Android daily driver?
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:24.040]   - Yeah, I'll say that I've been impressed enough
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.360]   by the iPhone 7 and by the improvements
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.200]   that IOS has made in the past two or three years
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.680]   that I'm not saying that I'm looking to switch,
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.200]   but I'm saying that I can see a reality next year.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.320]   I bought my Nexus 5X last year very happy with it,
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.240]   so I normally wouldn't be even thinking about buying
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.800]   a new phone for two years anyway,
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.440]   but I will be looking very, very seriously at iPhones
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.920]   next year.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.840]   It's Pixel, I'm gonna be super curious to see
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.400]   what Pixel happens because there was,
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.760]   this isn't an Android podcast,
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:57.600]   but I just didn't end our Android podcast last night
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.040]   in which there's some tear downs and some reporting
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:06.040]   from Mars Technica indicates that Google's original plan
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:11.280]   was to have Huawei make partner and build the phone for them.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.960]   They backed out at the last second
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.560]   because they opposed to lack of branding
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:17.880]   and they had to build the entire thing with HTC
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:21.600]   in nine months time instead of the usual 18 month cycle
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:22.560]   that a phone goes to do.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.920]   So it's not as though this is a cut rate phone by any means,
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.320]   but this is not necessarily what Google would have made.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.640]   - Not the peak of Google's capabilities.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.240]   - Right, this isn't a copy of another HTC phone,
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.640]   but nonetheless, it's essentially HTC,
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.920]   what kind of architecture can you adapt for us
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.480]   to make us our new phone?
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.800]   So it's gonna be a hell of a race next year.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:48.080]   If Google, if this is the Pixel 2 is the first Google phone
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.320]   where, nope, we started from zero, we designed everything,
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.880]   we did not adapt from anything,
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.920]   it will be super, super interesting.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.320]   - That's what I'm waiting for too.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.360]   - I actually am now, it's so close that I carry both.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.680]   (laughing)
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:05.360]   I don't wanna carry two phones, but I carry both.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.200]   I do like the camera and the Pixel,
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.840]   and especially in daylight,
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.480]   I do feel like it's a better, slightly better,
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.160]   very slightly better camera than iPhone 7.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.840]   I miss the two lenses very much,
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.680]   the zoom and the iPhone 7.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.720]   - Yeah, and portrait mode is shipped now.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.320]   - And I'm gonna ask you about that in a second,
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:25.240]   because apparently I have no insight
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.600]   into how portrait mode works.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.000]   I made some things up that make sense to me,
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:29.960]   but apparently I'm wrong.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.840]   So you're going to explain a portrait.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.880]   - I didn't add in here what you said,
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.120]   but you're usually pretty good on these things.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.200]   - Well, I understand how technology works,
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:39.240]   so I made up what I thought was a fairly reasonable assumption
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.240]   based on, by the way, only having just started using it yesterday,
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.600]   'cause that's when 10-1 came out.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.600]   We'll talk about that too.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:49.040]   But first I wanna wrap up on the Q4 earnings,
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.960]   which we're gonna get in half an hour.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.000]   So you have half an hour to guess.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.040]   Recode says Apple is about to tell us
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.000]   if it expects to start growing again.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.840]   They will, of course not show huge growth yet,
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.920]   but this is when they give advisement
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.480]   as to the next few quarters.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.560]   And according to, in a freed writing at recode,
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.840]   she thinks that this will be the quarter that Tim Cook
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.880]   or the CFO, who's the new CFO?
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.720]   - Luca Maestry.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:23.120]   - Luca Maestry will say, yes, we think because
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.400]   of this very, very successful iPhone 7,
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.840]   we're gonna see growth next quarter.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.000]   - Yeah, and it's a holiday quarter,
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.480]   so which is usually a big quarter for them.
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.320]   But again, it depends on, in some quarters,
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.640]   they get, it's weird to phrase like this,
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:36.960]   but in some quarters, they get advantage.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.040]   Like when you have a new product that comes out,
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.360]   when something comes out earlier late,
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.960]   all these things can have massive influence.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.360]   When you have max available, you don't have max available.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.640]   When they come a month into the quarter
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.520]   or they come only a few weeks into the quarter,
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.160]   can make massive differences.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.440]   - And of course, this, which is why like--
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.920]   - This will be the next quarter
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.480]   that the supply constraint lifts a little bit,
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.120]   which should mean really big sales.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.440]   - And it's a whole quarter of sales,
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.160]   but again, like it's why it's better looking at companies
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.280]   like Apple and all tech companies,
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.000]   not on a quarter by quarter basis,
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.320]   or even a year over year basis.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.280]   But we wanna take a longer view on these things,
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.560]   and that's something that Wall Street
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.040]   has very little tolerance for anymore.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.160]   - I am very, I have to say, I'm very surprised.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.920]   I thought there would be a negative reaction
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.720]   to the lack of the headphone jack.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.760]   That is not apparent in any way at all.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.920]   People really don't seem to care
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.600]   or are willing to put up with the dongle.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.160]   I bought enough dongles that they're just on all my headphones.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.040]   So as far as I am concerned, I have adapted headphones.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.160]   The problem that's come up is if you always use a headphone,
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.000]   you have those dongles and you're always prepared.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.080]   If you never use the headphones,
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.200]   you're always using Bluetooth, it just doesn't matter to you.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.320]   But if you almost never use headphones,
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.320]   but then you go on a plane
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.520]   and suddenly wanna plug your headphones in,
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.280]   it never even realized.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.360]   That yet's occasionally used people that get bitten.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.440]   And it happened to Georgia last week where she doesn't get it.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.720]   She got on a plane for the first time
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.840]   in like three months and suddenly realized she had no headphone jack.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.520]   - I'm hopeful that the AirPods will solve this whole thing.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.320]   I'm not, you know, I went out and bought a lot of different
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.520]   Bluetooth headphones, including the pair you recommended, Andy,
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.560]   which I like quite a bit.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.000]   I've got them to fit well.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.040]   I bought, I just as an ex, just as a, you know,
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.040]   I wanted to give it a full-tempt test.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.680]   I bought those expensive, like almost $400 Sennheiser's
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.720]   that most people agree are the best quality Bluetooth headphones.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.040]   By the way, they're not much better than any other.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.200]   And I think Bluetooth is a limiting factor.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.080]   So I'll be very interested to try the AirPods
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.880]   and to see how much I get laughed at for wearing them.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.680]   - Do you ever wear one, do you ever wear just one Renee
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.320]   and use it like a Bluetooth headset?
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.960]   Oh my God, he's wearing it right now.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.800]   - Yeah.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.440]   - All the time he says.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.680]   - Because I most, so I don't listen to a lot of music
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.760]   and that usually surprises people,
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.120]   but I like, I watch a lot of Netflix
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.880]   and I listen to a lot of podcasts and a lot of audiobooks.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.680]   And it gets twice the battery life because each one
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.720]   has five hours of battery life.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.960]   So I get 10 out of the same amount of charge.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.480]   That's terrific for me.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.400]   - I may find myself to.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.880]   - Actually, also this, the same company that made those,
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.200]   the headphones that I've recommended,
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.720]   they announced but will not ship until January
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   a wireless, no inter-cross headphone version of it.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.320]   So just like the AirPods, two separate AirPods
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   that you plug in, it basically sends, of course,
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.680]   deadly signals throughout your head and your brain.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.560]   And it has a recharging case so that it will give you,
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.280]   I think the numbers that were signed
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.800]   were something like six hours on battery
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.120]   and then 30 hours total before you have to recharge.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.640]   - Does the AirPods do that, Renee?
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.240]   Do they talk through your brain?
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.960]   - Well, I mean, there's W1 chips in both
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.960]   and both chips talk, they sync together,
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.480]   but they're independent. - They're independent
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.800]   so they don't have to do that.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.240]   - I also empower, like I don't like talking about you.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.320]   - Now, let me ask you what they want you to say.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.160]   (laughing)
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.480]   You've got Apple has signals going through your brain,
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.880]   you'll believe whatever the hell they want you to believe.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.920]   - Somehow I like Apple stuff more and more
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.280]   as I use these AirPods.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.960]   Does the W, okay, and this the other thing,
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.400]   audio quality, now I understand the hardware
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.560]   in the AirPods is the same as in the wired earbuds.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.240]   So I'm not expecting massively improved signal range,
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.200]   but I do believe Bluetooth because of
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.320]   it could strain bandwidth and so forth.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.240]   Doesn't sound as good as wired.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.720]   And I'm wondering if the W1 will help,
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.680]   or is it just a pairing assistant?
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.200]   - It's both pairing and syncing
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.040]   because you have two independent speakers
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.000]   that need to be at the same time.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.880]   So you don't want latency between the two earbuds
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.480]   and they can function independently as well.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.280]   So you want that sort of flexibility.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.480]   To me, I am the opposite of a Golden Ears.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.800]   I am tone deaf and I don't understand sound well.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.760]   And I have all these people in the accessibility community
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.520]   asking me if there's any latency when using voiceover
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.840]   and I keep trying to test it.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.280]   And I really can't tell.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.840]   I feel horrible about that.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.080]   So I'm using these right now.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.840]   They don't sound as good as the in ear headphones
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.960]   that I usually use, which are ultimate ears.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.280]   And I have plugged in.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.720]   - So they don't sound as good as that.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.400]   Yeah, see that was my experience as well.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.760]   So they sound like earbuds to me.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.000]   Like that Apple standard earbuds.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.280]   - They are the same hardware.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.800]   - They're the same exact speakers and drivers.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.280]   - Yeah, so that's okay.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.120]   That's fine.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:04.960]   I mean, they're not terrible.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.000]   And if it's just spoken word,
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.560]   they're more than adequate for spoken word.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.200]   - Oh, they're fantastic for podcasts or even for music.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.120]   - But when I listen to music
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.920]   and I compare it with my $1,000 high-five man
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.040]   electrostatic headphones, no Bluetooth headphone,
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.800]   even the $400 Sennheiser's sound.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.640]   Anyway.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.720]   - I listen to music on the speaker on my iPhone, Leo.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.560]   So I'm not gonna comment.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.400]   - Right.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.440]   However, I'll point this out.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:34.760]   I wear sometimes, I wear hearing aids.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.240]   I have Starkey Halo hearing aids,
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.520]   which pair with my iPhone.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.640]   And one of the main reasons we were listening
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.840]   to the baseball game at a restaurant the other day.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.440]   One of the main reasons I wear those
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.920]   is because audio from the phone goes into the headphones.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.520]   They're wireless.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.840]   They're not full audio range
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.200]   'cause as with all hearing aids,
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.520]   they're designed for voice, not for music.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.600]   But what we wanted to listen to the ball game,
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.000]   we were at a restaurant and Lisa said,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.800]   well, let me just borrow one of your hearing aids.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.640]   And it worked.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.240]   We were both listening to the game
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.720]   while we were talking to each other.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.640]   So to me, what the AirPods would offer
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.280]   is the same kind of flexibility
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.280]   where I could leave them in
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.080]   and use them for that kind of thing.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.080]   And they'd still be much better than the hearing aids are
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.080]   in terms of audio fidelity.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:22.920]   So I--
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.920]   - And the microphone is great.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.120]   The microphone is so good that people think I'm using my iPhone
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.320]   when I'm using that. - I've heard people say like,
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.280]   oh, you finally got back onto your iPhone.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.360]   - So I could see as Dorky as it looks,
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.840]   and actually doesn't look bad on you, Renee.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.880]   I didn't even notice it until you showed us.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.960]   I probably could see myself wearing that a lot.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.200]   It looks a lot better than like the Jabra
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.880]   with the blinking blue light.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.720]   You look like such a, you know,
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.880]   Michael Douglas from Wall Street character.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.240]   You know, you just look like an ass wearing them.
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.880]   But those don't, those you look like a hippie.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.080]   You look like a cutus of Bork.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.320]   (laughing)
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.120]   And these say, you know, like the usual ear pods
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.040]   never stay in for me.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.520]   And I didn't really realize it,
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.800]   but it's because that cord keeps pulling and pulling.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.040]   And these I've gone walking, I go walking in thunderstorm,
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.280]   well, not rain storms, in wind storms,
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.200]   and they've been fun.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.720]   Once in a while they feel a bit loose.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.240]   So I just, you know, move them a little bit
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.400]   and they're, they've been great.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.240]   - Yeah.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.200]   That's one of the big, two big challenges
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.200]   that you have a lot of people that,
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.720]   like when I wear earbuds, it's,
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.880]   if I'm in the house, I'm listening to music on real speakers,
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.360]   or I've got one pair of really decent headphones
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.680]   that no Bluetooth can ever, ever match.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.160]   But I'm wearing these things outside
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.280]   because I'm going for a walk.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.920]   It's not as though all the cars agree to stop going
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.480]   and all the dogs agree to stop barking.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.440]   It's like there's gonna be noise all around me anyway.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.920]   So unless I wanna be so isolated with these,
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.960]   like ear plug, headphones that I can't hear anything
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.640]   and I'll get killed by traffic,
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.400]   I'm not looking for the best fidelity.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.280]   I'm looking for a Budu Khan sort of experience.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.080]   I'm just looking for good enough
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.840]   that it's not just the quality is not distracting me
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.640]   because it's so weak and so bad.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.160]   And for that reason, it's the,
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.440]   these $12 cheap headphones that people buy
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.160]   and they're corded, they're perfectly fine.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.240]   The ones that come in the box,
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.520]   they're perfectly fine for a lot of people.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:11.520]   And as we said when we were discussing this months ago,
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.960]   I don't think that it's gonna be a big enough issue
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.400]   that people are not going to buy.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.120]   People who plan to buy an iPhone
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.080]   are not gonna buy the iPhone,
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:22.480]   but it is going to be something where it's like the,
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.800]   like the deletion of the headphone jack,
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.280]   excuse me, deletion of the ethernet port on the MacBook.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.760]   It's not something that makes every single day terrible,
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:35.280]   but oh boy, the time when you wish it had it and it didn't.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.720]   And you, that's when you're like, I'm dead.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.560]   I have, I would have an easy solution to this
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.520]   if this had the thing that I always had,
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.640]   but it does not have it now and now I am sunk.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:48.080]   I, you know, I thought I would really be angry about it.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.760]   And that's, this, just,
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.480]   and maybe it's 'cause I got the jet black
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.720]   'cause the jet black really is something special,
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.480]   but I just, I just hold this in my, I just, I love it.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.160]   My precious.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.640]   My precious.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.400]   By the way, those Starkey Halo headphones are MFI,
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.000]   they're made for iPhone.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.160]   I would love to see somebody maybe Starkey do an app
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.840]   that would basically, as long as I'm willing
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.360]   to wear those AirPods, make the AirPods full range hearing aids.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.360]   I guess, I guess,
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.960]   - Oh yeah. - are using a mic,
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.080]   either the mic on the AirPods or the mic on the iPhone
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.880]   and amplify the room as well as, I don't know.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.000]   I just feels like that could replace my hearing aids
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.080]   and at a much reduced cost.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.400]   I don't even wanna tell you a hearing aids cost.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.720]   That is talk about who, I'm sure they,
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.480]   they cost that much for a reason.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.960]   - Oh, and one I think is people were asking,
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.240]   if you go into the Bluetooth settings,
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.240]   you can change things like it'll automatically switch
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.680]   between microphones, but you could set it to the left or right.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.480]   And you could also change the double tap from Siri
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.880]   to play pause if you want,
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.320]   which costs you all the Siri commands,
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.920]   but I know some people are really fervent
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.600]   about their play pauses.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.160]   - Yeah, no, I'm in that,
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.720]   I'll be interested to see how that works.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.440]   I'm not sure which I'll choose on that.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.320]   I find Siri more annoying than anything else.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.400]   - For basic commands, it's great.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.680]   Like I'll double tap it and say play Mac break weekly
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.880]   and it's just a podcast app and does it.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.680]   - Yeah, I guess you learn what she's good at
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.640]   and you learn what not to ask her anymore.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.160]   - Well, it's also optimized for certain things.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.600]   Like each of the assistants from each of the companies
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.720]   are very different products.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.680]   And you could tell like one's got a Pixar name
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.560]   and one's got like a Star Trek computer name
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.600]   and one's program like to be really good at this thing
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.720]   and one's program to do it.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.120]   That's why testing this stuff is so hard.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.720]   I mean, Apple's obviously not as good
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.240]   at all the data aggregation as Google,
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.080]   but they're also optimizing for a different problem set.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.640]   - I can't wait to get them.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.440]   I wish I could get them before my plane trip on Thursday.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.920]   That would be a nice time.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.880]   Let's take a break, come back with lots more to talk about.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.480]   But first, I'll tell you one thing I am bringing in
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.920]   on the plane with me, my texture.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.320]   Texture is awesome.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.760]   You know, it used to be I'd go to the airport news stand
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.400]   and stack, you know, my stack of magazines for the flight.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.200]   Then of course, things like Kindle came out
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.200]   and now I can read books, but I love texture.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.280]   I get those great magazines and I get them on my iPad
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.600]   or my iPhone or my Android device.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.640]   And man, it is fantastic.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.480]   The best thing of all with texture,
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.080]   I know, should I not tell you this?
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.840]   You can have five different devices per account.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.360]   So Lisa has the texture account,
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.120]   but I also have my magazines and we have separate,
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.220]   even though it's the same account, we have separate favorites.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.240]   I download my magazines.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.480]   I love texture.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.240]   All the best magazines, 200 plus of the top magazines
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.720]   on your phone, and it's just like the actual magazine.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.360]   So for instance, I've been loving the election coverage
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.200]   and the Atlantic magazine, read that religiously.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.280]   Consumer reports is kind of a must have,
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.320]   I've subscribed for 40 years to consumer reports.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.840]   Now I've got it on my tablet.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.160]   I don't need to subscribe.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:54.160]   National Geographic, People magazine, Rolling Stone.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.160]   There's always something to read on texture.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.720]   And it's like Netflix for magazines.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.960]   You're basically, you're, you're, you're,
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.840]   once you subscribe, you get unlimited access to these.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.200]   You get everything in the current issue, page by page.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.680]   You also get back issues.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.560]   You get bonus features you can't get in regular magazines
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.520]   and print like video.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.960]   I look, you know, I would not subscribe to Ad Week.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.800]   It's very expensive.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.400]   And yet of course we do follow the industry very closely.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.960]   And so now I can read it on my texture.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.200]   Billboard, same thing.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.160]   It's part of my texture subscription, Bloomberg,
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.200]   Bonapati, even Boy's Life.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   If I want to see what's going on,
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:40.200]   what are those two characters, the good guy and the bad guy?
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.120]   Nervous and nervous or whatever.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.240]   I can follow them in Boy's Life.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.040]   It's kind of nice.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:49.120]   Canadian cycling, I'm never, ever going to cycle in Canadian.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.760]   But if I did, you, you're a cyclist.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.080]   You probably love this Renee.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:57.560]   Canadian running is something I'm even less likely to do.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.440]   Car and driver.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.640]   Here's one I don't read, but you might CBS soaps in depth.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.920]   If you follow, if your show is the Young and the Restless
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.760]   or the Bold and the Beautiful, man, you're going to love this.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.880]   Here's a poetry, literary and creative writing magazine
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.280]   for teens called Cicada.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.080]   Great cooking magazines.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.440]   Now see, that's another issue.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.960]   I don't want to go buy a cooking magazine
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.480]   or subscribe to Cooking Magazine,
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.160]   but I want to look for recipes.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.480]   And you can do that across a whole bunch of magazines.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.160]   I can't understand why every single person
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:32.080]   in the world does not have a texture subscription.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.240]   I loved well.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.920]   I love to look at modern home design in these beautiful homes.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.720]   And because you're looking on a tablet, by the way,
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.720]   on the iPad, magazines like that and National Geographic
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.760]   and the Photography magazines really are great,
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.080]   much better, I think, on an iPad than a screened print magazine.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.960]   Much, much better.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.360]   So I know I could go on and on, but I won't go right now
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.360]   to texturetexture.com/twit and just try it free.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.120]   But I warn you, it's so addictive
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.680]   that you probably end up subscribing.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.200]   Texture.com/twit.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.800]   Hello, Canada.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.560]   Hello, Canada.
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.480]   I'm going to get that one.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.320]   Hello.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.240]   Chatellino Francais, Leo.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.400]   Chatellino Francais.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.240]   Chatellino Francais, I don't know if that's in there.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.080]   But--
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.080]   Yeah, hello, Francais.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.000]   I bet she'd run through Canada
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   if you're being chased by a moose fella.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:26.840]   Oh, it is. It's in French.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.920]   Now, see, this would be really good
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.240]   for me to touch up my French chatelline.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.080]   (speaking French)
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.080]   (speaking French)
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:52.080]   Excellent.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.720]   (speaking French)
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.560]   When you run in Canada,
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.600]   you get the exchange rate,
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.440]   going to metrics,
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.920]   it's good for your numbers.
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.080]   It would be actually very good for me to get this
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.440]   and practice my French.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.960]   That's cool.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.600]   Anyway, I could go on and on, but I have,
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.240]   but I'll stop now.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.040]   Great service.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.640]   Yeah, it's not a great idea.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:16.480]   Andy has posted an unedited list
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.400]   of 50 plus iPhone 7 plus images,
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.680]   including beautiful panoramas.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.000]   It is a great phone, isn't it?
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.880]   And look, I bet that's with the Zoom, right?
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.720]   Audrey?
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.840]   These are all unedited,
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.200]   so no cropping, no nothing.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.240]   The rule that I held was that,
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.040]   if any time that I needed to get close,
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.600]   I would have to throw away my usual rule book
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.680]   for using these phones,
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.680]   so that if I needed to get closer,
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:50.520]   I would have to zoom instead of necessarily getting closer.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.080]   I really wanted to see what good the Zoom would do.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.800]   And boy, the only time the,
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.360]   I'm doing a separate review of the camera,
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.320]   separate from the hardware review next week,
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.720]   but really the only times that the iPhone 7 camera
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.680]   let me down was when I,
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.440]   it tricked me, when I got into the headset,
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.880]   that, oh, well, I will do things that are deeply,
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.680]   deeply silly to try to do with a phone camera.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.840]   And that in itself was a compliment because I just kept,
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.440]   I quickly thought of it as just another camera.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   It's a good camera.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.280]   It's also getting, it's an exceptionally good camera.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.120]   It was really hard to trick it.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:29.080]   I went to the big city to take a bunch of pictures.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.520]   In my case, it was Paris.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.680]   And I was very happy.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.160]   In fact, I was happier with my iPhone pictures
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.080]   than I was with my Leica Q pictures,
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.560]   which is saying quite a bit.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.000]   Yeah, and while the Pixel, by the way,
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.560]   and I'm sure you'll do some Pixel album as well,
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.480]   is I would say as crisp,
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.040]   as superb and color rendition,
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.560]   sometimes even better, especially in bright light.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.960]   Although that's an excellent image, boy.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.240]   I just the detail there.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.040]   I think the Pixel's auto HDR is pretty remarkable.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:10.720]   It's tight and having that two lenses really is handy.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.880]   And getting the white color gamut that's managed
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.960]   everywhere from capture through device to exchange
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.440]   between devices to me is, again,
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.680]   one of the things I can't go back from.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.960]   Well, you're a designer, so you see that, you know?
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.160]   You are to color as I am to sound.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.160]   Anyway, beautiful images.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.160]   Thank you for sharing those, Andy.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.160]   I really am.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   I'm going to be posting.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.160]   I still have a few more shots to get.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.160]   I still haven't taken my squirrel pictures.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.160]   So that's probably got to happen on Friday.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   But by the time I publish the camera review,
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.160]   I also want to, I'm also the process of editing
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.160]   and enhancing all of those same pictures,
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.160]   because I also want to kind of make the point
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.160]   that there's a difference between what gets shot
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.160]   and what happens after you spend five minutes
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.160]   tweaking something so that looks like
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.160]   exactly how you like it.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.160]   But what impresses me is that almost any camera
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.160]   is going to take a great shot in sunset, beautiful lighting.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.160]   It's when you start to say,
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.160]   well, here's an instance of which I'm not expecting
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.160]   to take a good photo, but I'll be damned.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.160]   I couldn't get, I couldn't climb the White House fence
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.160]   to get closer as I should have,
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160]   but I'll be damned.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.160]   Not only the optical zoom, but the digital zoom
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.160]   was really, really good.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.160]   In this low light, it was really, really good.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.160]   So I will offer you a little bit more.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.160]   I will offer you a few pictures from Bruj in Belgium,
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.160]   also with the iPhone 7.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.160]   This was on an overcast day, but as an example,
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.160]   I couldn't have got that shot with the Pixel
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   because it zoomed using the 56 millimeter lens.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.160]   And so I'm able, and you can kind of get the sense
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.160]   when I zoom back out.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.160]   I just, what a lovely, lovely camera.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.160]   And if you forget your camera,
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.160]   you don't have to feel so bad.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.160]   - Yeah.
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.160]   - By the way, that's the difference in the HDR.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.160]   I'm saving both the normal and the HDR shot.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.160]   It's subtle, but that's one thing I like about it.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:06.160]   The HDR is subtle, but it does make a difference.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   - I think maybe that's the biggest difference
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.160]   is that the iPhone 6S takes great photos.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.160]   A lot of cameras take great photos,
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.160]   but for me, the 7 Plus, it lets me get photos
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.160]   I couldn't get with those other cameras.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.160]   So it's not to take anything away from those cameras,
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:22.160]   from the low light to the 2X optical zoom
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:25.160]   to the portrait mode, it's just shots I can't get on previous iPhones.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.160]   And that makes a big difference to me.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.160]   - Yeah, very nice.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.160]   Very nice.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:35.160]   Specifically, I rushed to get a iPhone 7 before the trip
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.160]   because I, precisely the same reason you took yours to New York.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.160]   I wanted to get those special images.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.160]   And frankly, my vacation images from the ones I probably
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.160]   look at again and again.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.160]   Just really nice.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.160]   - It's great to have that in front of you.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:57.160]   Like a Comic Con, that's my favorite week of photography ever.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.160]   Just taking pictures of cosplayers.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.160]   And it's such a valuable thing to have.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:06.160]   I have the iPhone, whatever iPhone I have is at my hip
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.160]   because they're times where I've got this really nice,
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.160]   like $2,000 or $3,000 with a camera and lighting gear
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.160]   on a belt or something.
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:16.160]   And that's what I take the really great pictures with,
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.160]   but there are times where I see someone coming along
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.160]   and I don't know if my camera, I just walked out of a dark place
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.160]   and I'm in a light place.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.160]   And I know that I can either risk that I can make adjustments
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.160]   on the fly fast enough with a good camera.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.160]   But if I take out the iPhone, I know that I'll get nothing less
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.160]   than a good shot and I might even get a really great shot.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.160]   - Even in low light, this is a picture from a restaurant
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.160]   that was fairly dim and I know I'm making you jealous.
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.160]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.160]   - If you're like, "Homo nibierico."
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.160]   But this is our favorite restaurant in Paris, Joelle,
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.160]   Obisheau and Laitelier.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.160]   And even in low light, this is fairly dark, the detail and the,
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.160]   "Oh man, now I'm getting hungry."
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.160]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.160]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.160]   Look at little hamburgers.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.160]   They're French hamburgers.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.160]   - You don't want to know.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.160]   - You do.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.160]   - You don't want to know how much more of those custom Big Macs.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.160]   (laughs)
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.160]   Let's see, moving, moving right along.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.160]   Thank you for those images.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   90% of Apple chargers made for iPhone chargers on Amazon art.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   They're fake for an Apple.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:26.160]   90%, mostly sold by one company, right?
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.160]   - Yeah, that's such a huge problem on Amazon
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.160]   and it's not just Apple chargers.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   It's like, unless you see something that is sold by Amazon
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:39.160]   and like Amazon is the seller,
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.160]   you can pretty much count on that pair of headphones as a knock-off
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.160]   or that battery as a knock-off.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:49.160]   You absolutely cannot trust an item sold by a third-party seller
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.160]   on Amazon to be the legit thing.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.160]   - Even if it says them and fine, that's what's really frustrating.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.160]   - Well, of course, because again, these factories in China,
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.160]   they make them to be apps.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.160]   They make them too deceive.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.160]   I bought, I used to have, I have like four batteries for my Olympus camera
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.160]   and I kept getting caught, "Oh my God, why is this?"
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.160]   I just charged this, I know I just charged all four of these.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.160]   Why did I only get like 60 pictures from this one?
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.160]   And only when I put all four of them side by side
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.160]   and I saw that with a lettering on one of them was not quite the right one,
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.160]   had the Olympus logo, same molding, same color, same everything.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.160]   And again, that's why if one thing is cheaper than the others,
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.160]   there's a reason why.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.160]   And that's why every time I'm about to buy something on Amazon,
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.160]   I always check unless it's sold by Amazon.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.160]   That's the seller's not really fulfilled by Amazon, right?
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.160]   - Not fulfilled by Amazon.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.160]   - Sold by?
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:39.160]   - Ships from and sold by Amazon because they will get pissed off
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.160]   if they sold you an illegitimate product.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.160]   They're not doing enough to clamp down on these knockoffs though
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160]   through their third-party sellers.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.160]   - Apple has filed a trademark infringement case against a company called MobileStar.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.160]   Amazon said they were the primary supplier of counterfeit products.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.160]   MobileStar not only illegally using its trademark,
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.160]   including the made for iPhone logo,
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:04.160]   but that the fake chargers had not passed safety tests.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.160]   - Yeah, that's the big deal.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.160]   - That's a huge deal.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.160]   - Yeah.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.160]   - Take a look at a teardown between a genuine Apple charger
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.160]   and one of these knockoffs.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.160]   And it seems as though the Apple charger basically has all of the computing power
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.160]   of an Apple IIE in it.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:24.160]   With all of the stuff it's doing to make sure that it's charging everything
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.160]   correctly, it's tapering down the charge correctly.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.160]   It's not generating too much heat.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:33.160]   This is stuff that will burn your apartment or your house down
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.160]   if you're buying a cheap knockoff.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.160]   If you buy an Apple product, it's been tested.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.160]   Again, this is the reason why you're spending extra 50 or 60 bucks
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.160]   for that kind of quality because it's there to make sure
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:48.160]   you don't have to replace every article of clothing and object you've bought
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:51.160]   in the past 20 to 40 to 50 years of your life.
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.160]   - Renee, I know at any moment you're going to get a press release from Apple,
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.160]   so don't hesitate to interrupt if you want to go and file.
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.160]   - 33 minutes.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.160]   - 33 minutes.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.160]   - I have a telegram bought
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.160]   that's the Apple PR bought.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.160]   And whenever Apple issues a press release,
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.160]   I get a notification from Telegram, so I'll keep an eye on that as well.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.160]   This is in the lawsuit.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:15.160]   This is Apple filing over the last nine months.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.160]   Apple is part of its ongoing brand protection efforts
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.160]   has purchased well over 100 iPhone devices,
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   Apple power products and lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.160]   and delivered through Amazon's fulfillment by Amazon program
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:35.160]   almost 90% of those products were counterfeit,
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.160]   90 out of 100.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.160]   So that really as a consumer, so what are you saying?
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:44.160]   So I used to say, well look for the MFI logo,
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:47.160]   but if that's being counterfeited and it's easy to do on a page,
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:53.160]   what you're saying Andy is make sure it says not only fulfilled by Amazon
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.160]   but sold by Amazon.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.160]   - Right, ships from and sold by Amazon.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160]   - Okay.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.160]   - 'Cause they're very careful with their sources.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.160]   - I think either way you can send it back for a refund.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.160]   I'm not sure if I have to double check,
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.160]   but they have very good return policy.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.160]   Certainly if it ships from and sold by Amazon, no questions asked.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:14.160]   And it back, you don't even have to particularly have to have a reason.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:17.160]   And they'll pretty much take care of you.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.160]   But yeah, they'd be super, super careful.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:24.160]   I got burned a couple of times and it's just very, very good to know.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.160]   - Apple is going to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.160]   They're gonna have some of that how many bad it go.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160]   - Really?
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.160]   That's sufficient reason.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.160]   - That's the only reason to go.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.160]   - That's it.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.160]   - Yeah.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.160]   - Just go have some ham.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   - Yeah.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.160]   - That's, everyone listening.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160]   - That's no joke.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   - No, it's not a joke.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.160]   - And it's not like, it's the Kobe people you go.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.160]   - It's not like you go to like Philadelphia,
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160]   oh, there are places that serve cheesesteaks.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.160]   It's like, no, no, no.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.160]   If everywhere you go, there is a place that has a huge pack of parmaham
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.160]   that will slice you off.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.160]   There was a shopping mall near my hotel and it's went somewhere
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.160]   just gonna need like some tape or something.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:04.160]   And every, every, every, every orange, orange,
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.160]   Julius was a ham shop and every cinnabon was a ham shop.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.160]   And it's like, and even when you buy like a lace potato chips,
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.160]   like a little bag of lace potato chips, it's not, it's not,
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:16.160]   it's not, it's hemon flavor.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.160]   It's like a, and a specific kind of ham flavor.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:21.160]   And it's, it's, it's not, and you think that it would taste just like
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.160]   every other like bacon flavor, no, it's the best ham flavored flavor
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.160]   and the most ham flavored, glazed potato chip you've ever had.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.160]   Now, if anybody wants to give me a birthday gift,
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.160]   this is only $800.
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.160]   This is the entire ham, the leg with the bone in it,
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.160]   but you can't stop there.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.160]   You also have to buy me the very special hardwood ham holder
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:49.160]   that allows you to hold that leg and then slice it.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.160]   So I'm just saying you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't,
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.160]   you don't, part of the part of the reason why you put $900 into a leg of ham
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:01.160]   is to show it off and sort of flaunt to the neighbors.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:05.160]   I will, if, if I received this for my birthday,
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.160]   put it right here on the table and offer anybody who comes in a nice,
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:14.160]   thin slice of Iberico hamon.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.160]   So why is that?
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.160]   Sorry, we really got sidetracked on that one.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.160]   Now, at least nothing next year that is as impressive in the world of phones
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.160]   as that ham is in the world of ham.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.160]   And doing all the vegetarians watching that.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.160]   It's a memorable, it's a very good ham.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.160]   So why is Apple going to Mobile World Congress?
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.160]   Now this is the place where currently, I mean,
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.160]   that's where you announce phones.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.160]   Obviously they're not going to announce a new phone this spring.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.160]   What's the theory here?
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.160]   Why are they going?
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.160]   Do we know?
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.160]   I actually hadn't seen the story until it was on the show today.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.160]   They have a, well.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.160]   They know what a CES.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.160]   It depends who goes.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.160]   This is going to be a booth.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.160]   I mean, they don't do a booth at CES anymore.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:27:00.160]   So in a hall 8.1, they're going to have the app planet stand.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.160]   I remember they're doing a TV show, The Planet of the Apps.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.160]   Do they have a program called App Planet right now?
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.160]   That's the one that they've hired Will I Am?
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.160]   That's Planet of the Apps, right?
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.160]   What's App Planet?
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.160]   Yeah, I'll tell you the last thing you never know.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.160]   I think the listing is probably the same thing.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.160]   It's the same thing.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.160]   So what this might be is promoting the TV show.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.160]   I don't know.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.160]   We don't know.
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.160]   Is it Mobile World?
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.160]   It's got me.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.160]   No.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:39.160]   So they'll be in hall 8.1 as well as two spaces in the upper level in the Fira Graa Via Converrana Center.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.160]   Also, it's, it's, Mobile World Congress is enormous.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.160]   Right.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:50.160]   It's not the, it's not the same as like a small show, any show that's, that's happening in
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.400]   the United States, it's like Apple would by definition dominate and would anything they
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:57.680]   do would disrupt the era of every other thing.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:02.480]   That's actually a show where they can kind of almost be invisible and still have a rather
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.480]   large presence.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:04.480]   So who knows?
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.160]   I can't even guess.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:14.880]   So the numbers are in and according to IBM's vice president of IT Fletcher Previn who
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:22.440]   by the way served as an intern at the late show with David Letterman and Conan O'Brien.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.880]   So he knows how to do a presentation.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.920]   According to Yahoo Finance, he could be one of the funniest IBM vice presidents, the company
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:30.920]   employees.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:33.400]   It's just very low bar.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.480]   Max are three times cheaper to own than Windows PCs.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:41.560]   Remember IBM went all in on Macintosh offering Macintosh encouraging people to use Macintosh
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:47.000]   instead of Windows 10 PCs.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.440]   And he's the guy who did it.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:54.960]   He's the guy responsible for turning basically turning IBM, which it's no, you know, I mean,
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.160]   it invented the PC into a Mac house.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:06.680]   And he said, Max were less expensive to support than Windows at only 5% of IBM's Mac employees
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:10.520]   needed help desk support 40% of PC.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.480]   I shouldn't laugh.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.720]   40% of PC users needed needed support.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:20.920]   At that time, 30,000 IBM employees are using Max today.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:27.800]   It's 90,000 and IBM ultimately plans to distribute 150 to 200,000, 150,000 to 200,000
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:32.400]   Macs to workers, which will make half of their employees Mac users.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.400]   That is real.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.880]   I think that's a huge enterprise victory.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.880]   And what does it apply to Apple?
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:37.880]   Maybe.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.680]   I don't know either, but we did a bunch of research and saw that the resale value for
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.520]   Max is typically way higher than a lot of their counterparts.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.960]   So for companies that, you know, either they can pass them down and get much longer lifespan
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.680]   out of them or for small businesses that actually do want to resale and they would
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:54.160]   coop a lot more of the value of those max than they would have comparable hardware.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:58.520]   So it's got benefits both in terms of lower support costs and retaining higher value.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:05.080]   He acknowledges the max cost more out of the, you know, at the onset, 117 to 454 more dollars
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.960]   than a similarly configured Windows PC.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.000]   But here's the ammunition you need.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.360]   If you want to convince your boss over four years, IBM saves 273 to 543 dollars per Mac.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.160]   So they save more than they cost.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.800]   And of course, their support costs are lower.
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:28.960]   It ends up being, according to Previn, 57.3 million dollars more expensive per 100,000
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:29.960]   Windows machines.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.880]   That's three times the cost.
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:33.800]   And he says, this is a conservative number.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:39.560]   And it's the best pricing we've ever got from Microsoft and employees are happier.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.080]   91% satisfaction rate.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:50.240]   And that's one of the reasons that IBM is standardizing on Mac and Tasha's.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:54.240]   He does say he has some trouble getting the people who are using blackberries to give
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.240]   up their blackberries.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:59.720]   They got you on BBM.
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:04.120]   They are 65% iOS, 33% Android.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.960]   So that means 2% blackberry.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:13.800]   Very interesting and useful ammunition for any IT person who wants to convince the boss
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:16.880]   that maybe we should consider Macintosh computers.
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:19.280]   And that happened to me back when I still worked in enterprise.
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:22.640]   I was getting a brand new Dell top of the line because I was a designer every year and
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.000]   it came with onsite service.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.560]   And we just think we kept needing the onsite service.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:30.840]   We would go down and wait a couple of days and they'd come in and they'd do it.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.640]   And then the latest one shipped one year was when Vista first came out and it shipped without
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.360]   supporting its own graphics cards, which is wooden boot.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:41.360]   And we were waiting and the IT guy said, why don't you just buy a Mac?
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.720]   So they requisitioned me a Mac.
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.200]   I got a 17-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.200]   The rest is history.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.200]   You did after that.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.120]   And that computer, I used that for two years.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.120]   They used to get me a new computer every year.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.280]   I used it for two or three years.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.040]   And then it got passed down.
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.960]   And I think we got six years out of that machine, which was much more than we got out
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:55.960]   of any of the other ones.
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:58.680]   Well, you had to because Apple never made new ones.
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:04.840]   I've got four years out of this laptop because maybe, maybe, sorry, I shouldn't say anything,
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.400]   but maybe you'll be replaced Thursday.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.800]   Happy birthday to the iPod.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:12.040]   It's 15th birthday was Saturday.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.040]   Oh, 2001.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:20.480]   It's nice to have these anniversaries to remind us that the product has not totally been canceled
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:21.480]   yet.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.760]   Well, it had a good run.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.320]   15 years is a long time.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   Yep.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:33.720]   You know, I now have more storage in my watch than I had in my original iPod.
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:38.200]   But anyway, that's nice.
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.200]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.440]   I've seen Fidel never have to work a day again in their lives.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.440]   That's true.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:46.600]   What is the designer here?
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.280]   Here's one that and Renee, maybe you can set me straight.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.800]   I was a little perturb.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:58.280]   First of all, we read stories that the memory, the storage on the 32-gig iPhone 7s is slower
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:32:59.800]   than the others.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:03.120]   I don't know why that would be.
[01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.520]   Most people say, well, can you notice?
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.080]   No, it's like most.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.040]   So this stuff is all incredibly complicated.
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:11.480]   So I want to say in advance that if people don't understand this, that's fine.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.480]   They're not supposed to.
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.280]   It's an implementation detail.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.840]   And there's a lot of things going on in terms of like there's different kinds of flash memory
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:21.640]   that are mixed in there that have different characteristics when it comes to reliability.
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:26.080]   Like there's twin level and multi level that can contain higher density data, but you know,
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:30.400]   they lose they lose efficiency faster because you're burning through more cell membranes.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:34.880]   You have an advantage when you step up in terms of capacity, it adds more controllers
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:35.880]   to the mix.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.120]   So you get higher parallelism.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.680]   And that means the chips themselves are the same speed, but you're using more at once.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.560]   You can move greater amounts of data.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.600]   It's like having three cars instead of one car.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:47.720]   Each car is the same speed, but you're moving three cars at once.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:50.760]   So depending if you're only moving a few people, doesn't make a difference.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.160]   Moving a lot of people, it does.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.960]   Also the testing apps for these are usually, I don't mean this to be mean to the testing
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.280]   companies, but they're testing for specific things.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.720]   And we used this last year when there was that controversy over the chips.
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.040]   If you have one sprinter that's fast off the gate and one that's great on the end stretch
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.640]   and you're measuring at different points in time, you'll get widely.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.640]   Different results.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:14.880]   So if you're throwing a test load at one of these and you're exceeding the cash on the
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:18.920]   smaller one because the caches are proportional, but not on the bigger one, you're going to
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:24.760]   get very different results even when the real world loads are not different in practice.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.800]   And there's like five or six of these things that are incredibly dependent on the on what's
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.080]   happening at the moment.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:34.120]   And when Apple builds these things and they're just, they're not useful for doing like a video
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:38.840]   on showing relative speeds because you're not going to get the performance in real life.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:43.200]   The thing that counts in this is that Apple bases their internal criteria off the 32 gigabyte,
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.480]   whatever is the lowest model is what they base the criteria on.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:51.280]   So in normal life, you won't notice any difference in certain tasks you will benefit from the
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.980]   parallelism of the higher capacity ones just because they're throwing more chips at the
[01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:56.980]   problem.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:59.080]   The same way like you'd throw more, more cores at the problem.
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:00.080]   All right.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.080]   But there's no slower.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.120]   There's some phones that are faster under certain conditions, but there's no slower
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.120]   phones.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.160]   It sounds like a dumb difference.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.800]   It's a difference people care about.
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.440]   This one you're going to have to explain though.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.360]   This I don't know if this is as easily explained away.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.760]   If you if in the United States, there are two models of iPhone seven.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.440]   There's a CDMA model and a GSM model.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:25.760]   Now I'm not sure I'd go as far as the T&W went and say Apple made two versions of the
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:28.760]   iPhone seven and one of them socks.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:32.640]   But there's a distinct difference between the CDMA and the GSM models.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:38.440]   The CDMA models use a modem from Qualcomm that does both GSM and CDMA.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.200]   The others use an Intel modem, which is apparently slower.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.880]   So you can tell it's very simple.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.360]   If you bought your phone from Verizon Sprint or you bought it at SimUnlocked, you have the
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.320]   good one, the Qualcomm modem.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:56.840]   But if you bought it from AT&T or as I did from T mobile, you'll have the T mobile, I
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.640]   mean, the Intel model.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:07.800]   You can also tell if you look on the back, the Qualcomm modems are a 17 series phones.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:11.080]   The Intel modems are a 17 series phones.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.920]   The Qualcomm modems, the good ones are a 16.
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:19.040]   I have an a 17 series and it does make a difference in terms when you get in terms of speed,
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:25.320]   but more importantly when you get weak signals, the Intel modem doesn't perform as well.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:28.840]   Now, this is the kind of thing you're probably not going to notice because you don't have
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:32.320]   two phones with you at all times.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.760]   But it does seem like a significant difference.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.760]   Yes.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:36.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.000]   So I mean, I haven't had as much what I did with the when I was busy with all the SSD
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000]   stuff.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.880]   I talked to a lot of experts and got a lot of opinions and a lot of information and then
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.120]   tried to figure out what was going on.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.080]   And I haven't had that opportunity with it.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.800]   I've only started looking into it.
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:52.280]   I would not be surprised that there was a difference because Qualcomm has been making
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.840]   since Apple switched from Infineon.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:54.840]   This is a new chip.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:59.560]   This is brand new and Intel is brand new to being in the iPhone.
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.680]   And if they're not getting the performance that Qualcomm is, I would not be surprised.
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:05.560]   Does it get soft or is it a hardware issue?
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:06.560]   I think it's both.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.640]   So the problem with Qualcomm is that they own CDMA.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:14.840]   If you want to have CDMA in your device, you are paying and I've heard rumors that it's
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:19.160]   exorbitant retail, like full retail value, not even wholesale share, but retail share
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.320]   off the profits.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.440]   And that's only because Verizon and Sprint in the US are stuck on them.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:27.520]   It's a tax the entire world paid for two or three generations because of Sprint and Verizon
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:28.520]   in the US.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:31.240]   So the world wants to get off this technology.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.720]   And Apple doesn't want to have to carry that.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.120]   They don't want to have to pay Qualcomm a huge percentage of profits for every phone
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.960]   sold around the on the on lock phone because they want the unlock phone to work on CDMA
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.960]   networks.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.880]   They do use the Qualcomm radio.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:43.880]   Absolutely.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.160]   So I get the problem.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.040]   So I think this absolutely could be a problem.
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:49.800]   I want to get more information before I say definitely.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.920]   But the quality of cell reception is so dependent on so many circumstances.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.920]   If you're standing three feet to the left or right, if what the weather is, how many
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.680]   people are on the tower in your area, that you would have to have two phones in perfect
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.520]   condition to notice the difference.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:07.640]   And whether it makes a real difference to you or not, again, I can't say because I haven't
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.120]   looked at it enough yet, but I would be surprised if a normal person in normal working conditions
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.920]   noticed a huge disparity.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:19.760]   I think you'd notice more going inside a building or that's, you know, it would show up in
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.560]   the edge cases and it would only show up if two people with two phones standing next
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:30.480]   to one another in a kind of one of these like cliff situations where you're right on the
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:35.720]   edge of getting a signal, which by the way is here in the studio.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.280]   If you had the CDMA phone, you might be better off.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.080]   It's hard to do that though because you might be on different networks.
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.400]   You more likely be on different networks, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:49.720]   Verizon phones had a lot of trouble with the iPhone 7 and they got fixed with iOS 10.0
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:53.760]   point zero three, I think, you know, so you're not immune to anything depending on what chips
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:56.520]   that you have.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.720]   The recommendation then to get the for either the unlocked phone or the Verizon phone?
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.560]   I would get if there's any chance that you were going to travel with your phone, I would
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:08.080]   just default to getting that one anyway, especially if you're going world because a
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.600]   world phone, if you do any sort of traveling is always a benefit to you.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:15.520]   If you know absolutely you're going to be on AT&T mobile in the US, then you probably won't
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.720]   notice a huge difference.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:21.240]   Well, one nice thing about T-Mobile, one of the things that makes this workable for me
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:25.520]   because we get no signal from T-Mobile inside our building, but T-Mobile Wi-Fi calling works
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:26.520]   great.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.320]   By the way, it's not on by default, which surprised me.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:32.120]   So I had to turn it on in the settings in the iPhone and there are a couple of places
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.120]   you have to turn it on.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.080]   Once you turn it on though, you wouldn't know I don't get a signal.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.320]   I get a great signal.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.800]   John, you're using a Verizon phone with a T-Mobile SIM because Verizon doesn't lock their SIM
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:43.800]   shots.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:44.800]   Is that working fine?
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:49.240]   So this is the one I bought before I left.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:53.280]   And I had to activate it using the AT&T SIM card.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.520]   But once I had activated it, I took out the SIM card, put a T-Mobile SIM in and it worked
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:02.360]   just fine all over the world and John's still using it here and it works fine.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:07.240]   So it would be okay, I think, to get the Verizon phone and use whatever carrier you wanted.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.080]   My review phone is Verizon or I stuck a Roger SIM in it, I think, a day later or two days
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.080]   later.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.080]   Exactly.
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.400]   Good to know and don't feel bad.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:22.880]   And by the way, kudos to cellular insights.com because cellular insights.com actually had the
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:29.600]   machine that tests this, which is a non-trivial thing and why you're not going to see this
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.440]   story in every magazine.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.760]   But they were able to do it.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:37.120]   And just one more little piece.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.840]   If you wanted the phone that has the best wireless signal, get yourself a Galaxy S7 because
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.520]   it beats them all.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.520]   It's better.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.560]   The Galaxy X7 Edge is better than the iPhone 7.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.840]   Well, the entire body is radio transparent.
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:49.840]   Yeah, it's glass.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:54.600]   It'd be surprising if it didn't fit in the LG, then the Nexus.
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.560]   What they didn't test was the newest Google phone they haven't tested that yet.
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.320]   So we'll have to wait and see on that one.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.080]   It's got a huge radio transparent window on top two, is that expect?
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.080]   Right.
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.080]   I hope that it does.
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.080]   It has that big glass panel on it back, right?
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:12.600]   It's ugly, but it's functional.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:18.280]   Something else that we want to say here, 15th and an iPod.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.640]   Sonos speakers now available on Apple Online Store.
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:23.600]   And of course, that's exciting because soon you'll be able to use your Sonos speakers
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.600]   with your Amazon Echo.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.240]   Someone made earrings to catch the AirPods when they fall out.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.240]   [laughter]
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.240]   AirPod hammocks.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:37.000]   What do I have to see a picture of this?
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000]   Do they have a picture?
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000]   Oh, let's see.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000]   Here it is.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000]   It is.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.360]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.880]   I'm not wearing those.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.600]   That would be silly.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.480]   It's like a little garbage can hanging off your ear to catch the AirPod when it falls
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.480]   off.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:54.480]   I guess it has to play that.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.560]   Okay, but what if it were a neutral color that would go with more of your cups?
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:01.040]   I'm just one of the new primitives.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.960]   AquaMarine is a very, very tough color to add.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:10.120]   Just stay away from Steph and Curry because he'll just...
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:15.520]   Most expensive in-app purchase ever.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.840]   Apple Pay was used to buy a $1 million Aston Martin.
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:25.320]   The DB5 James Bond's car, 1964.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:28.640]   Was it Mark Newsome who bought it?
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:32.720]   They used their fingerprint to authorize the purchase.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.040]   That is right out of James Bond, right there out of a movie, you know?
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:37.320]   All right, Mr. Bond.
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.200]   You must authenticate the transfer of $15 billion.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:43.200]   British Animal...
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:44.200]   You expect me to talk?
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.200]   No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to press.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.040]   Impress to fingerprint.
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:55.120]   British Animal of the election house, Coise of Kensington sold it for £825,000.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.920]   Please sir, would you put your finger here?
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:58.920]   Wow.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:00.920]   Oh, do pay attention, James.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.760]   This is for your benefit.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.760]   Thank you, Q.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:09.800]   Now that when you long press on the button, you simply get a list of your contacts.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:14.280]   However, when you 3D touch you prime the bomb, leave it behind.
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:15.280]   This is Scenic.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.880]   Oops, sorry, I didn't mean the autoplay.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:18.680]   Thank you, Scenic, once again, for annoying me.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.720]   We've put many of these same prototypes in Samsung Galaxy as smartphones.
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.920]   And now from the Neiman Marcus catalog, you know, every year in the back of the catalog,
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:34.640]   they have something you can't afford but really want a rose gold personal plane to go with
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:36.720]   your rose gold phone.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:40.560]   Renee Richie and your rose gold iPad, Renee Richie and your rose gold MacBook.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.760]   No, now it's jet black.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:42.760]   It's too late.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.800]   If only they had it last year, I would have totally have gotten it.
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:45.800]   But now I need a jet.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:47.600]   It's only a million and a half.
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.480]   It's, you know, you're going to want to keep that plane in a jet.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.680]   Is that that glossy cut?
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:54.120]   That glossy finish is going to get scratched.
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.440]   It's a carbon composite.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:58.600]   Oh, that's the S.R. 71 was Matt, right?
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.600]   That's right.
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.600]   The stealth.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.600]   All right.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:08.400]   Yeah, you should get a stealth bomber to match your new phone.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:15.760]   I like piano black and I have to say I'm going like Renee Richie commando on this.
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:18.120]   You inspire me, Renee.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:24.720]   And while I am careful with it, you know, I have not had any as far as I can tell, micro.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:29.040]   Josh Windish comes over because he's he's also got it and he's got his like sheath in
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:33.920]   the, you know, phone condom because he's really terrified of micro abrasions.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.400]   I've got the, but I own them like the Millennium Falcon.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:38.200]   It's like who wants a pristine mint Millennium Falcon?
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.440]   You want it, you want it gone through a few asteroid fields.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.800]   I'm careful not to put it down on a scratch surfaces, but I don't, I think it's and and
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.320]   man, it feels so good.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.200]   Did I mention that if I mentioned that?
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:53.200]   Right.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.200]   This is a good opportunity to ask you a question.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:00.960]   At this point, are you Instagramming photos of your Apple devices on top of like concrete
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:05.680]   services just to troll the people who get a gassed every time they post a picture like
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:06.680]   that?
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:07.680]   Oh, I should do this.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:08.680]   They're so I totally approve.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.680]   I should do that.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:11.160]   So I did do one where I made it.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:13.960]   People were so, they're so upset by and the thing is that if you put it straight up or
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.960]   down, there's no, there is not scratching anything.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.760]   It's just when he's straight up and down on the surface.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.160]   So I don't really worry about it.
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:22.400]   But people got so upset that I took a photo a couple of weeks ago where I actually had
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.600]   it floating above the concrete as in an attempt to make them feel a little better.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:29.520]   I do have to admit it's the worst fingerprint magnet ever.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.320]   I mean, yes, it never ever, you know, you have to get a rag and some cleaner to just
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.520]   before you show it off.
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:37.280]   It's got, you know, it's greasy.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:39.320]   But then it lights up the room, Leo.
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.760]   Oh, I love it.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:41.960]   Oh, I love it.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:42.960]   Will they make?
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:45.800]   I'll be watching Thursday a piano.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:46.800]   What do they call it?
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:47.800]   Jetblack.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:48.800]   MacBook.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.800]   A jet black.
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:50.800]   I love it.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.480]   I love a matte black.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.960]   Well, they've got the machines now.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.480]   I've got the space gray.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:01.240]   So yeah, I don't want no more space gray, no more rose gold for me.
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:03.960]   I'm all about the jet black.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:07.120]   Black is back, baby.
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.640]   Then I would be I would be in line to buy a jet black MacBook.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.560]   I really would.
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:14.880]   All right.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:18.400]   We're going to take a break and then your picks get ready, folks.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:24.520]   But first a word from our sponsor, a fine Canadian company that I love.
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:30.000]   Fresh books, fresh books save my bacon back when I was a freelancer and I had to do invoices
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.280]   and I never did invoices.
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.200]   And then you know what I learned when you don't build people, they don't pay you.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:39.040]   And that was a problem after a few months.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.760]   That's when Amber MacArthur told me about fresh books.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.240]   He said, there's this new Toronto company.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.720]   They they make invoicing easy.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:49.680]   Fresh books in the intervening 12 years has gotten better and better.
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:53.520]   They've just released their all new version.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.680]   Fresh books, cloud accounting software, redesign from the ground up, custom built for freelancers
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.400]   and small business owners.
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.600]   And it's so much more than invoicing.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.360]   Your dashboard tells you exactly where you stand.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.320]   You know, we have an accounting firm.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.120]   We have in in-house bookkeepers.
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:13.080]   I have a CFO.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.480]   So I can, you know, they show me balance sheets.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:16.480]   I look at it.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.480]   I don't know what it means.
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:22.440]   But there, but if you are on your own, you don't have a balance sheet, this will do it
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.440]   for you.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:26.400]   It'll tell you exactly where you stand, what you've got, what you're build, what's out
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.080]   that you haven't been paid.
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.560]   You can cut and it's just so sweet.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:35.360]   Outstanding balances, spending track your spending.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.400]   Do you know what your total profit is so far this year?
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:38.400]   I bet you don't.
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:42.640]   I bet you won't know till tax time with fresh books you will.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:47.640]   And then reports that you need for your accountant for tax time, like your sales tax
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.680]   summary, your profit and loss statement.
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:53.160]   And of course, it all centered around invoicing.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:57.920]   Beautiful, professional invoices you can create in less than 30 seconds with your logo, color
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:02.040]   scheme of your choice, any image that reflects your brand.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:05.000]   You can chat with your client regarding invoice once they receive it.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.520]   And if they say that I didn't get it, you can tell whether they did or not.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:14.040]   You'll see not only which invoices have been sent, but which have been viewed and which
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:18.440]   have been paid as well as overdue and outstanding invoice totals.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.240]   You got to see the new fresh books.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.240]   It is spectacular.
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:27.560]   Time tracking, of course, the fresh books app does all the things you need on the go.

[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:35.640]   I know you didn't get in business to become a bookkeeper unless your business is bookkeeping.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.440]   You got in business to do the thing you love.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.720]   And yet you still got to do the books.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.040]   Fresh books does it.
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:43.520]   So it's, it's like automated.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.840]   It's so awesome.

[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:12.680]   I was blown away.
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:14.000]   Fresh books.com/macbreak.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:23.280]   We thank you so much for helping us, helping me for years and making Mac break weekly possible.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:24.280]   Andy and not code.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:25.640]   Do you have a pick this week?
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.240]   A combination pick and tip.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.240]   Now I have a pick.
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:30.240]   It's a tip.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:31.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:35.120]   Well, no, there's something you can spend money on.
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.520]   It's I'm not letting you go off the book.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:44.360]   So these are the, a lot of people have the same problems with like earbuds that I have.
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:48.280]   It comes, they come with like a selection of like inserts.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:50.040]   You can pick the one that fits the best.
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:52.400]   I have a little bag of all of those, right?
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.400]   Right.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.120]   But they're like kind of impossible.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:00.240]   You have to pick the one that kind of feels not the worst, the least, so to speak.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.440]   And one of the problems is that like they're like, here's the typical kind where they're
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:09.840]   just kind of so squishy where even if they're the right size for your ear, unfortunately
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:12.800]   they're not going to really conf, they're not going to have a really tight seal.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:14.800]   Like I didn't really like this.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:20.960]   I didn't really like the sound on these earbuds until I really went through all the eight
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.320]   different sets that they came with and found the one that was the best.
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.480]   But finally I got a little, I finally I was getting based.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:30.480]   I finally was getting highs and lows, but they weren't terribly comfortable because
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:31.880]   of that super tight seal.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:34.440]   So here's the tip that was just brilliant.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.880]   I just found this tip last week.
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:42.320]   There's this miracle, miracle compound called Subaru, S-U-G-R-U.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:48.240]   And what it is, is this rubber that cures, doesn't cure until it's exposed to air.
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:53.720]   So it comes in these little like soy sauce packets, like a vacuum sealed.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:58.600]   And then when you tear it open, it's this malleable clay like material that you can mold and you
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:00.600]   can sculpt, you can stick to things.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:06.160]   And you have like at least 20 minutes to 15 minutes to work with it until it starts to
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:07.160]   harden up.
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.880]   But when it hardens, it turns into hard rubber.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.200]   So here's the tip.
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:15.680]   What you do is now you notice that here are my new and improved earbuds.
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:16.680]   And I have those.
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:17.680]   I like them.
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:18.680]   But they're not super comfortable.
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:19.680]   Yep.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:20.680]   Yep.
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:25.480]   And you notice that they're not perfectly round because what you do is you take one of these,
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:29.440]   you take one of these like earbuds, you turn it inside out.
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.440]   I can't do it.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:31.440]   I can't demonstrate the old one.
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:35.640]   What you do is you turn it inside out, you put it on the headphones.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:41.360]   And then you take just a little little like line of Subaru, roll it around there, roll
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:45.200]   it back on top of it, and then jam it into your ear.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:52.040]   So what happens is that if the rubber will deform, hold it in the shape of your ear canal.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:56.320]   And so you get something close to a beautiful custom fit.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.720]   There are some tips.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:59.720]   And that's exactly how easy it is.
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:03.800]   Because again, look how soft it is because you've just taken out of the package.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:05.240]   Subaru has like a million uses.
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:09.080]   It's like if you have this around the house, you will find it'll be a solution to emergency
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:10.520]   and it'll be the perfect solution.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.800]   But just you stick it in there.
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:16.500]   You leave them in for about a half an hour or so until like it starts to really, really
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:17.500]   firm up.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:20.880]   They fully cure in 24 hours, but then they will hold that shape.
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:23.760]   They will be a completely tight seal.
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:30.480]   And that's the difference between having beautiful full music and comfortable stuff that you
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:32.040]   can wear all night long.
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:33.200]   I've heard of people doing this.
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:37.320]   I thought they put the Subaru into their ear.
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:39.320]   Yeah, which is pretty bad.
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.320]   Don't do that.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.320]   You don't want to do that.
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:46.160]   Actually, if you're listening to this and you don't look for the link in the show notes,
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.280]   you just Google for it, you might see, "Hey, all I had to do was jam a whole tuba so you
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:52.280]   would not do that."
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:58.320]   And then jam, you're not supposed to have prolonged skin contact with the Subaru.
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:03.120]   But the thing is, you have to put even a little bit less than you might think you have to
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:04.120]   do.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:07.800]   But once you roll it back over, the Subaru is completely contained within the earbud.
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:08.800]   That's a good way to do that.
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:09.800]   It's your tearskin.
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.800]   But we want the silicone on your skin.
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:13.760]   You don't want the Subaru on your skin.
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:14.760]   Exactly.
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:18.640]   This is a special kind of rubber that will not irritate your skin.
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:20.520]   But like I said, it's perfect.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:21.520]   It's night and day.
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:25.040]   I wish I had had this tip a couple of years ago, two or three years ago, when I started
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:26.040]   wearing these things.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:29.360]   It really, you'll be shocked at how beautiful this is.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:33.960]   And I found this when I was searching for, I've heard that you guys were talking about
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:40.200]   earbuds to a hearing aid center and they will mold those words.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:41.200]   I do that.
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:45.440]   I mean, wearing very, very expensive in ear headphones, that's exactly what they do.
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.280]   You go to your audiologist and they mold that to your ear.
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.280]   That's what musicians wear.
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:52.280]   Right.
[01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:53.280]   And I've been thinking about doing the same thing.
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.280]   And then I found out, wait, I can do that with Subaru?
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:58.360]   It's like, no, they're not telling me to squirt that stuff in my ear.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:53:59.360]   Like, no, they're not.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.360]   They're telling you to do something that is super super clever.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:06.400]   Very thin little, uh, Subaru snake that you put underneath the silicone, then you put
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:10.080]   it in your ear and it molds the silicone and the Subaru underneath it.
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:13.000]   Once it hardens, that's the shape that the silicone is going to maintain.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000]   Right.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.720]   So it's not like it's like, it's not like a filling in your entire ear canal rubber.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.120]   No, but basically it means that instead, instead of being given that you probably don't have
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:27.560]   a perfectly round ear canal, this will give, it gives it, it gives us enough firmness and
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.560]   it adapts to the shape of your ear.
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:31.320]   So this will be perfectly suited.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:34.040]   It'll be perfect suited to block out outside noise.
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:38.000]   And like if there are people who like looked at the reviews of these headphones after I
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.800]   recommended them as solid, a lot of people say, oh, the sound is tinny and there isn't
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:42.800]   any bass.
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:47.080]   Well, that's someone who didn't, who would just basically put on the pair of earbuds that
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:50.760]   was pre-fabbed on it and did not swap them out for any of the others that were included.
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.760]   Because you have to, you really have to pick on.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:57.400]   And the other, and the other tip is that, uh, don't assume that your ear canals are both
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:00.320]   the same size and shape on each side.
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:04.560]   My left ear was like, I couldn't wear these for more than like two hours, uh, because
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:09.200]   that my left ear was start to hurt because I had the same size earbud, uh, earplugs
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:14.160]   in there that I just, I've now, I switched this, the, the, a slightly large, the smaller
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:15.640]   size of this.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:16.640]   And now that's absolutely.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:22.520]   So you have heterogeneous, heterogeneous ears.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:26.000]   I, I, I, I contain multitudes.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.800]   I never thought of that.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:30.520]   Most people don't, you know, the same thing with their feet.
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:32.320]   Uh, and so, but I never thought of that.
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:36.520]   So, cause I have the same problem and I can't quite get the right fit on those earbuds that
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:41.320]   you recommended, but that may be because I'm, I should have, I might have also have had
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.600]   arogynous ear holes.
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:44.320]   You had a regionius.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:45.320]   How do you say that?
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:46.320]   Had a rogynous?
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:51.120]   How do you, you got to say it right or it sounds wrong.
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.280]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.640]   Good soo grew tip.
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:56.240]   And since you're getting a pack of eight when you buy Sugru.
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:59.120]   And you'll only be using two of those.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:04.360]   Uh, my second suggestion is to watch iOS today last, uh, was it last week when, uh, Megan
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:10.440]   Moroni used Sugru to show you how to make a little handy dandy iPod headphone adapter
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.440]   dongle holder.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:12.440]   Yeah.
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.440]   They're amazing.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:17.680]   And also I mean, you've built, it's a million, a million household uses like you're used
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:23.440]   to like the, I don't know why the, the rubber that Apple uses on their connectors tends
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:25.040]   to rot really, really quickly.
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.720]   We all have like cables we had to throw out because like, don't sugar those.
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:29.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:30.720]   Exactly.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:33.520]   You just wrap Sugru around it even as a preventative measure.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:37.680]   And you can reclaim a $30 cable that's still per electrically, perfectly good.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:39.680]   Uh, and extend the life of a brand new one.
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:43.280]   It's just, like you just buy this again, you'll use one packet.
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:47.000]   It's a little bit wasteful because once you expose one packet air, you have to, it's,
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.520]   this is why, uh, before I did the, the earphone trick, I lined up like here are four other
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:58.480]   things I would like to use Sugru on, including I have these two cables I want to repair.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:01.940]   And I also want to see if I can mold it around one of the hooves of the, one of the whole
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:05.480]   steams toys to see if I can make like a stand for it.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:08.920]   Because because you're going to lose the entire wad of Sugru in this packet is going
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:11.440]   to get, is going to turn into hard rubber.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:13.320]   You may, you have to find things to do.
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:14.320]   Yes.
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:16.440]   It'll go into, it'll all go to waste unless you find something to do it.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:20.040]   So even if you just want to see, I wonder if I could, I wonder if I can stick this old
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:23.240]   TV remote to the, to the, to the cat's collar.
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:24.240]   Wow.
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:25.240]   Apple earnings.
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:26.240]   Sugru, secretly we do that.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.720]   Apple earnings just coming in now.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:28.720]   Right Renee.
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:32.440]   Oh, his mic is muted as well.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.440]   Sorry.
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:34.440]   I apologize.
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:35.440]   You're doing good.
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:40.920]   I think, uh, he's doing more podcasts about the earnings as he's doing two podcasts at
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.920]   once.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:48.200]   46.9 billion of quarterly net income, uh, 1.67 diluted shares, uh, where are the numbers,
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:50.720]   uh, trying to find the iPhone numbers.
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:53.720]   Um, I think the, oh, here we go.
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:58:03.160]   So, uh, 4.5, sorry, 45.5 million iPhones, uh, 9.3 million iPads, 2.4 bill, uh, 4.9 million
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:06.080]   Macs, sorry, 9.3 million iPads, 4.9 million Macs.
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:07.840]   So they made a little bit of money again.
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:10.480]   They, they beat the street once again.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:11.480]   Yep.
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:15.160]   So maybe the, uh, maybe the iPhone estimates.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:16.400]   They're very good at that.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.400]   They always, they always seem to beat the street.
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.120]   Renee, your, your pick of the week.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:25.680]   So I, I have to, I was going to pick the AirPods, but we talked about those so much that I
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.680]   don't want to dominate the conversation.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:28.920]   No, no, no, we haven't had your review.
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:29.920]   Give us a review.
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:32.320]   There, no, so I, I put a link in there.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:37.240]   I did a first impressions because I'm using a pre-production hardware on pre-production
[01:58:37.240 --> 01:58:38.240]   software.
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:42.400]   So it's not a final review, but, uh, I've, I've really loved them from everything from
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:47.600]   outdoor walking to, um, to, to, you know, using them in the car, using them while walking
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:48.600]   around.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:50.240]   They've just been absolutely fantastic for me.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:53.880]   Um, I didn't think I'd like them because air, earbuds have traditionally not stayed
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:57.440]   in my ears, but because of the lack of cord, uh, they've worked great.
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:58.880]   The sound has been good enough for me.
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:01.840]   The microphone has been exceptional for people who I'm talking to.
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:05.640]   Uh, but the real, the, the really good thing is that W1 chip that once you connect it
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:10.480]   to your iPhone, that connection propagates to your Apple watch, to your iPad, uh, and
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.480]   to your Mac.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:14.880]   It doesn't do that with the Apple TV yet because that's a multi person device, not a single
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.640]   person device, but they're Bluetooth.
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:20.920]   So you can connect them to your Apple TV, to your Android phone, to all of those things.
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:21.920]   But it really just shines.
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:22.920]   Like I'm using them on my Mac now.
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:23.920]   I didn't have to do anything.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:24.920]   It was just there.
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:28.200]   Uh, I hit the button and it just worked and I've done that with my iPad.
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:29.400]   I've done that with my Apple watch.
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:32.880]   Uh, so it's, it's, they, they stay in sync really well.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:36.440]   And I think anybody who's been looking for a good pair, uh, if you're into sports, you
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:38.440]   might know, I've whipped my head around and they've fallen out.
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:39.680]   They haven't fallen out of normal use.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:44.560]   Uh, so maybe like the Apple has the beats ones available already with the W one chip and
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:46.160]   there'll be more on the market soon.
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:50.120]   So you can, you will have options available, but for anyone who's just looking for, it's
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:53.720]   right there, just looking for something to take, you know, something wireless, something
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:55.600]   to, to cut the cord with.
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:56.600]   I think they're fantastic.
[01:59:56.600 --> 02:00:00.480]   Uh, and I also wanted to briefly mention portrait mode because that shipped yesterday.
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:01.480]   That was going to be my pick.
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:02.480]   So stop.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.480]   Oh, sorry.
[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:04.480]   I'm going to stop right there.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:06.640]   Leave something for the rest of us.
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:10.800]   They'll be on sale this week, uh, and I recommend them.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:11.800]   We, they have to be right.
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:14.080]   You don't have any, or do you have inside knowledge?
[02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:17.360]   Uh, and then Apple said end of October and this is the end of October.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.360]   Hold them to it.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.360]   Yeah.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:20.360]   I will.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:21.360]   I can't wait to get one.
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:26.880]   So I, I wanted to mention that if you have an updated Sierra, uh, OS, iOS, Mac OS, watch
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:33.960]   OS, all of the OS is were updated yesterday and, uh, we got 10.1 on iOS and that came with
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:34.960]   a new portrait motor.
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:39.840]   Uh, actually I want to do this in conjunction with you Renee because I have lots of questions.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.040]   So first of all, it says it's beta, right?
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:43.040]   Yes.
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:48.440]   So the way you can get into it is as with, uh, all of the special effects and photos,
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:49.440]   but there's a new one now.
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:53.840]   You'll see portrait and, uh, and you have to be how far it says move farther away.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:55.720]   How far away do you have to be to get portrait?
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:56.720]   I think it's eight.
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:00.040]   And like I've done it in less than that, but I think eight feet is what it also wants
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:01.040]   from you.
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:03.520]   And then now this is, I'll show you some images.
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:07.040]   This is the one, uh, we actually updated it on iOS today.
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:09.320]   This is a picture Megan took of me.
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:14.760]   And the whole point is like with a DSLR, you get the foreground in crisp focus, but they
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:17.040]   blur the background somehow.
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:18.440]   Here's, here's one.
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:19.800]   Now I'm saving both.
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:22.560]   So this is without portrait turned on and with.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:24.200]   So you could see the difference.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:29.640]   And for instance, this is a good example that ugly spray cannon rag to over Megan's right
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.880]   shoulder, he kind of disappears when you turn on a portrait mode.
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:35.880]   Um, I did one.
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:41.240]   I think a great picture of Lisa, you can portrait mode because it looks more like a DSLR, right?
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:45.240]   It's, uh, because that's kind of one of the distinguishing features, the shallow depth
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:46.440]   of field of DSLR.
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:50.640]   Now here's how I posited that it works and you're going to correct me.
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:53.280]   So my theory is you've got two lenses.
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:59.320]   So what it looks like is the foreground is the telephoto, the 56 millimeter lens.
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:00.320]   And that's it.
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.360]   They make that perfect focus at the same time they capture.
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:06.760]   I'm assuming an image with the second lens and they can make that one out of focus and
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:08.000]   then they just merge the two.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.520]   That's not how it works apparently.
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:14.640]   No, so it's, it's sort of what they do is they use, um, it is using mainly the portrait
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:21.160]   lens, the, um, the, the, sorry, the, uh, 2.8 aperture portrait lens on the iPhone.
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:24.040]   So the second of the, of the dual camera, that's why you have to be eight feet away because
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:27.160]   it's, it's using the tele relatively telephoto lens.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:28.160]   Absolutely.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:32.640]   And then you need light because that lens is not as low as the, yeah, as the 1.8 aperture
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:35.880]   lens, uh, but they really want you to think of this as one lens system.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:37.640]   They don't want you to think of it as it's got two lenses.
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:41.200]   Yes, but they want, they're using it like one camera system and they're abstracting a
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:42.240]   lot of it away.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.120]   So it takes that picture and then it compares the two and it uses that to create a depth
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:47.120]   map.
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.040]   And I think Matthew, Matthew Panzerino from TechCrunch said it's a nine layered depth map
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:55.560]   and then they apply a custom disc blur to that depth map, but they do it gradually.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:58.840]   So items that are closer get less blur than items that are further away.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:03.120]   So it does create more of a natural looking blur filter and you can feel it'll get warm
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:06.440]   because it's pegging about a 10 processor to do all that, that disc blur.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:10.120]   So it's actually, so it's doing a lot more than I thought it was.
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:12.040]   Why don't they just do it like I said?
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:16.480]   Well, I mean, so this is just the beginning, like it's in beta, but they're doing like,
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:17.480]   it must try it.
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:20.800]   It's called portrait mode and not depth effect because it's really optimized for faces right
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:21.800]   now.
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:24.280]   It does a lot of facial detection and pets because pets have faces.
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:27.960]   It does a lot of facial detection to try to find the edges and it's better.
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.200]   It's obviously better with faces.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:32.920]   It's really bad with reflection still because it can't tell the reflected image from the
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.520]   background, but it's got its strengths and weaknesses.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.680]   But it's like you said, Lee, it's that emotional effect.
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:41.480]   And they even did a lot of work on how they show the noise, like the grain that they apply
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.160]   to the noise to make it look more like sort of an old school picture that you'd get on
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:50.040]   a dimly lit, you know, New York street corner or something, then what we're used to with
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:51.040]   digital photography.
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.480]   And it really is about focusing your eye on what matters to you and getting pictures of
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:57.880]   things that you really like and not a technical thing.
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:59.880]   They really wanted to be sort of an emotional effect.
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:01.720]   Well, and here's an example.
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:07.120]   If you look at this image I took of Megan, this is without portrait on and with it, of
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.480]   course, the background gets put, but look at her necklace.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.200]   That's also getting blurred.
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:13.320]   The microphone is also getting blurred.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:17.520]   What's not, it's doing face recognition and saying this is the thing not to get blurred.
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:22.240]   So if I had just looked more closely at the image I was using, I would have seen, oh,
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:25.360]   yes, it's clearly not a two layer image.
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:27.520]   It's doing more than that.
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:28.520]   Yeah.
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:32.520]   And you'll find you'll find errors if you look for them, but the idea is like it's sort
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:35.440]   of like you love the people that you love and they always look great to you is that if
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:39.240]   it has a lot of emotional impact, you're more forgiving about the little areas in it.
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:43.640]   So the people who love it tend to be the more emotional photographers right now.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:47.480]   And this was something that wouldn't be possible without a two lens system and a 56 millimeter
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:51.160]   yeah, and it'd be easier if the lenses were further apart.
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:53.080]   I mean, because then they get greater depth information.
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:55.880]   So it's what they're working with.
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:59.240]   Also, I think Apple made a very smart decision by default.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:05.440]   It will actually write to storage an unmodified photo and one with the depth effects so that
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:08.880]   if you don't like the depth effect image, you still have a perfectly good image, but
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:14.360]   exactly what it would have taken with the two X lens on its own.
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:15.920]   We wrap things up with.
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:16.920]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:21.560]   Andy, I knew you would be able to explain this in a better way than I was.
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:26.800]   And I do want to wrap it up with a final note of congratulation to our colleague Brian
[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:31.720]   Lamb who created a site we all love, the wire cutter.
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:36.880]   Self invested, he bootstrapped it with his own money, made what a site that we have all
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:41.240]   referred to many times is the place to go if you want to find out what the best whatever
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:42.240]   is.
[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:46.200]   And also created a home product version of this.
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:52.320]   And yesterday it was announced they had sold the wire cutter and it's a sweet home partner
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:56.480]   to the New York Times for $30 million.
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:05:58.680]   And it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:00.320]   Everybody loves Brian Lamb.
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:03.960]   He left his motto to create the wire cutter and bootstrapped it with his own money.
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:09.880]   So I'm thinking he's getting some big chunk of change for that, which is fantastic.
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:12.480]   But I think the Times is probably going to be a good steward of this.
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:17.880]   We want to see it continue and continue to do the really great work they do.
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:20.800]   I guess Brian is sticking around by the way.
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:25.600]   So in fact he had, they tweeted, Hey, we're still us.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:28.520]   We're just part of the New York Times now.
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:29.760]   So congratulations, Brian.
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:31.240]   That's really great news.
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:35.320]   Andy and I co Chicago Sun Times, C W O B dot com always a thrill.
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:36.320]   Thank you for being here.
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:37.480]   Don't forget Andy's other podcast.
[02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:44.360]   He mentioned he does one about Andrey called material on replay dot at FM.
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:50.360]   You can also hear now it goes all Manek on five by five.tv should should make a note.
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:51.880]   The the Enocha Almanac is ending.
[02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:54.160]   I'm going for the third to the last episode.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:07:00.360]   There are two more and there, but there is a new show that's going to be starting on
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:04.920]   relay FM that I hope the people who like the Enocha Almanac will like just as much.
[02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:05.920]   Nice.
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:07.920]   So stay tuned.
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:11.080]   If you unsubscribe because you had not seen it in episode in four months, you might want
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:15.920]   to resubscribe because there will be two episodes that will explain what's going on.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:19.560]   Well, I'm glad I mentioned it then.
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:20.560]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:24.800]   Renee Richie does more podcasts than God, although he says fewer all the time.
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:28.040]   And when I say what I say, God, I mean me.
[02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.600]   No, I don't.
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:31.240]   That was terrible.
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:36.640]   Go to imore.com and you can of course see all the stuff that Renee Richie does and find
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:43.240]   more of his audio stuff when you click the hamburger menu and select podcasts, including
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:47.520]   their brand and new one, Apple Talk, which is a really great and must listen to show for
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.080]   anybody's into Apple stuff.
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:52.080]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:53.560]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:55.520]   Thank you all for being here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:01.800]   I want to say we'll be back next Tuesday, but even before then, we'll be back on Thursday.
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:02.800]   I won't be here.
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:06.160]   I'm going to be watching, but not participating to our live coverage of the Apple streaming
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:07.160]   event.
[02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:14.520]   They'll announce we think new max tune in a little before 10 AM Pacific.
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:17.680]   That's 1 PM Eastern 1700 UTC.
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:19.240]   Andy, you'll be here.
[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:26.680]   And when I get in, I'm going to be here and I've forgotten again who will be the third
[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:27.680]   person.
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:28.680]   What?
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:29.680]   What?
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:31.840]   It doesn't matter.
[02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:33.920]   Tune in Alex Lindsay.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:34.920]   Alex Lindsay.
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:35.920]   Why did I forget you, Alex?
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:36.920]   I'm sorry.
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:38.320]   We'll look forward to that.
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:44.120]   And we'll be back 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time next Tuesday to analysis everything that
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:45.120]   Apple announced.
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.200]   And maybe I'll be back with a new Macbook Pro.
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:48.200]   That would be nice.
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:52.080]   I'd love to do boxing on this show.
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:55.920]   If you can't watch live, you can always join us on demand.
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:58.920]   Twitter.tv/MBW or wherever you subscribe to podcast.
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:00.280]   Make sure you get every episode.
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:01.760]   You don't want to miss a one.
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:05.560]   But now I'm sad to say it's time to get back to work because you know why?
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:09.560]   Steve Gibson's waiting in the wings and break time is over.
