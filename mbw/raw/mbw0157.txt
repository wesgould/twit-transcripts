[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.200]   >> Hi, this is Leo Laporte and it's time for Mac Break Weekly
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.840]   a little bit different episode today.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.280]   We got together to watch live as the new iPods were announced.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.840]   The Apple, it's only rock and roll to me event in San Francisco.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.080]   None of us got invitations to go, but that didn't matter.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.160]   We decided we could cover it using the internet and I think we did a pretty good job.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.400]   If you want to hear the excitement as it happens live with John Syracuse of ours,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.400]   Technica Andy Anatko who joins us a little bit later into the show
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.920]   from the Chicago Sun Times, Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.680]   We even sent Dane Gold and our intrepid president out to the event.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.360]   He was standing outside and snagged Ryan Block of GDGT and Brad Stone of the New York Times
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.760]   and got their thoughts as well.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.560]   That's what's coming up.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.400]   It's a special edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.760]   We join our coverage already in progress.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.360]   >> All right.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.800]   And I'm looking for a live audio feed link and it looks like we do have one.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.760]   So let me see if I can pull that up.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.520]   That would be great.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.280]   These are of course illicit and get shut down.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.400]   >> So we won't tell you where we got it.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.160]   >> As soon as Apple, people in the auditorium figure out.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.960]   >> Yes, because last year it was 3,000 apps, now it's 75,000 apps.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.760]   Little off, people have downloaded 1.8 billion at the B.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.480]   >> So this is, here we go.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.440]   Looks like we're--
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.640]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.560]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.600]   >> Wait a minute, it's in German.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.320]   >> And it's good for free previews.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.400]   >> Is that a problem?
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.640]   >> They're giving German commentary on top of it.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.320]   >> Okay, this isn't the actual audio, although they have a video.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   So I'll tell you what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the video.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.560]   They don't have apparently audio or they-- because it's in English, they don't want
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   the audio.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.600]   So I'm going to just take the video off of this until we find an audio stream.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.240]   I sure like to get an audio stream of this.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.480]   >> We'll watch the video stream anyway.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.960]   >> So they're adding ringtones from major labels.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.240]   Do we really buy ringtones?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.560]   >> No, that's all about money for the carrier, don't you think?
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   In fact, it seems silly with that because they've been allowing you to make ringtones
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.760]   for some time for unprotected music.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.560]   So I don't really understand the value of that.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.360]   I mean, it's so easy to build in GarageBand, it doesn't really make sense.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.680]   >> I'm going to get Dane on.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.480]   Dane is out front.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.080]   We didn't put anybody inside.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.600]   We didn't do an embedded reporter because we didn't think that person would be able
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.360]   to communicate with the world.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.240]   So we'll talk to people after as they come out, including Ryan Block of GDGT.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   >> So the new iPhone 3.1 is available.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.560]   It's going to allow a lot of the augmented reality stuff that we've been waiting for.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   >> Right.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.080]   So you think this is not that we're not watching, what we're watching is not live video.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.040]   >> Looks like, still, images coming off.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.880]   >> It's not far off if it's not live.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.200]   >> I think even the pictures are behind the feeds that I'm looking at.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.440]   I'm looking at the R-stack thing, live feed, and they're already talking about iTunes 9.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.440]   >> So we'll move along.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.360]   I think that that may not be the one.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.720]   Here's a new 9.1.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.560]   Genius mixes people have submitted over 27 million libraries, each about 2K songs, 54 billion
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.200]   songs, analyzed all of them, Genius Database, smarter, iTunes 9.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.440]   So we're looking at iTunes 9.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   100 million accounts.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.440]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   >> Here's Dane.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.440]   I've got Dane here.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   Let me get your audio up, Dane.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440]   >> Check one.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.680]   >> Hey, Dane, we hear you.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680]   >> Great.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.920]   >> Dane, where are you?
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.640]   >> How's that, how's that, Emmett?
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.200]   >> I'm right here, Leo, in front of the Yorba Boyna Center for the Arts.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.400]   The journalists have just gone in at 9.53.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.440]   They entered the building for the announcements.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.000]   >> All right, so we're watching now live streaming coverage.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.160]   That's interesting.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.600]   GDGT just said live coverage is now over on their site.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   I don't know.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.120]   Maybe they got found out.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.960]   Ryan pushed the wrong button.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.640]   >> Do you guys use the Genius mixes at all?
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.400]   >> I never do, although I know people would do.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.240]   John, are you a fan of the Genius?
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.880]   >> The problem is that all my music doesn't exist on the iTunes store, so if I ask it,
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.720]   what do other people who listen to this music listen to it, I have no idea.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.480]   So no, I've never used it.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   >> Right.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.560]   What do you listen to, John?
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.400]   Would you believe video game remix music?
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.000]   >> Yes, I would.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> And mashups?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   >> And mashups.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   >> All of which don't exist on the iTunes.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   >> No, of course not.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.360]   I'm really glad to have John on today.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.480]   I wanted to get him on last week and I emailed a MindSpring account that he hasn't had for
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.720]   years, so I apologize, John, for not getting you on sooner, but I'm glad you could be
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   on that part of this.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.000]   >> No, I kept that account for years thinking, "Oh, a lot of people have this email address.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I better keep it.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   It'll be such a pain to get rid of it."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.520]   And eventually I just got rid of it and look what happens.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.520]   >> I have no idea.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.520]   >> I have no idea why I had it, to be honest with you.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   I must have done it.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.800]   >> I've been on the show before, and that was the address you just back then.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.360]   >> So it was way back when?
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.360]   >> There you go.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.000]   >> Before the eighth Skype video.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.840]   >> Where are you, John?
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.920]   >> I'm in Boston, Newton, Massachusetts, outside Boston.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.920]   >> Great.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.280]   >> And we're going to hear from Andy, who is at right now at a briefing of some kind.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   There we go, and Gadget now has refreshed.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.280]   >> See, Andy's at the briefing.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   Not me.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   No, he's actually a different briefing.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.120]   He's at some sort of tablet briefing, not the Apple briefing.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.280]   So we're applying that same tech to something new called Genius Mixes.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.640]   Imagine a Genius DJ that plays endless mixes of songs from your iTunes library that go
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.880]   great together, almost like a radio station.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.000]   iTunes will make up 12 mixes based off the music in your library.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.600]   Manage your apps in iTunes finally.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.400]   I don't know what that means.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   So this is great.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.120]   Those who are just tuning in, Steve Jobs is on stage doing the demo, looking extremely
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.120]   --
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.280]   >> Oh, this is thinner than before.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   >> This is really big.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.560]   This is actually something I was thinking about talking about.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.920]   So they're going to let you have tabs where you can manage your applications and arrange
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   your application.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.120]   Because I spent literally a half an hour trying to get -- it's like playing that little
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   square game, ready to make a pattern.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.400]   Moving all my apps around so I had them on the right screens, and it looks like what
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.760]   you're able to do now is decide, you know, just drag them all in where you want them.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.080]   But evidently, I did that one week too early.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.800]   >> Oh, you mean on the phone?
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   I spent a lot of time talking about it.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   >> But you can now be an iTunes.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   So you can now be an iTunes and organize what pain has what applications rather than trying
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.960]   to do it on the iPhone, which is just -- if you have 10 pages, which is what I have,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.680]   nearly full, it turns into quite a process.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.440]   >> Yeah, I hit those little wiggly icons.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.480]   It's like a torture test trying to drag them from one screen to the next.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.640]   >> I bet you guys are pretty cool.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.640]   >> Shaking, it's horrible.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.880]   >> Well, I'm pretty good at it, but out of lots and lots of pain.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.160]   >> Hey, Dane, we're getting a lot of splash from the sun, which is washing out your picture
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.160]   quite a bit.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.520]   So you might eat until your lid down or move to somewhere where the sun is not shining
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.520]   right in the camera.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.520]   >> How's that?
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   >> That's better.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.600]   >> I may have to switch locations.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.440]   >> I would just, you know, once the sun goes behind that building, you're not going
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   to have a problem.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.880]   >> Could you not send me video so I can send you video and save a little battery?
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   >> Thank you.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.200]   >> And tell me if I need to move at any point.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   >> I think you're fine.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.680]   >> So we're just going to leave Dane there.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.280]   If anything exciting happens.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.000]   So he comes running out of the auditorium in flames.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.880]   Dane will be there to catch it.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.880]   And we'll keep that picture.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.800]   >> Just some gourmet coffee, Leo, a couple of badges, a couple of all the people with
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   it.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.000]   >> He's on a, he's on a MyFi by the way.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   >> I did.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.960]   >> Important looking side pretty guard.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.480]   Best reception here at the year, but wait on the center of the arts.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:05.440]   >> Bob Dylan, now he's showing on the iTunes store.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.040]   I love this app reorganization.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.560]   That is fantastic.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.720]   Look at that.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.960]   That's going to be, that's a big improvement.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.440]   >> Said I just, I just want those, those two hours back in my life, you know, get everything
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440]   all going on.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   >> Oh man.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.920]   So Genius Mixes improved syncing.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.640]   I don't know what that means.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.920]   Home sharing, redesigned store and iTunes LP.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.000]   This is going to be the cocktail that they were talking about.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.840]   Can you describe what cocktail is?
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.920]   >> From what I've heard, it's their attempt to sort of add value.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.520]   Instead of just getting the audio tracks, you get what you would normally get an album,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.320]   liner notes, big pictures.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.200]   I mean, you know, it's just a extensible format for adding more than just the audio to what
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   you purchase.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.400]   >> It looks like we're, we're, this is, we're looking at American Beauty, the Grateful Dead
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   Album.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.040]   And you get a gallery, videos, liner notes, credits, a track list.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.760]   Those actually look like some, some really good looking artwork.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.680]   I, I'm not familiar enough with American Beauty to know if that's original there, what we're
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.080]   looking at now, or something from the original LP.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.520]   >> Well, they can sell you both.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.480]   You see, you can have the version with the original album art and you can buy that.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.600]   And then, you know, six months later, they can give you a version with new album art,
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.640]   you know, it's the same thing as selling new DVDs with new extras.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.840]   >> Ah, yeah, exactly.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.040]   These are like extras, aren't they?
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.440]   >> What I'd be really interested to see is if, if you can now, with movies, it'd be great
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.160]   to actually get the DVD extras, you know, so that when you're buying something that you
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.160]   could get the, you know, the extra special effects pieces or the interviews for those
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.360]   of you, for those people who want them.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:40.240]   >> I, I, I, Trooper, who is apparently a deadhead tells us in the chat room that that
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.160]   is in fact the original album artwork.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.960]   Now we've gone on stage and Jeff is demoing.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.720]   Jeff, who, who is that?
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.240]   >> It's Jeff Robin.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.240]   >> Jeff Robin.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.560]   >> So this is a live demo of what we were seeing as slides before.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.800]   I'm loving this application management.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   That's fantastic.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.480]   >> Yeah, that's a great and it was, I mean, it was exactly something that I was just,
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.680]   I finally decided I just can't randomly have these applications everywhere.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.000]   There's just too many of them.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.280]   And being able to drag those out and build groups and turn ones on and off, it's a,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.040]   that's a, that's definitely a, a must have.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.400]   >> They're telling me in the chat room that it looked like from the picture, those 30,000
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.800]   ringtones will be free, which would be very nice.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.080]   If anybody in the chat room, we're still looking for audio from the, from the, it's
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.000]   not German commentary.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.040]   That's just a German version of what we're doing.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.560]   But actual audio from the, the conference hall, we'd love to get that.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.120]   Apple's, Apple doesn't, oh, I'm sorry, 129 each.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120]   Okay.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.600]   So those ringtones are still stupidly priced at $1.29.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.480]   >> The stupid, the, the stupid price is $1.29.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.480]   >> Yes.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.360]   >> I guess if some, some people, you know, have more money than time.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.000]   So that would, I guess.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.200]   >> It's what the market will bear.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   People buy these ringtones.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   >> I know some dollars worth.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.400]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.200]   But I think that part of the thing is people who buy them a lot, buy them for phones.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.880]   And it's, it's a lot more work to get them onto the phones and get them converted and
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.840]   get, do all the stuff with an iPhone.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.440]   It's just so nothing to make it on your end garage band.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   >> You know that.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440]   I know that.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.240]   >> Right.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.200]   Now everybody watching knows, knows that.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.640]   Danielle says that, no, that's Macworld, Danielle, but I'm, I'm glad you're enjoying
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.440]   the Macworld speech, but it's not the current one.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.680]   Apple does that.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.240]   Usually they'll put up the audio and video of the speech after the fact, but we're in
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.400]   too much hurry.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.160]   John Syracuse, from ours, Technica is with us.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.440]   Alex Lindsey, Andy and Akko will join us in just about 45 minutes and we'll actually
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.040]   begin a Mac break weekly then.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.240]   We're doing right now live coverage of the Apple announcements at San Francisco at the.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.960]   >> So the home sharing looks actually pretty interesting.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.840]   If you have a, if you're somebody, you can, you can now share the movies and music between
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.320]   five computers and they can see each other and you transfer purchases too.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.720]   >> So really it turns every computer into almost an Apple TV.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.520]   >> And automatically sync the new purchase.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.200]   >> Yeah, you can sync new purchases over.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.920]   >> So how many more years do we have to wait for them to do that to the rest of our life?
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.840]   >> You know, because a family has one set of photos, you know, I had photos from mom
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.840]   photos for dad.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.440]   A family has one iTunes library, one set of photos and it's such a pain to have to say,
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.480]   oh, you know, I can't put those photos in because they're on your mother's account and
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.480]   not on your account.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.360]   >> Daniel's telling us in the chat room that he saw a number of tweets from journalists
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.520]   saying that Dajne Harrison was in San Francisco this morning.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.200]   George Harrison's is that son or daughter?
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   So that's interesting.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.520]   Jeff Robin, by the way, is the guy who wrote iTunes originally.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.000]   So that's a good person to demonstrate the new features in iTunes.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.960]   >> The guy who wrote Soundjam or the guy who turned it into iTunes.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.320]   Yeah, because Soundjam was the original.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.760]   You know, iTunes was not, most notably, not updated to a cocoa in Snow Leopard.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.480]   And it's my understanding that iTunes, a lot of iTunes is an Apple script so that it might
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.520]   not be such a trivial thing to rewrite that in cocoa.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.920]   >> Well, the thing about iTunes is that it runs on Windows too and the way they got it
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.080]   onto Windows was bringing over a lot of the carbon framework, porting that to Windows.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.840]   So if they port iTunes to cocoa, that really doesn't help them on Windows.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.480]   So do they keep the Windows one based on carbon and do a new Mac one based on cocoa?
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.760]   You know, the fact that they haven't said anything about it now makes me think it's
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   still carbon.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.400]   >> Yeah, that's a big rewrite.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.560]   >> I don't know how big it is.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.440]   I mean, presumably they've been doing it for years.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.280]   Like they knew this was coming before anyone else did.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.040]   So it's not like they haven't had time.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.480]   >> But you'd have to write it from scratch on the Windows side, right?
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.520]   >> Well, maybe you leave Windows on the old code base.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.520]   >> Ah, that's true.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   You should always do that.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.320]   >> There's no one complaining about the lack of 64-bit iTunes on the Windows side.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.840]   I don't think so.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   >> No, I don't think so.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   Well, you never know.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.840]   Windows is moving pretty aggressively, 64-bits.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.080]   So it's possible.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.360]   Now what are we looking at?
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   We're looking at...
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.240]   >> Facebook sharing, I think.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.080]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   There it is.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.760]   Sharon Facebook, Sharon Twitter, gift this album, add to Wishlist, telefriend, or copy link.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.280]   So this is the social media elements that we were expecting in iTunes 9.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.080]   We're looking at the iTunes 9 update.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.800]   Looks like you could share iPhone apps, too, I'm seeing on our chatroom.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   So this is an update.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.160]   It looks like to the iTunes Store, not to iTunes itself, but to the Store itself.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   It would be great to be able to...
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.080]   >> The Apple Store has been done all morning, yeah.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.840]   So whatever has happened, and that's pretty much expected.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.640]   But yeah, the Apple Store has been done all morning.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.160]   I checked it at about 8 a.m. Pacific time, two hours before the event began, it was done.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.560]   Tony Wang is in the house.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.560]   Yes, Tony.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.560]   >> Oh.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560]   >> Are they?
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.040]   Because that's been widespread, it's very easy to do.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.360]   What's the hack?
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.800]   >> There's a hack to turn on tethering on the iPhone.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.280]   It's actually a very easy hack to do.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.040]   You just create a new profile.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   And there's Daniel.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.360]   >> What's going on, Dane?
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   Anything exciting?
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.440]   I see his head.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.880]   >> Yeah. Leo, a woman in a stroller just pushed her child by.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.880]   >> Fascinate.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.680]   The latest from in front of the event.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.240]   A lady in a stroller, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.720]   She has no idea what's going on inside that building.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.360]   Now he's playing a Dors song, and there are the lyrics, which is great.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.760]   This is something that really was missing from digital music.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.960]   And only old timers like me really remember it.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.960]   >> It is.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   So it's like...
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   And this has been...
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   >> I'm glad to do it with this.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.160]   Because at your fingertips, it's a simple Google and you find the lyrics for the most
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.160]   obscure songs.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.560]   I'm not even sure who puts those in.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.320]   >> Well, in fact, the music publishers were trying to shut those lyrics sites down.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.360]   They thought that was a violation of their rights.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.360]   >> I first put...
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.160]   I was a lyrics website as a matter of fact.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.600]   So if you're wondering who puts them up, it's me.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   >> It's fans.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   >> Fingers.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   >> Oh, really?
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   Were they video game lyrics?
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   >> No.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   >> They were...
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   They were you two lyrics as a matter of fact.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.440]   And I took years to be contacted by their record label.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.240]   Like for years, they were pretty much hands off.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.080]   But I think it was maybe five years ago, the record label just figured it out.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.800]   And they said, "Oh, you can't have these up.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   Copyright blah, blah, blah."
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.200]   The best part is when they launched their own website, youtube.com.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.120]   They copied and pasted my lyrics.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.080]   With the typos.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.080]   I could match them up based on where I transposed characters and stuff.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.040]   That's how they seeded their lyrics.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   >> That's appalling.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.040]   Oh, that's appalling.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   >> Well, they have the copyrights.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.640]   We're just a bunch of leeches, right?
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.640]   That's sad.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.160]   >> Well, it's nice to have the little more album collateral, I have to say, because that
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.320]   was a missing experience.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.880]   It didn't make sense in the first typos.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.560]   You didn't have enough screen real estate with the touches and the phone.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.200]   You have the real estate to do something like this.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.080]   I guess on the computer, you've always had it.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.560]   But how many people sit in front of their computer and listen to music?
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.560]   >> Well, I don't...
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.120]   >> I'm staring at visualizer, I guess.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.120]   Who uses...
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.800]   I love the visualizer, but it's cool.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.080]   But honestly, does anybody use the visualizer?
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.040]   You always turn it on the first time you show someone iTunes and then you go and then you
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.880]   do the visualizer and then you put that up there and then you move on.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.880]   Johnny, you have visual...
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.880]   >> Yeah, Marty or something.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.880]   >> Yeah, for part.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.880]   I remember...
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880]   >> You can't...
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:17.040]   >> In 1999, the New Year's Eve, 2000, I used WinApp and the visualizer and projected it
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.400]   on the wall.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.240]   Aaron says, "My mother uses it."
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.000]   There you go, Aaron.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.400]   Proof positive.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.640]   This is from GDGT.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.480]   This is their feed of pictures that Brian Block and Peter Rojas doing a great job double
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.200]   teeming the conference.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.440]   He says, "Showing iTunes LP."
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.440]   That's what they're calling cocktails, iTunes LP.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.600]   Lots of interactivity, lyrics, huge images, chronology, memorabilia, the photos are amazing.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.200]   >> Well, something does look like they're adding more extras to the movies as well.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   >> Yeah, this is...
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.480]   >> The iTunes extras for movies.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.800]   So, Wally, for example, has all sorts of extra features, exclusive features, bot files.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   >> That's fantastic.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.960]   >> He says it's definitely reminiscent of DVD Blu-ray extra features.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.280]   So, that's what you were asking for, Alex.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.280]   >> Yep.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.440]   I'm happy.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.000]   >> Jim Goldman obviously had a scoop because I saw him this morning.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.520]   I'm an MSNBC and he said, "On a quivocally, Steve Jobs will be at this event."
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.840]   Steve Jobs not only at the event, he is giving the presentation.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.080]   He's handed it over, at least temporarily, to Jeff Robin, the author of iTunes to demonstrate
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.080]   iTunes.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.120]   But he's there.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.120]   And giving the presentation in traditional form.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.400]   Looking pretty thin in the pictures, thinner than even in October when he was last on stage.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.440]   Looks like just like we have LP for music, we have extra for movies.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.000]   Here's one for Wally.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.160]   You see chapters, you see features, you see more.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   This is really...
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:49.960]   >> This is why the DVD battle between Blu-ray and HD DVD was a terrible, futile, puric victory
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.120]   for Blu-ray.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.400]   It just slowed down adoption of HD DVDs.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.320]   It's long enough so that online versions could catch up.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   I've stopped.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.320]   I had a PlayStation.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.320]   I started buying Blu-ray discs.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   And about...
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.960]   Man, probably eight or nine months ago I just stopped.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.480]   I was like, "I can download what I need."
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.600]   Phil Schiller now walking up on stage.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.960]   That's interesting because Phil...
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.160]   Well, Phil's a marketing guy so he could talk about anything.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.880]   But doesn't Phil usually talk about Max?
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.320]   I did hear one rumor that there might be a new Mac mini, a pretty solid rumor from somebody
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.280]   inside that there might be a Mac mini announced today.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.440]   I'd love to see a new Apple TV.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:36.400]   We also saw Yoko Ono accidentally leaking to a Sky TV that there would be a Beatles on
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:44.800]   iTunes and then EMI issuing an absolute denial saying, "Someday, not tomorrow."
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.880]   Here's Phil Schiller with a graph.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.480]   I'm sorry, 220 million iPod sold to date.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.040]   He says it's one of the most successful products in the history of all products.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.520]   73.8% market share.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.520]   The biggest category.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.000]   The next biggest category he says, "Other."
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.040]   "Other, of course, concludes Zoom."
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:16.640]   And next week, Microsoft will ship its Zoom HD, which looks to be a very exciting device.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.960]   But will it be enough to beat whatever Apple announces today?
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.240]   I've been thinking about getting a Zoom.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.240]   Thinking.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.280]   I'll show you mine when the time is...
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.040]   I like the idea of being able to just fill it up with a bunch of random stuff and listen
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.360]   to it and then fill it up with some...
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.160]   Literally, if iTunes added the subscription model, I'd be dying.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.160]   I agree with you.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.080]   I think the subscription model is what makes the Zoom.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:45.600]   If a 32 gigabyte Zoom HD that you can fill with anything is very compelling.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:53.920]   He says, "Grate of 50% of something new to iPod, I guess, purchasers."
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.360]   That answers the question a lot of people had, which is, "Can you sell more iPods?
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.000]   Have we not saturated?"
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.800]   20 million iPod touches sold.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.280]   That's what every two years your iPod breaks, right?
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.880]   Or you lose it or the battery goes dead or you step on it or you go through the watch.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.640]   So this cost in place comes out.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.640]   It's like cars.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.600]   Have we saturated the market for cars?
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   Like it's not.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   People always buying your cars.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   I guess not.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   I guess it would...
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.720]   You'd think it would slow down though a little bit, but you're right.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.560]   Even if it's not every two years, it's every few years.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.240]   I think I end up buying one almost every year.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.400]   How many of us have more than one?
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   Let's face it.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.200]   Many, many more than one.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.720]   They'd be many more than one.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.320]   My wife and I both have an iPhone.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.320]   My kids have iPhones.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:45.880]   And then I have the Nano and a...and whatever the real tiny one is, the shuffle and a classic.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.080]   I think it's all the ones that I have left.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   I've lost a couple of classics.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.520]   So 30 million iPhones, 20 million iPod touches, that's 50 million for that form factor.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.160]   Herndon has pointed out in her chatroom that that's pretty impressive.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.480]   And you're doing okay.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.680]   Web 381, I had to sign an NDA with Microsoft.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.680]   I didn't want to.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.360]   I didn't want to do it, but they made me.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.800]   I was already in the room and then they said, "Oh, by the way, this is NDA."
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.400]   And I said, "Okay."
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.160]   It's only for another week.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   Not even that.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.160]   Another five days.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.640]   And since Apple didn't invite me to this event, I thought, "Well, I guess I'll shift
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.320]   my allegiance entirely."
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.720]   No, just kidding.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   You may...
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   I'm not that cheap.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   You may...
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.320]   If they're going to bribe you, it's going to take more than a portable music player.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.440]   You may ask why, he says, Phil Schiller says, "Why 20 million?
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.240]   We think the things that set it apart.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.240]   It's a great iPod.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.800]   It's an amazing way to listen to your music and play videos.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:46.440]   It's also great for discovering new music because built into each is Wi-Fi and iTunes.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.320]   You know, Ryan Block must have a stenographer sitting next to him.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.080]   They're actually typing in full quotes here.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.440]   Why don't we get a stenographer?
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   That's what...
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.440]   What were we thinking?
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.160]   Why are we typing this stuff?
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.160]   I know.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.840]   We should have just had someone go in as a stenographer.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.880]   I'm wondering if Genius is kind of their way of responding to subscription.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.840]   He's saying, "You don't even have to select a song.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.240]   It creates mixes for you."
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.760]   You know, that's really not why we want a subscription.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.720]   Say also, "I-R's Technica is live blog."
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   "R's Technica."
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.000]   The cover at live thing is power and R's Technica is really cool.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.400]   We use cover at live for a little while.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   I think it is.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400]   It's really fantastic.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   I love that.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   That's one person doing that too.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.160]   One person taking the pictures, one person doing all the typing.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.200]   By the way, right after, a live chat with you.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   OS 10 reviewer John Syracuse, but you have to be an R's premier subscriber.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   Does that have a date on that?
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   Because I don't think it's right after.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   Next week, he's like, "I don't know."
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   Sorry, John.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   Didn't mean to scare you.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   They're going to have a problem next week.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   Sorry, John.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.240]   No, in fact, if you haven't read John's amazing magnum opus, and we'll talk about it when
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.760]   we do Mac Break Weekly in about an hour, or an hour and a half, on Snow Leopard.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.320]   It's a must read to understand what's going on in Snow Leopard.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.240]   Oh, it's Jackie in the audience.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.480]   Well, Jackie could type fast.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   And take pictures?
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   She's good.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.480]   Jackie Chang is in there.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.000]   Oh, he's trying to stick a...
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   This could be something interesting.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.360]   He says, "Not everybody's computer fits in your pocket."
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.720]   Maybe he's still talking about the iPhone now.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.000]   He seems to be talking about the iPod touch, but they've never positioned it as a computer
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.600]   before, really, have they?
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.600]   Right.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   They said it was just going to be a phone.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.120]   Why are there any applications?
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.400]   And no one should put their iPhone in the back pocket, by the way.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.920]   I've seen the results.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.160]   Well, clearly a Dell Mini is not suited either.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.840]   Yeah, you don't want to sit on your iPhone or your touch.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.680]   I have a picture that shows you why not.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.240]   Not that I didn't, but I have a picture of somebody else's iPhone.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.760]   The glass doesn't handle it very well.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.280]   No, you should see Henry's.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   Ooh.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   It's a ground out.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.120]   Phil's saying it's a great Phil Schiller on stage, by the way.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.880]   You've already seen Steve Jobs and Jeff Robin, the creator of iTunes.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.840]   Phil Schiller is currently presenting.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.400]   It's a great portable game player as well.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.640]   And the PSP and DS came out.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.640]   They seem cool.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.560]   Once you play on the iPod touch, they don't stack up anymore.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:10.120]   Now, they're going after the DS and the PSP, which are really two major game platforms.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.040]   And by the way, at least the DS are much better-seller than the iPod touch.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.520]   So this is what's wrong with the PSP and DS.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.000]   No multi-touch user interface.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.080]   Games are expensive.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.080]   No app store, no iPod.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   Taking stuff.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.880]   Yeah, iPod touch is the Wii of gaming, I think, of portable gaming.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.320]   Now, like the Wii was sold to, like, your mother and your aunt and people who never played
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.320]   games before.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.640]   Well, people who play portable games already have a PSP or a DS, but the people who don't
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.320]   play portable games, they're all playing bejeweled on their iPhone.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   Good point.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.320]   You're right.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.320]   You're absolutely right.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.320]   Or field runners.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.320]   I got it.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.320]   Exactly.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.120]   Listen to you guys always talking about the games you played.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.760]   Do I need you guys on a Nintendo DS?
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   I have a DS.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   It's in the drawer.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.760]   You own everything.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:57.720]   Yeah, but interestingly, no, I bought the PSP when it came out.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.320]   I bought the DS when it came out.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:06.160]   But interestingly, this is taken over even for my kid who has access to both.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.560]   He puts games on his iPhone because it's with you.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.400]   You know, point of access is important.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.200]   Well, the games cost $3 instead of $30 or whatever they cost on the DS, right?
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.920]   Yeah, I mean, a bus 99 for a game.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   That's why I have so many.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.360]   That's a dad's iTunes account.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.880]   You just tap and you get free games.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.000]   So this is the number of titles here.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:36.320]   PSP, 607, DS, 3,680 iPhone OS, which includes a touch in the iPhone over 21,000 titles.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.800]   And as you say, John, they're a lot less expensive.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.920]   Well, that's also not the number of good titles.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.720]   That's the number of titles.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   Number of good titles.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.920]   I would say that's an intro.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.720]   I would say that certainly the iPhone competes with the PSP, not the DS.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.200]   There's some really excellent stuff on the DS.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.320]   And frankly, much deeper games on the DS.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.720]   Yeah, you play for hours and hours in just one game.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.800]   You're exactly right.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.680]   The iPhone is casual gaming.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.080]   But that's a big market.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.800]   In fact, a market that's not really been tapped on portable devices.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.040]   That's the bigger market, unfortunately, for Sony and Microsoft.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:26.760]   Although the new iPhone GS has enough horsepower, and I presume that this is going to be the
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:33.320]   day they announced an iPod Touch that has the same specs to play some much deeper games
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   than it's playing now.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.720]   Well, you need to be able to charge $30 if you have a deeper game.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   You can't.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.520]   No one's going to make a game with 40 hours of gameplay and sell for $5.99.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.520]   I don't know.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.520]   I find that I don't want 40 hours of gameplay.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   I mean, you're a casual gamer.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:51.120]   I just really want to play in the line for 10 minutes while I'm doing something else.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.600]   No, you're exactly that target.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:59.120]   I think that there I've seen now at least one game with in-game purchases.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:05.360]   So that's probably the way you get to deeper gaming is instead is a bug 99 for the game,
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.560]   but you can buy more levels inside the game.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.800]   And I think that that's probably what I've to remember which game it was.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.960]   I think it was a Japanese game.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.360]   Ramp champ has that.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.360]   That was what it was.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   Ramp champ.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.400]   By the way, I'm sorry, it's boring game.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.080]   Have you bought more ramps on that, John?
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   I have not.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   I was a beta tester for it.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.720]   So I kind of got my fill of it before it came out.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   It's based on the, you know, those carnival games where you rolling it like ski ball.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.280]   You're rolling a ball up and hitting stuff.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.680]   And so yeah, flick your finger up.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.680]   Seven balls, 10 or seven balls, 10 or 10 balls.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.560]   You get tickets and even as a little ticket.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560]   It's beautiful.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.560]   It's a beautiful game.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.560]   It's a well done game.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.120]   It's a great example of I bought it.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.320]   I took it off pretty quick.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   It's great.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.960]   It's great example of 3D because the 3D and physics in there is pretty good.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.160]   But that's the first game I saw that allowed you to buy more levels.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.120]   Have you seen, John, any others?
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.760]   I never got past the first one.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.480]   It's the only one that I know of, but I'm not heavy into the iPhone game scene.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.800]   So I'm sure there's more out there.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.520]   Ryan Block is saying, wow, never seen so many dudes get killed in an Apple demo.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.520]   Before.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.240]   When I saw Assassin's Creed go by, I was like, wow.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.640]   That's a great game.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.280]   I mean, no, just on the piece.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.280]   It's a fun game anyway on the PS3.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.080]   I haven't tried it on the iPhone.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:30.080]   But that's an example of a game that is a deep game on the PS3, which probably not quite
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.080]   so deep on the iPhone.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.200]   Well, you're limited by the control schemes, too.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.160]   I mean, you really need a controller and lots of buttons to go into those big, you know,
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   heavy role playing games or whatever.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:46.760]   It does seem like the multi-touch and the accelerometers should be able to give this
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.760]   some good gameplay.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.680]   But it's funny, most of the recent games don't really take advantage that I've seen
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.480]   and don't take advantage of the accelerometer.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.240]   It just turns out to be a little bit like the monkey ball stuff, a little annoying to be
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   too.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.040]   It's not pixel for pixel accurate.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.280]   That's probably the problem.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.280]   So there's just a little bit of.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.000]   And you're tilting and the thing you're looking at.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   You're tilting your screen away from it.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.800]   You're trying to look at it and you're tilting exactly.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   It's no, you know.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.400]   It was an interesting idea, but it didn't really take off.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.520]   It works for those wooden maze games, the little labyrinth things.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.000]   That's the ultimate application of tilt.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:25.080]   Jackie Chang is saying on Ars Technica that Assassin's Creed II will be out holiday season.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.240]   Tapulous has taken the stage.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.800]   Bart Decram, they do the, they do, I think still the number one selling game, at least
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:39.760]   for a long time, the number one selling game on the iPhone, which is Tap Tap Revenge.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.960]   I think I bought it and I played it for like 10 minutes and I was like, I have it somewhere.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.880]   Somewhere buried in these pages.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.240]   Going back to field winners.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.720]   You're such an addict.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   I've been playing a new one.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.880]   Actually, it's, it's quite a good game.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.080]   It's quite a beautiful game called Spider.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.080]   Oh, really?
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.280]   You're a spider and you have to crawl around and spin webs and catch bugs.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.880]   But it's, it's truly gorgeous.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.280]   So it's a really well done game.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.520]   Spider the Secret of Bryce Manor.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.640]   And I finally broke down and bought that last night.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.320]   I've been resisting for so long because, you know, all everyone I know is playing and
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   I said, I don't need another game.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   Don't need another game.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.640]   It's $3 last night in bed.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.640]   It's good.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.640]   Isn't it fun?
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   Good.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.640]   It's good.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   It's not great.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.720]   Another $3 iPhone game, but I mean for $3, you know, if you play it even an hour or
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.080]   two, I've already got my money's worth.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.080]   Money's worth exactly.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.480]   Tapulous founded in 2008 with a specific purpose of creating.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:44.120]   This is Phil Schiller talking games and titles only for the iPhone and iPod touch.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.880]   A real success story.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.680]   They're now working on something new merging together music and racing.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.440]   Interesting.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:57.920]   So Bart Decrim from Tapulous is on stage.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:05.000]   It's called "Ridom Ribbon" or "Ridom Ribbon" with the black eyed peas.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.920]   Now, this is an interesting idea.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.640]   You race down a ribbon and follow the groove.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.040]   Otherwise you lose the music.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:21.320]   So it looks a lot like, you know, guitar hero, but instead of tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, you
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:25.080]   just have to stay on the ribbon.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:31.120]   Sometimes me a little bit of a Sega Genesis Sonic game.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   Your reward is...
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.680]   Do you stay on the ribbon by tilting or do you stay on the ribbon by tap?
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.240]   Those two giant buttons on the top.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.560]   Now, look at those buttons, say, Megamix and Zipper Block Mix.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.320]   So those are music selections.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   Oh, I see.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.120]   It's coming up next.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.120]   So these...
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.800]   So you're actually listening to an album it looks like.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   Here's another way.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.720]   See, that's what they're trying to solve is how do we get the revenue up above a buck,
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.800]   two bucks, three bucks.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.000]   The best way is to get people to buy new stuff within the game.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   And this is...
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   I bet you that's what you do here.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.280]   You buy music inside the game.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.480]   Jackie's reaction, this actually looks like a funny app.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.560]   You're a DJ, your job is to follow the groove or your rich sound will be taken down to basic
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.560]   drum beats.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.200]   Oh, God.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.240]   How horrible.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.640]   I like drum beats.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.200]   This is aimed obviously at the kids, you know.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   That's...
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.800]   That's who ringtones are aimed at.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.760]   I think a lot of these games, you know, I look at how my kids use the iPhone and it's
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.880]   not money to that.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.000]   It's just, you know, click to buy.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.360]   Although I keep trying to beat them up.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   Game Loft coming up, Mark Hickey from Game Loft.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.880]   According to Jackie Chen, who is live blogging for Ars Technica.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.000]   It seems like every Apple announcement has this section now, the part where they bring
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.240]   out the iPhone developers.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.440]   Like Mac developers never got this kind of PR, you know.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.440]   That's a good point.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.520]   20 minutes in the middle of every single presentation.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   They wouldn't bring up.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.960]   You can only even have Microsoft come out, you know.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.360]   You can tell what Apple's trying to build up.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.360]   Right.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.640]   You know, that's the big thing is they're trying to build up the Apple.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.320]   So they brought out, you know, Ebersoft who's going to be, that's a big partner.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.560]   So they're giving them their two pieces.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.640]   They're giving Tap Tap because they made something only for Apple.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.840]   So they played the Apple game there and they did really well.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.360]   So they can talk about we got our million sales in three weeks.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.720]   You know, that's the kind of, so, you know, they're definitely trying to get people excited
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.240]   about making apps.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.720]   The new game from Game Loft is a first person shooter called Nova.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.560]   Game Loft has had 20 million downloads.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.560]   Wow.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.520]   I mean, the wrong business.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.160]   That's kind of stunning.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.400]   That can't be right.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.920]   20 million downloads.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.920]   How hard is it?
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.120]   Pay it one.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.760]   I, I, doesn't say.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.160]   Yeah, it's got to be a lot of free in there.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.440]   It's got to be.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.800]   How hard is it to write a game on the iPhone, John?
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.920]   It seems like it's about the same as writing on any platform.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.000]   It's OpenGL, you know, you're really not using any of the Apple APIs for the GUI.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.560]   So it's no, there's no cocoa touch or anything.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.040]   You really just want to know, how do I get my input and what, what are the limitations
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.440]   of the OpenGL API and then go to town?
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.440]   Is there.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.560]   But again, it's constrained by the budget.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.520]   Oh, you know, yeah, of course.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.520]   Are there sprites?
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.080]   Are there things specifically to help you with, with gameplay as there would be, say, on a
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.080]   console?
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.080]   I don't think so.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.360]   I think I mean, it's OpenGL, yes.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.160]   And, and, you know, the input functions to get the accelerometer and, and to track touches.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   And that's it.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.160]   There's no, you know, sprite library that I know of.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.960]   There's no, what was that called back in the day?
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.120]   Apple had this API for games.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.680]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.400]   I don't remember that.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.000]   So this looks like a lot like Halo as Jackie is pointed out.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.600]   At least it's a Halo like gun.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.040]   Actually in general, it looks like Halo.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.480]   And and I think this is important.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.120]   You can listen to your music while you play the game.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   I wish more games did that.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.880]   It really annoys me when I'm listening to some actually I'd like, I'd like to listen
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.320]   to my books on tape while I'm eating bugs in spider.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   My, uh, game sprockets.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.800]   That's what it was.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   Games sprockets.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   Right.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.680]   Yes, they do have open a L, which is the audio, the 3D positional audio.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.720]   They do provide that in addition to open GL, but in the modern era, there's no games
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   sprockets.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.160]   Have you heard any, any games with 3D audio?
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   I'm sure they're out there.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.640]   I mean, open a L makes it pretty easy to do, but you know, just there's one tiny speaker
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.880]   and then iPod or iPhone.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   People are listening to it.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.040]   Now up Travis boatman from electronic arts.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.960]   That's the same people too all the time.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.640]   It's always, you know, electronic arts always would be soft.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.880]   We can start predicting who the next presenters can.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.120]   Who have we not seen so far?
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.440]   We've seen, you know, we've seen the, we still need like the adorable, independent guy who
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   we've never heard of.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.240]   Like maybe some guy with that, uh, that thing that you whistle into or, you know,
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.400]   Smule, Smule, actually Smule and asked to release a very good game yesterday.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.480]   Have you seen T pain?
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.480]   It's got auto.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   Auto tune.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.480]   It's a great game.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.200]   You could sing into it and it auto tunes your, your singing.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.200]   I'd bring them up.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   Nope.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.440]   Says last up from the devs, E.A.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.880]   They've been a hit on all the other platforms and on the app store as well with three number
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.400]   one hit titles, Madden 10.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.120]   And Jackie's got a, uh, Jackie's got a poll up.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.800]   Says what percentage of the audience would you guess is asleep right now?
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   This is on ours.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   Technica.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:31.320]   Oh, I'd say 26 to 50% would be my phone and the winner is in the poll.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.040]   76 to 99.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.360]   Oh, a harsh ours.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.480]   Technica crowd.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.640]   Should I, should I do an auto?
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.240]   I'll wait until it gets really slow.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   I'll do it.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.640]   It's trying to make this kind of worth our while, you know, to cover it and make it long enough
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   or whatever.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.600]   Everyone just wants to know what are the new iPhones and, and, and, and, and, and, and
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   I bad.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   I mean, that's all we want to know.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   You really could make this 15 minutes long.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:59.200]   Well, I think they want, and I think that this is a chance for them to, to sell the message.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   Yeah, I know.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.960]   And that's, it's not merely to, to fill our time.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.440]   I've ever been very good at chewing food either.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.440]   I noticed.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.440]   I just want this thing.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.520]   The thing is the mainstream media will, will cover it as such though.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.680]   Like that they do this big presentation about developers and then you read all the stories
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.680]   and they do it.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   Free report, you know, iPhone developer this lots of people making money that blah, blah,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.680]   blah, like they report it.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.640]   So it apples motivated to continue to have these boring sections.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.640]   Works.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.920]   They haven't even gotten to the new iPods yet, right?
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.920]   They have not.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.360]   Although the man football does look pretty good.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.360]   You like that?
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.280]   I don't really, I don't think that game is too complicated.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:40.080]   I think, yeah, I think the controllers are going to be a problem on this.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   Look at the screen there.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.520]   You see the little joystick, three buttons, kind of like trying to put buttons on top of
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.200]   the screen that's never satisfying.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:51.640]   And as far as I'm concerned, I think I just like this is, this is too complicated a game.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:58.120]   If it were, if they made it like that football game, remember the old $2, $10 football, standalone
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.040]   football games, that's what we need.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.280]   And draw that.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.680]   Yeah, I think they do.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.680]   Draw the, I think you're going to say the one.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   Go ahead.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.600]   You're going to say the one little man vibrate, you know, the table vibrate.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   Table, that's it.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.600]   Yes.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   Or the, or the thing.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.920]   Yeah, that'd be funny.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.920]   Shake it.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.440]   So the vibrate function of the iPhone would go off and a little man would move.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.440]   There you go.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.440]   Did you have any of your best room?
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.040]   I had one of those football games.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.600]   It was like, it had like little wings on it and you just go up and down.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.560]   You just get, like, you had like three rows and you had blockers coming and then you just
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.600]   had a little up and down, up and down and you just go.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   Yep.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.880]   That's the one Leo was talking about the little, three little lights.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.120]   Yeah, you can only go this way.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.720]   I went like the Stratocaster with, no, something, a matic, Stratomatic.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.280]   I think that was it.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   Wasn't it Stratomatic?
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   I loved it.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.480]   It was actually before my time, but some of my friends had a lot of ice.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.880]   I never, ever took it.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.120]   I never took to my grandparents house because my cousin would monopolize it.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.360]   Unfortunately, nothing's before my time.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.600]   The demos over fills back.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   I hope you agree.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.120]   iPod touch, he says, is not only a great iPod and portable computer, but an unbelievable
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.120]   gaming device.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.320]   No, we don't believe it.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.640]   Which they wouldn't say unbelievable as a superlative.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.800]   Hey, Dane, anything going on out there?
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.840]   Oh, he hung up on me.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.680]   I'm still here.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   Can you hear me?
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.480]   Yes, you're much better.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.160]   Every once in a while, this will happen.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.880]   And I can't quite figure out it doesn't happen to everybody.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:22.480]   It won't happen to Alex, for instance, but it might be that the DSPs, we sent you a
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.480]   DSP 400.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.480]   It might be something with a DSP 400.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   Is that what you're using?
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.760]   I'm using the one you sent.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.200]   I have another one right here.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   If you want me to try it.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   No, no, that's fine.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.400]   Actually, yeah, if it does it again, I'll have you try the other one.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.120]   Because I would love to narrow it down to see if it's the DSP 400.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.200]   That's all we send, unfortunately.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.840]   The person whom you're trying to reach is currently unavailable.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.000]   I guess Dane, I guess we lost Dane.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.640]   Andy said he would text me as soon as he was available.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:56.080]   Meanwhile we're covering live coverage of the Apple announcements in San Francisco today
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.560]   on 9909.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.200]   No subscription.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   Bill says, of course, there's no subscription.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:06.680]   The iPod mini used to sell for $250 when he brought it down to 199 sales doubled.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.120]   We learned something.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.640]   199 is the magic price point in the iPod world.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.160]   We're bringing it down today to 199 for an 8 gig iPod touch.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   This is completely expected.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.560]   And of course, undercuts the Zoom HD immediately.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.040]   Is that with or without a camera?
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.880]   Ah, well, is there.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   I don't know.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   I don't know.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.240]   It's going to be the bad iPod touch, the one without the camera.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:36.120]   This is the one no one wants will be 199, the entry level touch.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:43.080]   We're doing the 8 gig at 199 at 299, doubling the memory to 32 gigs and a 64 gig for 400
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.080]   smackers kids.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.080]   Sign me up.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   Really?
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.320]   I fill my 32 gig iPod touch.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.760]   I'm ready for 64.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   Ready for more.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.400]   And that price point doesn't scare you off, huh?
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.080]   Well, I mean every two years, right?
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.680]   I'll just wait for myself to get tired of this one.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.240]   If it has the GS internals in a camera, it may be harder for me to hold off.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   So that's what they're going to have to do.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.440]   They're going to have to do something more than open GLES version 2.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.080]   That's what you were talking about in terms of the gaming, John.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.640]   Yeah, but it's a smaller embedded version of open GL.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.560]   It's not the full open GL, but it's enough to do games.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   And I don't know.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.320]   Do you know what version 2 might bring us?
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.200]   I'm guessing more programmable shaders or something like that.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:30.480]   It really depends on what the GPU supports and the GPUs and the iPhone is kind of wimpy
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.200]   by comparison to what's in consoles, but it's comparable to what's available in the DS.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.000]   It's certainly wimpy compared to the iPod touch is even wimpy or so.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.360]   If they want to promote this, don't they need to update the iPod touch?
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.320]   Well, the thing is you have all these old iPods and iPhones out there that no game developer
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.400]   is going to want to leave behind.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.800]   So people are still going to be programming for to make sure those runs on an original
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   iPhone are these runs in some way.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.360]   You don't want to cut out that whole audience.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.920]   They're showing an ad right now.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.560]   The funnest iPod ever ad.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.320]   This is a new ad.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.240]   iPod classic lives.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   That's a surprise.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.200]   We were pretty sure they were going to kill that, weren't we?
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   Yeah, Alex.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.200]   I thought so.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.600]   The third move everybody off of it.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.200]   But it is still like if you really need to have your entire library in one place.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.880]   The 160 gigs.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   Maybe it's bigger.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.080]   Maybe it's 250 gigs.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.000]   Why not a terabyte?
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.480]   How much would you need, John Syracuse, to put everything on there?
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.480]   My music collection is small.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.640]   My music collection used to fit on the 20 gig iPod.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.120]   I'm a little bit over that now.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.120]   But the problem is video.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.200]   Once you give me an iPod touch with a video screen, I'll just fill out with video forever.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.200]   Right.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   That's right.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.760]   160 gigs for the classic.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.760]   250.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.080]   250 dollars for 160 gigs.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   That's pretty compelling.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.400]   So storage is what you want.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.400]   That's a good price.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.560]   Well, you know what?
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.520]   What we did is, my wife and I just went through and digitized every CD we had.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.520]   And I used to be a DJ.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.000]   So I had a lot of CDs and she's collected a lot of CDs.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.560]   And it was about 140 gigs of stuff because we did it all at, you know, the shuffle stays.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.520]   The chewing gum shuffle stays.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.960]   Well, the shuffle, I think, expected to stay.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.240]   They kind of have you got to have a tiny one.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.120]   Yeah, but it has no control.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.960]   It's great for work out.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.120]   But I use the shuffle for working out because I can just, I put the mix on that I want to
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.120]   use for my workout.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.280]   And that's all that's there.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.280]   And it sits in the gym.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:25.880]   And there was a lot of speculation that they, because they continued to sell the other, the
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:31.840]   clip shuffle with the controls that maybe they would kill the chewing gum shuffle.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.080]   I don't think they're going to kill it unless it was a total sales done.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.800]   But did they say whether they're still going to sell the old shuffle?
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.240]   Because I'm assuming they are going to continue to sell that one with the button and just keep
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.880]   pushing the prices down until I won with the button is, you know, 20 dollars or something.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.640]   That might be the way to keep this alive.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:53.240]   If they come out at $59 instead of $79, that might keep the chewing gum shuffle alive.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:58.200]   Well, and they really, they really left so little room for anyone else to build anything
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.240]   because they have, you know, they have, they have something at almost every price point.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.360]   The best thing about the chewing gum shuffle is that it sells tons of $30 Apple headphones
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.360]   in the margin.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.480]   The margin on those must be huge because you lose the headphones and they break and you
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.040]   spend $30 on a pair of headphones that cost Apple $5 to make, right?
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.040]   Exactly.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.040]   Exactly right.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:21.120]   Voice over, remote enabled headphones, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.920]   Did you say they make cameras?
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   That's disappointing.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:29.640]   No, and I think that, I think that in fact, it looks like they have not revved the iPod
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.000]   touch unless Steve comes out and says one more thing.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.560]   They have not revved the iPod touch.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:39.000]   They just dropped the prices and added a new 64 gig model, which is this is all done.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.960]   I have to say where we're just, it's barely worth the event.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   That's all I did.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.480]   Everyone's going to be helping for the Beatles to walk out.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.560]   Something because man, this is, I mean, you know, so far the highlight for me has been
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.560]   app reorganization.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.560]   Okay.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   They have colors.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   There you go.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.200]   They get down to $59 now for two gigabytes.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.200]   So that's the compelling price.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:06.560]   $59, two gigabytes and they've got blue, green, pink, red, the rainbow shuffles.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.280]   And still at $59, can you imagine what those probably cost to make with no buttons on them
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.280]   and just the whole button?
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.240]   Top, you know, yeah, it's two gigabytes.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   That's 30, that 33 cents.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   I'm not anywhere there.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.280]   I'm sure the flash is the vast majority of the actual cost of that device.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   A silver special edition.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   Oh, shiny, shiny.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   How about Frouffrou?
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.200]   Steve Jobs is coming back on stage now.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.160]   $99 for the four gigabyte polished.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.640]   See, I'd buy that polished stainless steel.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   I'd okay.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   Okay.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   They got me.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.480]   They got me.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.480]   It's like a Zippo.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.840]   They got me.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.440]   If it lighted cigarettes, I'd buy it.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   I don't even smoke.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.120]   Speaking of smoking, Steve Jobs is very thin looking.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.440]   We do have one more thing and that is a video camera.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.800]   Okay, here's the one more thing, a video camera.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   Where?
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.800]   Yeah, that's the question.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   Is it the touch?
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   Must be.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   They haven't mentioned the nanos yet.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   So it could be on the nanos and the touch.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.600]   We've seen video explode over the last few years.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.960]   Steve Jobs talking nowhere more than on YouTube and where are these streams coming from?
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.120]   People like us.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.120]   Maybe a flip?
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.120]   No, no way.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.800]   It's got to be cameras on a nano and cameras on a touch.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.800]   Got to be.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   All right.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.240]   John Syracuse is calling it and the wheels going round.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.400]   Of course, I also said the jobs would not be on stage today.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   I'm shocked.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.280]   I don't think anybody thought stops.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   Yup.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.520]   So here's a popular one, the Flip Mino.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.520]   The market's exploded.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.520]   We want to get in this.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.480]   We're going to start with eight gigabytes and offer it for free.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   Huh?
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.280]   He's doing a Steve Jobs.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.920]   Yeah, he's doing Steve Jobs.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.840]   Oh, we're going to build a video.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   It's the nano.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.840]   Yep, it's the nano.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.440]   Video camera in the nano.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.840]   Now, that's very interesting.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.840]   Not the touch.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.360]   Got to be in both.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.960]   And does it have to be in both?
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:42.960]   I say so.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:43.960]   There it is.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   Look at that.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.720]   Video camera on the nano.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.520]   That makes it very intriguing.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.080]   You're not going to buy a Flip Mino, are you?
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.080]   How good a camera.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.840]   But on the back of every nano is a video camera and a mic integrated in a speaker as
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   well.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:57.840]   That's interesting.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:58.920]   Does the Flip have a speaker?
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.600]   It's a lot smaller than a Flip.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.440]   Is it a speaker or a microphone?
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   I think it's a microphone.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.120]   It's thick as the Flip.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.320]   He says speaker and a tenth of the volume.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.320]   It says on the back.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.120]   There's a code for being bigger than the current nano.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.720]   I think that's what that means.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   That's Apple Speaker.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.880]   We made it thicker.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.880]   A fifth is thick as the mine.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.880]   Oh, but it's got to be thicker.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:18.880]   I mean, come on.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.040]   They're putting a video camera in here.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.240]   Tenth of volume of other devices.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.920]   Let's see how good the video is.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   What do you predict?
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   480p?
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   320 by 160.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:26.920]   What?
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   It's not going to be better than the iPhone.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   That's for sure.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.640]   It's tiny.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.520]   This is really an intriguing idea.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.280]   640 by 360?
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.280]   You think 640?
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   It's the resolution.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.280]   It doesn't look like a screen.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   I don't know.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.120]   It does look kind of nice.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.680]   480 by 272.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.680]   Somebody's predicting.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   That sounds about right.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.680]   Is it 4-3?
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   Is that a 4-3 picture, Alex?
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.520]   It's hard to tell.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.600]   I think it is a slightly wider.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.600]   It looks a little whiner than 4-3.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:58.400]   It does have strange iPod nano resolution that they've had for years.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.480]   You can watch video on the nano.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.080]   You can sync it back to your computer into iPhoto if you're on a Mac and with one click,
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.720]   you can upload it to YouTube, obviously, from the Mac.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.440]   It has a -- Oh, from your computer, though.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.440]   Yeah, from the Mac.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   That's a little fudge.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.040]   You've got to put a Wi-Fi in there, too.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.200]   Steve Jobs is a lot of rockin'.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.520]   Yeah, I don't think they put Wi-Fi in there.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.800]   There's another picture from Jackie of the camera.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.120]   That's a bummer.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.920]   They say it's the most popular music player in the world.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.040]   They've sold 100 million of these.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.480]   It does have a speaker on it.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.200]   100 million nano sold.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.920]   That puts a lot of video camera into a lot of hands.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.920]   Wow.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.080]   They're not mentioning the touch.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.960]   This might be a little bit of a shock.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.680]   We saw all those cases for the touch with holes for cameras.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.680]   I think they have the stones.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.680]   I think they're going to go, "Oh," and we have the --
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.240]   Coverflow built-in, adding voiceover to the nano, just like the shuffle.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.840]   FM radio, that was a surprise.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.960]   FM radio, that is a real shock.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.440]   They put that off for ages.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.120]   Why would they -- Why would they?
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   I remember this one.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.120]   Yeah, I saw it, too.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.800]   It's hard to believe.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.200]   At a certain point, you run out of things to adding a video camera.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.080]   Start making the nano way more interesting now.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.800]   The nano was just kind of boring.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.640]   But now, this will get people back in stores, I think.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.040]   Pedometer, voice recorder app, works with Nike Plus.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.040]   There's the voice recorder.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.040]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   I'm buying one.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.480]   Well, wouldn't -- Aren't you, Alex?
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.760]   I mean, to have that size device with a video camera?
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.320]   Yes, I'm buying one.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.480]   How about you, John?
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.720]   I'm going to try to resist to hold on to my wife.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.400]   No, my wife knows this exists because she's the iPad buyer.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.400]   She'll buy it.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.040]   My wife doesn't find -- She lost her flip.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:37.200]   So I'm probably going to get one for my wife so that she can take videos of the kids.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.800]   Video camera, larger 2.2-inch display, polished, anodized aluminum, microphone and speaker,
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.680]   voiceover, FM radio.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.560]   So yeah, this is a bigger -- and it comes in awesome colors this year.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.440]   It is a bigger device.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.760]   This is going to be in a lot of stockings, I think, this year.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.920]   This is going to be a very successful product.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.360]   I have to admit, the FM radio looks pretty darn cool.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.120]   I don't care about an FM radio.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.120]   Is it HD?
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.120]   No.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.120]   It's not HD.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.640]   8GB, $149, 16GB, $179 available today.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.720]   Thank you, Jackie Chang.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.720]   She got this.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.720]   So it's $179.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.600]   How would you do that?
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.200]   Why would you buy an 8GB for $149 when you can buy it at $60?
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.320]   $30 before you double the size, of course.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.840]   Everybody buys the 16GB.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.000]   And you can get it now.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   It's like a lot of colors, too.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.680]   I'm waiting for him to say, "Now, of course we had to add this to the..."
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.600]   So we made a cool ad I'd love to show you.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.880]   I don't think they're putting on the touch.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.440]   I think they're only doing it on the Nano, which is a little bit of a shot.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.440]   A couple of surprises.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:42.560]   I think if they want to try to sync up the iPhone and iPod Touch hardware revs, like
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.120]   maybe next year when the new iPhone comes out, the iPod Touch just come out at the same
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.120]   time.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.240]   But, I mean, it seems odd to me.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.200]   You can't leave that iPod Touch there with the old internals for too long, you know?
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:58.680]   Do you think they might have a deal with AT&T or other partners not to make the iPod Touch
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   too compelling?
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.760]   Well, it was faster than the iPhone for ages, right up until the 3GS.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.760]   The iPod Touch second gen was the fastest iPhone OS device you could buy.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:10.080]   It was cheap, it was thin, it was fast.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:14.080]   It would have been a great phone if you could have had a Wi-Fi based Skype on it.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:19.360]   HTML Ray is saying that there were reports that there were problems with the chip in
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.360]   the iPod Touch camera.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.240]   I do remember reading those.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.320]   So maybe that was it.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.360]   Maybe they had planned to talk about it and they ended up pulling it out.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.920]   They could have announced it anyway.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:32.480]   I mean, there must be pretty bad problems that anyone who announced it and say available
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.440]   two months or something.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.080]   The question is, what's the resolution?
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.440]   I don't think they said what the resolution is.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.680]   It's great.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.680]   It's fantastic.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.680]   It's fantastic.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:45.160]   It's extraordinary.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.640]   It's insanely great.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.040]   So he's going through the environmental checklist.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.920]   Man, he looks skinny.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   Great.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.120]   If they were going to do a Beatles announcement, would they have done it now?
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.760]   Or is he going to introduce a band?
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.920]   iTunes 9 available day, a great lineup of iPods again available today.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.360]   That's what we wanted to show you.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.920]   We're really pleased that you came.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.280]   Now we've got great teams of people who work really hard to create these proxies, introducing
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.280]   the teams.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.280]   I think it's over.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.280]   Nor do the same, apparently.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   Oh, that's good.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.280]   Not the Beatles.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.280]   Not the Beatles.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:18.120]   Audience gasps, says Jackie.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.120]   We like you.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   We love music.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   Here's Nora Jones.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.320]   Well, this is interesting.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.120]   The audience is going to start coming out just a little bit.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.560]   Let me see if I get Dane back up here.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.880]   Jackie's got a poll on ours.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.960]   Favorite announcement, new touches, new nanos, new shuffles, iTunes 9.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.600]   They didn't really talk about 3.1, OS 3.1.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.680]   And by far iTunes 9, the winner there.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:44.720]   Not as much interest on the nanos as I might have thought.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.920]   So really the big story here in all the mainstream media is going to be Steve Jobs.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:52.840]   But I think from a tech point of view, the big story is going to be cameras in the nanos.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.480]   I think it'll be good.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   I just really wanted to see.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.920]   I was just so excited about the idea of having them with the eye touch.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.600]   I'm a little let down.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.320]   I'm trying not to cry.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.520]   But a little bit of extra time.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.080]   Maybe they'll put a GPS in there too.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.400]   That would make the touch for me a GPS.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:15.800]   I still have to say that I really am getting to the point where I almost could not have
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.800]   a phone.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:21.680]   Like if the iPod touch did everything that the iPhone did without a phone signal, I'm
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.640]   very close to not needing the phone.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.600]   Dane Golden is at the event.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.840]   He's right out front now.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.560]   People are starting to come out, Dane.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.440]   Some of the presenters are leaving Leo.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.760]   Some of the Apple personnel.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.760]   I see them in black.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.920]   Yeah, the black T-shirts.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.240]   They've heard Nora Jones so many times.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.960]   They're just blazae.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:46.160]   I'm assuming that Steve Jobs is going to be leaving sometime soon by a different exit,
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.160]   I imagine.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.160]   I don't think he'll walk by you.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.800]   But if he does, would you grab him?
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.880]   But don't grab him too hard because he looks kind of good.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   He could get hurt.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.880]   How's that angle, Leo?
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.880]   You like that angle?
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   That's a beautiful shot.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   Are you kidding?
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.920]   Oh, that looks like a high def movie until you stepped in.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.480]   No, you could step in.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   Give me no Q&A.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.800]   Apparently, no Q&A.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.240]   I think with Steve there, I think that that makes sense.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.400]   In fact, Steve didn't spend a lot of time on stage.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.640]   I know maybe a quarter of the total presentation.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.000]   I imagine he's not in all likelihood up to answering questions too.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.360]   That's been kind of a flop for them last couple of presentations.
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.240]   What's been a flop?
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.400]   Answering questions.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.840]   Maybe that's just my impression, but it just seems to me.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:37.160]   The inner day, Apple down to 172 down 0.03%.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.160]   No jump though in the stock.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.600]   There was no worth shaking news.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.600]   No.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.000]   Here are the specs from Apple's site on the new iPod.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.320]   Nano thanks to our chat room.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:54.440]   Height 3.6 inches width, 1.5 inches depth, a quarter of an inch.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:55.440]   So it is thicker.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.440]   Not a lot.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.440]   The bigger one.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.440]   320 by 240.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.440]   Really?
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.440]   That's the display.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   That's the display.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.440]   I'm still looking for video.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:08.600]   H.364 video up to 1.5 megabits a section.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.040]   640 by 480.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.720]   30 frames.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.080]   That's very good.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.800]   That's very good.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.800]   ACLC audio up to 160 kilobits.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.320]   It's very high quality.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   That competes with the flip.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.320]   Does it not?
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.560]   Not the HD, but the regular flip.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.560]   No, definitely.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.360]   640 by 480.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:32.680]   30 frames a second up to 1.5 megabits, which is a pretty good, I mean, I don't know what
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.000]   the camera is capable of, but that's a pretty high.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.440]   But the reason a bit right, yeah.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   Megabit.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.520]   I think the flip still has better video though, because just because of white gathering abilities,
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.120]   like that's a pinhole camera on the back of the Nano.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:47.360]   The flip at least has a pinhole eraser camera.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.800]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:52.840]   What was I thinking?
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.160]   So I'm not sure how big the old Nano was.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.720]   We'll have to just see one of these to tell.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:02.560]   We're going to get Ryan Block on one as soon as he exits.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.800]   Actually he's about to go to an Apple presentation to get a hands on.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:10.480]   So when he does, we'll wait around until he comes out of there.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.560]   I suspect it's going to feel a little bit thicker.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.720]   That's pretty good video.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.720]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.400]   Was that, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   Those are the old specs.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   I apologize.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:21.960]   I take it back.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.640]   Somebody sent me a lick to the old specs.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.200]   That was video playback.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.680]   Sorry, folks.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.160]   That was playback.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.160]   I apologize.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   All right.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.160]   Andy Inako is ready to join us.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.160]   I'm going to call him in.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:39.760]   It's I'm still waiting to see Mr. Chin says 640 by 480 on the new Nano, but we'd like
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:40.760]   to see.
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:48.080]   And apparently the terms of service on the iTunes terms have changed when you sync up.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.520]   You have to agree to the new terms.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.680]   So I'll look carefully to see what those new terms are.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:58.320]   Hey, before we go on, we are giving you live coverage, of course, of the of the Apple
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:04.120]   event in San Francisco with our great commentators, John Syracuse, from ours, Technica, Alex Lindsey
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.040]   from Pixel core.
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.880]   Soon Andy Inako will join us.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.440]   He's in another meeting, but he's going to join us any minute now.
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:17.800]   And of course, Dane Golden on the scene in San Francisco right outside the event.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:22.320]   We'll be talking as the event ends with Ryan Block from GDGT and Brad Stone from the New
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.320]   York Times.
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.400]   So that's all coming up.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:28.400]   But before we do much more, it's time to mention our good friends at audible.com.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.840]   One of the great things about the iPods, whether it's an iPhone, a nano, a touch or
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:37.120]   even a shuffle, they all play audible audio books.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.920]   Now, I know you've got a lot of music on your iPod.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:45.240]   I know you've got a lot of, you know, podcasts on your iPod.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:49.600]   But if you don't have audible books on there, you're missing a great use for an iPod.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.800]   You know, we never have enough time to read, frankly.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   I don't.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:58.200]   And there's always more to read, whether it's nonfiction, you know, history or fiction,
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   science fiction.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.200]   I read a lot of science fiction.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.200]   I love science fiction.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:07.400]   In fact, whenever I've got something painful, a dentist visit or a long transatlantic flight,
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:12.000]   I make sure I stock up with audible.com so that I can be distracted.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   I can enjoy.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   I can listen.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.880]   And when you're listening to a sci-fi novel on audible.com, it's better than a movie because
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:28.640]   your mind is building sets that are far more vivid and gorgeous and incredible than anything.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.880]   Anything any movie director could put together.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.840]   It's the best way to to read audible.com/macbreak.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.360]   If you go there right now, you could sign up for the gold account and your first book
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.120]   is free.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.760]   I think my next book, I don't even know anything about this.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.840]   It's science.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.240]   It's nonfiction.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.360]   I just love the name love and sex with robots.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.600]   The evolution of human robot relationships by David Levy.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.800]   I don't, you know, David's an expert in artificial intelligence.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.000]   Really smart guy.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:09.800]   And the book is all about, well, the fact that as robotics get more sophisticated, you saw
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.840]   AI, Steven Spielberg's AI.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.000]   It's just a matter of time before we start having emotional relationships with our creations.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.400]   In fact, some of you are already doing that.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.600]   Have you named your iPod?
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.720]   Have you named your computer?
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.720]   Maybe you do have an emotional relationship with it.

[01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:03.120]   Now let's get back to our live coverage of the big event Steve Jobs on stage.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.120]   First time since October of 2008, I guess.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.320]   Yeah, since this same iPod event last year.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.280]   Our guest John Syracuse from ours, Technica Andy Inaco coming up soon.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:21.840]   In fact, I think he might be on the line right now from Boston and Alex Lindsay from the
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.840]   Pixel Core.
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:31.640]   Andy Inaco joining us now from an undisclosed location somewhere outside of Boston.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.800]   Hey, it's all about this time.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.720]   Tall circle home, Alex, exciting.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.400]   So Andy, have you been following the announcements or should I recap for you?
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:46.240]   In fact, let me recap anyway so that people who are just joining us can get the word.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.640]   We lost John's camera.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.600]   John, if you want to turn your camera back on.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.440]   The new specs are up.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.200]   So the biggest announcement Andy is, well, twofold.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.320]   There is no iPod Touch with camera.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:08.000]   In fact, the only iPod Touch update is a 64 gigabyte version for 400 bucks.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.680]   The capture now, we do have the other big story is an iPod Nano with a video camera.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.760]   640 by 480, 30 frames a second capture.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.400]   15 real time special effects.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.960]   CPA, black and white X-ray, film grain, thermal, security cam, cyborg, bulge, they must have
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.680]   put a heck of a processor in this thing.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.080]   Colito, motion blur, mirror, light tunnel, dense stretch and twirl.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.760]   So they've added voiceover to the Nano.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:44.680]   They've added a camera to the Nano and looks like a slight increase in size.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:51.440]   Prices $149 for 8 gigabytes, double the memory to 16 and it's $179.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.720]   So this looks like a very compelling product.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:04:03.360]   They kept the little chewing gum shuffle and they announced iTunes 9.0 with some social
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:12.600]   media capabilities and the cocktail album extras that we were expecting.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:18.800]   In fact, extras not just for music but also for video, DVD style extras on the video and
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:25.240]   looks to be and at least in the demo some really good looking album art and lyrics as
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.920]   part of the purchase.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.680]   What else did they announce?
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.680]   I think that's it.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:38.680]   I don't think there was the big new announcements for iTunes 9, a new Nano, updated iPod Touch,
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.160]   no camera on the touch.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.720]   Oh, and did I mention Steve Jobs was there?
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   Perhaps the biggest story of all.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.240]   I think Andy, you predicted that.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:52.320]   I thought that if they're either going to be doing it right now in September or they're
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.320]   going to just wait for another few months for something really, really, really shiny
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.760]   and really, really mirror-like to bring it out for.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:04.320]   I don't think it was as big a deal as it was to anybody else.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.880]   I thought it was cool that he started off with a shout out for Oregon donation, which
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.200]   I think was a very classy thing for them to do.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:19.120]   Yeah, he talked about the mid-20s person who donated his liver and whose liver Steve had.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.600]   Yeah, I think that was classy.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.000]   You're absolutely right.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.880]   I was following the updates through Macworld.com.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.120]   I think I'm sure it was just a transcription thing, but they made it sound almost as though
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.960]   he was saying he was including it as one of the product announcement upgrades for the
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.960]   day that I now have the liver of a 22-year-old.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:46.480]   It did sound like that, didn't it?
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:52.360]   You lose the tone and the flavor by not saying live video, but...
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:58.360]   Any surprises to you, John Siracusa, anything that struck your fancy?
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.720]   I'm very surprised by the...
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.520]   I thought touch it's not having cameras.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.520]   You really thought that that was.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.160]   The rumor got that one wrong completely.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:10.040]   That was the one guarantees thing I thought would be there and it wasn't.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:15.880]   Well, and the nano having a camera is kind of an interesting surprise.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.040]   I think not in hindsight, not a bad move.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:24.480]   It puts them in and really in some ways in a new market, a market that's been very successful.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.840]   This flipped mine out market.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.520]   The codec's got one.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:35.120]   I think one of the things, one of the takeaways from this is that everybody's going to have
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.920]   a video camera in their pocket from now on.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.680]   You better not do anything bad.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.880]   I think that one of the things that you're...
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.760]   Is there kind of going, "Okay, so yeah, sure, you can have the video, but you can also watch
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   movies on it and listen to music."
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:54.640]   So when you're starting to compare, trying to compare apples to apples with this with
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.800]   a flip, one of the big things that you're going to see is that you can do everything you
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.680]   can do with the flip or a lot of the stuff you can do with the flip.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.680]   There's not much to get to get everything that you can do with the flip.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.960]   And then on top of that, you can have it be something that you're doing everything else
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.880]   with as well.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   Another...
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.200]   Maybe surprise, maybe not a surprise, given that the date was 9.9.09.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.960]   I think apple, no beetles.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:18.520]   And I think apple kind of telegraphed it when they chose a rolling stone lyric for their
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520]   announcement.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.200]   I don't think anybody who was expecting any sort of a beetles announcement really has
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.120]   been paying attention for the past, what, six, seven, eight years.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   There's just no reason to expect this happening.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   Again, 9.9.9.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:35.680]   Okay, the synchronicity, but there's too much evidence to say that that just happened to
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:42.160]   be the day that they picked the fact that Labor Day was this week, pushed it one day.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.200]   The fact that it was the same day as the Beals Rock Band release.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.360]   Okay, that's kind of interesting.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:52.680]   But until EMI and Apple and the reigning Beals come to a really big agreement, something that
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:59.040]   is too big to be hidden from the news sites and the papers just don't expect the new.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.200]   And as I've been saying time and time again, it just doesn't make sense for them.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.480]   Free EMI to release all these iTunes tracks the same day when they're trying to get people
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480]   to buy the CDs.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.480]   It just makes no sense.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.240]   Well, it's just disappointing.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.640]   I think a lot of this was just fanboyism saying, I wish they would do this.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:21.200]   And I, you know, I actually broke down this morning and ordered the Beatles box set, the
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:27.680]   stereo box set almost in a way of saying, I think it's not going to happen.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.040]   And I'm hoping it does someone ordered these hoping to be proven wrong.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.920]   But usually you do so well.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.920]   Don't you think?
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:41.120]   I was just going to say, don't you think that like maybe someone in Microsoft's marketing
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.560]   is now working for EMI because now that you can't just buy the CDs.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.400]   It's like, do you want the CDs individually?
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.640]   Do you want the box set?
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.880]   Do you want the mono box set?
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.800]   Do you want the stereo box set?
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.200]   Do you want the stereo mono deluxe box set?
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.360]   It's like, I just want the wide album.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.360]   Rubber Soul?
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.360]   Is it?
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.360]   Robert Soul?
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.760]   The thing that was weird, I almost bought the mono because I really wanted the mono.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.280]   But the mono was like 80 bucks more and you get two fewer albums.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.400]   I couldn't really understand their pricing.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.400]   It seemed very odd.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:16.920]   I think I think the real audio files, you know, they're going to fleece the people who are
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.920]   the most desperate for authentic mono mix of the Beatles.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.000]   That's why I didn't do it because I felt like it was a fleecing.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.520]   It was like such an obvious.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.920]   I just got to tell you, it's only 50 bucks more for it.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.680]   So I'm just going to put the mono, push the mono button on my stereo when I listen to those
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.680]   CDs.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.600]   Oh, it's not the same at all.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   It's not?
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.240]   No, I mean, it's like a black MacBook.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.240]   Remember that?
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.840]   50 bucks for the black color?
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:40.840]   I just painted mine.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.000]   No, I paid the black one.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.200]   I was just saying for 30 bucks more, the leather clicks pop some buzzes on the loss of
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   kick in the nuts.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:53.000]   That's a special super deluxe edition.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   Where are you?
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.240]   You look like you're in a park or somewhere.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.680]   I am in Boston's luxurious public garden.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:03.920]   You see the luxurious swine boats behind me if I can get the eyesight to sort of focus
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.920]   differently.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:05.920]   That's beautiful.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:12.320]   They're duck squirrels that want some of my midday snacks.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:17.800]   I had, believe it or not, I had a briefing on a tablet computer of some flavor earlier
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.040]   today here downtown.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.520]   So I was not able to be at the Andy Naco worldwide headquarters.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.320]   So basically what you're looking at here is I've got the eyesight tripod.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:32.680]   I've got my MIFI streaming this video and I've got my MacBook here.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.400]   And if you see me suddenly like changed to a foreign accent and start saying, "Hello,
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.400]   hello."
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.400]   And daddy is enforcing the "No cameras on tripods" rule.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:46.840]   And I want to say, "Oh, I'm sending this video back to me moment to have."
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.440]   I'm away from the first 20 years.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:53.760]   So the Irish accent is the clue.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.960]   We also have another person in the field.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.520]   Dane Golden is actually at the event now with his trusty eyesight.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.480]   Hi, Dane.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.480]   I'm doing great, Leo.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.480]   We're here.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.680]   The journalist just got out of the event and we're open to have Brad Stone from The New
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.280]   York Times and Ryan Block from GDGT at some point.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.280]   All right.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.280]   So when they come by, just grab them.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.000]   Just the camera on you.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   What are you laughing at?
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.040]   No, no, it just, it's almost like we're a newscast from 1957.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.040]   It's not enough that we have remotes.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.040]   We also have to explain the technology we're using to have the remotes.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.040]   I want to go.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.680]   It's unfurling a banner.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.000]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   WK.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:44.240]   So here's a watch for the turkeys coming from the...
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.240]   Coming from the air.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.400]   Here are the specs.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.840]   The Apple site has been updated now.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.520]   Here are the specs for iPhone 3.1, the software update.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.880]   You get the genius, the genius mixes.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:03.360]   You can download a Buck 29 ringtones wirelessly.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.560]   I think the biggest change is organizing apps in iTunes.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.520]   And actually, let's not downplay that.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.920]   That might be the biggest part of the announcement entirely.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.880]   I mean, that's huge.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:19.080]   I'm almost happier about that than Steve Jobs' new liver because this actually affects my
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.080]   life personally.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080]   That's the headline.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.080]   Better than Steve's new liver, you can now organize apps in iTunes.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.360]   That probably won't make them to my review.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.760]   No, I hope not.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.360]   Improved syncing, it says we don't know what that means.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:37.920]   iTunes U content organization, that's obviously for college students and others who use iTunes
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:44.880]   University.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:13:08.160]   So, let's talk a little bit about the iPhone 3.1, the iPhone 3.1, the iPhone 3.1, the iPhone.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.060]   My iPhone 3G Wi-Fi performance when Bluetooth is turned on.
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:12.920]   That must have been a bug.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.420]   remotely a lock iPhone with a passcode via mobile may, yes.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:21.480]   Use voice control on iPhone 3GS with Bluetooth headsets.
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.340]   Good.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:25.020]   Paste phone numbers into the keypad.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:25.860]   Good.
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.260]   Option to use the home button to turn on accessibility features
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:30.300]   on iPhone 3GS.
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.480]   3GS really has some nice accessibility features.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.300]   Both snow leopard and 3GS really show Apple's interest
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:40.880]   in providing great assistive technology.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:41.860]   They've done a great job.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:45.160]   Warn when visiting fraudulent websites in Safari,
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.500]   improved exchange, calendars, syncing, and invitation
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.380]   handling and fixes issue that can cause some app icons
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.220]   to display incorrectly.
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:54.180]   And I think that a lot of things-- one of the things
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.060]   that they're not really talking about here yet,
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:58.340]   because probably-- I know a lot of developers
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.140]   have been waiting for the augmented reality stuff
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.780]   that we've seen little bits of.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:02.940]   But they said, technically, you're
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:04.700]   not supposed to be doing any of it until you get--
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.940]   until 3.1 came out.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.340]   So interesting.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.300]   Yeah, because Yelp had said that monocle feature,
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.980]   which I thought was pretty cool.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.060]   Not particularly useful, but pretty cool.
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.820]   So I think that we're going to see a lot more of that.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:18.580]   I think that's a pretty exciting area of stuff.
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.940]   And yeah, these are all incremental upgrades.
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:25.260]   I think it underscores the real truth that 3.1
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:27.260]   is designed to do things like turn off tethering
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:31.780]   and plug up some holes more important than anything else.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.300]   I guess I'll start updating right now,
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:36.940]   and I'll have a-- so I can report to you.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.780]   So you didn't need that tethering anyway?
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:41.340]   I didn't need the tethering.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:45.220]   By the way, 3.1 is not a free upgrade for iPod touches.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.300]   It's $5, though, instead of $20 for the last one.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.020]   And I don't know if you upgraded to 3.0 on your touch
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.780]   if you'd have to pay again for 3.1.
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.580]   That would seem a shame.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:58.300]   I guess you would, because otherwise, people would just jump.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.940]   So it must be another upgrade fee that's kind of frustrating.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.460]   It seems like they dissed the iPod touch a little bit here.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.820]   I think that-- I do think that some of the rumors might be--
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.540]   it might be the case that some of the rumors are true,
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:16.220]   that there were some last minute issues,
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.460]   and they might have just cut it off.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:20.020]   Yep, so if you go to your iTunes,
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.460]   in fact, it is available, the download is available.
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.020]   So I'll do that right now and let you know.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.500]   Do you get the impression that this presentation was
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.740]   supposed to have more stuff and more announcements on it?
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.540]   It just seemed like it was missing that Cinderella's palace
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.580]   that's supposed to be at the center of every big Apple
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:38.380]   media event.
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.220]   Well, there was one more thing.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.860]   I don't know.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:45.100]   We've said that before at other presentations,
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.940]   and in fact found out that later, indeed, chunks were ripped out
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.860]   at the last minute.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:50.820]   What would you speculate?
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:54.980]   Would it be the iPhone touch camera that was ripped out?
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:55.900]   Andy?
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.820]   I have no idea.
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:04.100]   There are very few rumor sources that I tend to sort of--
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.740]   I give a lot of credence to.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:09.820]   I think that when you start to see that makers of iPod cases
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.740]   have retooled their cases and prototypes
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:14.540]   that sort of started surfacing very, very close to the event,
[01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.340]   that's when you start to think, gee, there must be a reason
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.340]   why there's this special cutout here.
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.300]   Although it's easy to cut a hole in an existing case
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.860]   and say, hey, look, we've got a scoop.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.140]   But that's usually one of the things that sort of makes me
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.340]   elevated rumor one notch to from where it was before.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.700]   So-- and I am very, very surprised
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.020]   that they would put a camera inside a nano,
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.700]   but not inside the touch.
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.300]   Maybe it's a problem of differentiation
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:37.380]   between the touch and the 3GS.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.740]   iPhone iTunes 9 is available now.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:44.060]   Apparently, people are saying they're downloading it.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:46.220]   Although, as you could imagine, it's
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:48.540]   a little bit slow to get it.
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:49.540]   Let me just check and see.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.340]   Hey, Leo.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.500]   Hey, how you doing, Ryan?
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:52.860]   Yes.
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:53.380]   Good to see you.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:58.100]   Ryan Block joining us now from the show.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.980]   By the way, we were following your typing.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.220]   You and Peter, I guess we're tag teaming it.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.180]   Good job.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:04.700]   Thanks.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.500]   No, I was actually here with Dave, who's somebody else
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:07.620]   have.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:08.660]   He's doing photography for us.
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:11.300]   And we had Peter out in New York helping update some of the links
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.100]   and keeping everything going.
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:15.780]   Well, we followed a number of people, including ours, Technica.
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:19.860]   But GDGT was our primary source and did a good job.
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:20.380]   No, thank you.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:21.100]   Thank you.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:25.380]   Were you surprised by the lack of a camera on the iPod touch?
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.100]   I was, actually.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.740]   I think that was the biggest surprise for me.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.820]   The biggest surprise of everything was that they would introduce the camera on the iPod
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.220]   nano, but not on the touch.
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:37.340]   I mean, this whole event, they spent--I would say a good 40% of it talking about how great
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.500]   the iPod touch is.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:43.340]   And then they introduced the camera on what is--it's still their best-selling model, but it's
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.660]   certainly not as cool as the device that they spent so long talking up.
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:46.980]   Right.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:50.380]   So I don't know if they actually started doing that because they wanted to brace for impact
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:55.100]   when they didn't introduce the camera on that model.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.980]   How about Steve Jobs taking the stage?
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.900]   Was there a shock in the room when he walked on stage?
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:05.660]   I think there was a little bit of an expectation that he would get up on stage.
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.980]   I mean, he's back.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.980]   We all know he's been at work.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:14.540]   So I think the hope was that he was actually going to get up there and prove it.
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:19.500]   It was really kind of heart-wrenching, though, to hear about how his personal recounting of
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:25.740]   getting a liver transplant and his transplant came from a man in his 20s who was killed
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:26.740]   in a car crash.
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:30.820]   I mean, he said all this on stage and it was actually really kind of shocking.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.060]   I wasn't really expecting to hear that kind of thing.
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:38.940]   But I mean, again, it's amazing that he's doing well and that he's able to kind of come
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.860]   out and trot out these new products again.
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:44.140]   Big standing O for him, though, yes.
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:45.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:46.140]   Big time.
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.140]   Big time.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.140]   How long did it go on for?
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.700]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:50.700]   Maybe 30 seconds, Ermin.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.940]   I mean, people love Steven.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.740]   The other thing to remember, though, is even though there are a lot of Apple employees
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:02.060]   in the audience at these events, I don't think that anybody, at least who wasn't with a
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:06.660]   laptop, could resist kind of getting up and giving him a little applause.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:11.060]   I mean, you know, he's between the liver transplant and the cancer that he beat from
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:12.060]   a couple of years ago.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.740]   I mean, man is a survivor of nothing else.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:16.740]   Any other surprises?
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:19.940]   Any other thoughts about what happened there today?
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:23.300]   You know, I was actually a little bit surprised by the FM radio in the iPod.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.060]   No, it just kind of seemed like why now?
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:27.060]   You know, it's 2009.
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:32.060]   I mean, I don't know, maybe HD radio, but it's so kind of late in the game to be bothering
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.060]   with FM.
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.420]   And it's not HD, is it?
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:36.980]   No, it's not HD.
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:37.980]   It's just FM radio.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:42.060]   And again, that is also another feature that didn't make it into the iPod touch.
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:49.140]   And again, I think the lowest model iPod touch, the 8GIG, is not seeing the speed upgrades
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:52.820]   that the 32 and the new 64 are going to see.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:55.620]   So there's a little bit of bifurcation there.
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:57.220]   And yeah, it doesn't have that camera.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.340]   It doesn't have the radio feature.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:00.340]   So I don't know.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.340]   I'm not so sure.
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:07.700]   I mean, these updates seemed a little unimpressive to me.
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:11.380]   On the other hand, I think putting a camera in the Nano puts them really almost into a
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:12.380]   new market.
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.380]   They're in the flip mine.
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:14.380]   Oh, market.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:17.340]   I mean, pardon me.
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:21.500]   I mean, it's kind of hard to really make that case.
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.380]   They didn't talk about whether or not it's HD.
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:24.380]   I'm going to go find out.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:25.380]   It's not.
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:26.380]   I just looked at the specs.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.380]   I know you're going to go over and look at it, but 640 by 40.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:29.380]   Yeah, I haven't seen the pitch.
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:30.380]   Yeah, 640.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:32.380]   I mean, OK, so there you go.
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:33.380]   It's not HD.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:34.380]   It's not autofocus.
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   Well, maybe it is.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.380]   Is it autofocus?
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:37.380]   Doesn't say.
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:38.380]   They didn't mention that it's autofocus.
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:42.820]   I think that they would have mentioned it was autofocus if it was.
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:47.340]   So it's going to be OK camera, but I don't think it's going to be something.
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:52.500]   I mean, look, the Minnow, the Flip HD is-- it makes a lot of sense for people.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:57.620]   You want a cheap camera that you know is going to be good shot and in HD, no less.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:01.180]   I mean, that's always really nice and it's cheap.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:10.820]   I'm going to be a bit-- you're probably not from units and camera component.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:11.820]   We're starting to lose--
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:12.820]   Also, Carrie, I--
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:14.380]   We're starting to lose your signal a little bit.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.380]   Yeah, it's starting to break up.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:21.620]   Can you just shift a little bit to your right because the sun behind you is giving us--
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:25.820]   I want to see your face and I can't because you've got so much behind you.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.300]   Big right here?
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:30.260]   That's your left, the other right.
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.020]   I'll just move me over this one.
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.020]   There you go.
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.500]   Now we can-- now we can see the face.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:38.940]   And in the meanwhile, the connection has cleared up a little bit.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.220]   Just say what you're saying again.
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.300]   You don't think this is going to be a competition for the Minnow.
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:48.540]   You think people will still buy a minnow or maybe the Kodak instead?
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:53.460]   No, because people who are buying those are looking for a cheap camcorder.
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:57.060]   It may peel off a little bit of that market share, but it's not quite the same and the
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.980]   image quality is not going to be quite the same either.
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:05.180]   And the flip guys are just going to continue to build out the camera features on that where
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:10.500]   the camera is kind of an ancillary feature to the iPod at this point.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.740]   So I'm not saying they shouldn't do it.
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:13.820]   It's going to sell units for them.
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:20.100]   It's going to help every bit helps, but it's this kind of incremental updating that there's
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.460]   no revolution here.
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:27.220]   And especially if they're not introducing this feature to all the products in their lineup.
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:28.220]   People are starting.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.300]   People are going to go shortly to get a briefing from Apple.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.580]   People are starting to report into the chatroom as they dissect the specs page on the Apple
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:36.580]   site.
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:39.420]   Apparently the radio has 15 seconds rewind.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.100]   There's so a little bit of a DVR capable.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.100]   Oh, nice.
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:43.100]   A little bit of buffer in there.
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.380]   That's kind of intriguing.
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:46.020]   How about iTunes 9 lastly?
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:47.020]   Any impressions of that?
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:50.820]   Look from what I was seeing of your pictures, it looked pretty good.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:51.820]   It did.
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:56.180]   The LP feature, which is kind of a funny thing to call it.
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:02.420]   It reminds me a lot of DVD extras where they've got these rich menus and you dig in, you get
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:08.020]   clips and features in multimedia that is the actual content itself.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.900]   It's kind of applied to music.
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.900]   I'll just ask for them.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:18.660]   The UI things that they've done in iTunes, nice large images, making browsing, a little
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.500]   bit more zoom-like.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:25.900]   One thing I've always really liked about Zoom is that the Zoom app has a great UI.
[01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:29.020]   I think that they're responding to that a little bit and they're getting away from all
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.700]   the Chicklet album art.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:35.820]   They're going for a much larger in-your-face music process.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.980]   This looks good.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:39.460]   Again, no revolution here though.
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:40.460]   Codename Cocktail.
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:43.340]   They now are calling it Apple LP.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.340]   Apple LP.
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:47.660]   Then for movies and TV, it's called extras.
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:48.660]   Extras.
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:52.580]   It's the same concept except if it's video, it's called extras.
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:58.380]   You did say the Z word, Microsoft's going to release a Zoom HD on the 14th in just less
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.420]   than a week.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.420]   Yes.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:05.900]   Do you think that the apples come up with enough to nip it in the bud?
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:09.020]   I mean, they certainly lowered the prices to the lower price of the Zoom HD.
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.300]   In fact, to beat it by just a few bucks.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:13.540]   Yeah, that lower price is going to make a big difference.
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:17.220]   64 gig players obviously also going to make a big difference because Microsoft is only
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.020]   going up to 32 gigs.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:22.420]   I think if they had added that camera, it would have taken some of the wind out of
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.300]   Microsoft sales on the Zoom HD.
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:27.900]   But as it stands, there wasn't really anything super mind-blowing.
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:31.260]   I mean, nothing happened to the touch that we weren't kind of anticipating.
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.260]   In fact, less.
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.340]   Less happened than we were anticipating.
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:39.220]   Yeah, I don't think that there's anything there that's going to make a potential Zoom
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:41.420]   HD buyer stop in their tracks and say, "Wait, wait, wait."
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:43.100]   I'm not going to go look at the iPod touch again.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.900]   I mean, it really feels very much the same.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:47.620]   So I think for Microsoft, this is actually a pretty good day.
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:51.300]   I don't think they have to worry too much about the Zoom HD getting dinged too hard.
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.300]   But we'll have to see.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:57.140]   I mean, the Zoom HD has its own problems to stand up against.
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.140]   Dodge the bullet.
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:59.140]   Ryan, thank you.
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:00.140]   I know you want to get to your briefing.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.580]   I really appreciate your taking time to come over and saying hi to us.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.580]   Thanks so much.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:05.580]   And great job at GDGT.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:08.500]   A really, really nice job of streaming that.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.500]   Thanks a lot.
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.500]   Take care.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.980]   Ryan Block from GDGT.
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:14.660]   And we're going to talk to Brad Stone from The Times in just a little bit when he comes
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.020]   on over.
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:20.500]   Any thoughts from the panel, John, about what Ryan said?
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.140]   Do you think this is the...
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:24.100]   Do you think Microsoft dodged a bullet today?
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:28.380]   I mean, you were talking before about how you were underwhelmed by the presentation.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:33.380]   I think if they had a camera and the iPod touch and it became more of a theme, like
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:37.380]   now we have video everywhere, video and the iPhone, video and the iPod touch and even video
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:41.140]   in the nano, that would be a much stronger message against the Zoom, you know, to say
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:44.500]   well, the iPod is that device that has a camera all over the place.
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:45.500]   Right.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:49.660]   Now it's kind of odd with that whole nalina up and it's like cameras on the iPhone and
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.780]   it's this big gap, but it's also on the nano.
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.860]   It really weakens their...
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:57.980]   What would have been a pretty comprehensive trouncing of the Microsoft's offerings by having
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:00.380]   the touch remain essentially the same, but cheaper?
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:04.820]   It kind of underscores what we've been saying, which is perhaps they really wanted to do
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:08.700]   a camera and they just couldn't get there.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:13.780]   There was something wrong maybe, maybe the chips weren't working, right?
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:16.780]   You have the feeling that Apple would have really liked to have had a camera for the
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:17.780]   touch at this point.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:19.780]   Do you agree, Andy?
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:20.780]   I'd say so.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:25.020]   You got to do something to freshen the line and new fashion colors just don't got to
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:26.020]   cut it.
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:30.860]   New capacity, that's nice, new prices, that's also nice, but they have to fight the perception
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:33.260]   game as much as anything else.
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:36.100]   And the Zoom HD, that's not bad.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:39.460]   In terms of the quality of the video that can put out, there are other companies that are
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:45.940]   also going to be putting up HD handheld little devices that'll pump out video that's much,
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.740]   much better than what the touch can do.
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:51.340]   They don't have the software library that the touch has, but the question is, is the average
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:53.020]   consumer care?
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:57.700]   So it seems like Apple was doing a lot of just holding their position for this one.
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.740]   There wasn't anything that's going to be really shockingly cool.
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:02.180]   Nothing's going to send people rushing out to the Apple's door.
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:04.540]   I was at the Apple store to buy a cable just two hours ago.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:08.180]   I didn't exactly see anybody know camping out in front of the store.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:10.260]   Good thing too, because it would have felt doubly silly.
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.260]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:14.540]   The download, by the way, on the iPhone 3.
[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.940]   1 is really slow.
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:20.940]   I have another hour to go on it.
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:22.540]   Let's see.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:27.180]   I've got 52 of the 306 megabytes with 55 minutes remaining.
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:31.940]   So obviously, I'm not the only one trying to get it right now.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:32.940]   That's me.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:35.340]   You can be your own damn DJ and save yourself three hours for the download time.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:37.380]   Yeah, really, no kidding.
[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:38.380]   And I tried to get--
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:40.380]   I was just a mix of lots to come to your house next time.
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.380]   Exactly.
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:43.660]   I tried to get iTunes 9, and basically it was rebuffed.
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:45.460]   I said, no, sorry.
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.060]   I'm getting iTunes 9 right now.
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:48.260]   2 megabytes a second.
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:50.180]   2 megabytes a second.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.980]   They just don't like you.
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:52.980]   They love you.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:53.980]   It's me.
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:54.980]   They know that it's me.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:55.980]   Well darn it.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:56.980]   Did you get it through--
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:58.660]   I probably should be downloading it right now while I'm sending video, right?
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:27:59.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:02.540]   Did you get it through software update, John, or--
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:05.540]   I got it from URL that someone posted in the IRC channel.
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:06.540]   Ah.
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:10.060]   Direct link to the Akamai Edge Suite blah, blah, blah URL.
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:11.220]   Now you're a wise man.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.220]   I'm going there right now.
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.900]   I see that URL preparing to download.
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.260]   Oh, you're right.
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:18.860]   Almost two megabytes a second.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.860]   More, 2.2.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:21.860]   Now we're in the front of the line.
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:23.260]   I'm getting it in 30 seconds.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:25.260]   OK, we're going to use that link.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.180]   Whoever put that link up, thank you.
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:28.740]   Thank you, thank you.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.940]   What is that link, Leo?
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:30.460]   It's--
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:31.980]   There's now you're downloading a virus, right?
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:32.700]   Yeah, well--
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:32.700]   It's--
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:33.700]   It's--
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:34.500]   It's really fast.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.100]   It's a fast URL again.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.580]   It's a long URL.
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.180]   It's in the IRC chat room, but it's a very long URL.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:41.620]   50 seconds remaining.
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:46.100]   So slow down on one megabyte as everybody else listening to this show.
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.180]   What was I thinking?
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.700]   John, we have to learn.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.220]   Keep our big notes shut.
[01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.460]   Yeah, now I'm down to three minutes remaining, too.
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:59.940]   It's slowing, girl.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:02.180]   All right, let's-- what I'm going to do is--
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:03.260]   oh, wait a minute.
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.500]   Dain, do you have somebody there for us?
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.820]   Or are you just repositioning?
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:07.940]   Oh, it looks like Brad's there.
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:09.340]   Hey, Brad.
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.340]   How are you doing, Leo?
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.740]   Great to talk to you, Brad Stone from the New York Times.
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:14.700]   The New York Times is here.
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.900]   You were in the room, Brad.
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:17.860]   I was.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:20.420]   What's the mainstream media reaction to this?
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:21.940]   And I know you're not really--
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.580]   you're an enthusiast as much as anybody.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:26.100]   But is the big story for the mainstream press
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.260]   going to be Steve Jobs?
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:28.780]   Yeah, of course.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:30.100]   It already is.
[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:33.980]   Steve returning to at least the public stage five months
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:36.780]   after his liver transplant, almost a year
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:39.580]   since he last addressed an apple crowd.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.300]   And it's good to see him.
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:45.100]   I mean, even as someone who covers apple,
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.780]   he does have an infectious enthusiasm
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:51.380]   and a unique brand of salesmanship, and we saw that today.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.820]   We've only just seen still pictures from the event,
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:57.780]   but he did look even thinner than in October.
[01:29:57.780 --> 01:29:59.420]   I'd say so.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:04.140]   But he was up there, and he ran a good event.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:08.140]   He smiled when he got that great applause from the crowd.
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.140]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.780]   And he's talking about the--
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:14.180]   It looks like Andy's getting roused in here.
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.380]   So we're going to keep talking to Brad while Andy handles
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:18.540]   the police action.
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:20.180]   I was just--
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.020]   I was talking about the medical officer.
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.020]   He's here again.
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:25.020]   I was the very personal commentary about his liver transplant.
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.740]   Because today, we're going to be in the morning
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:27.940]   with the people gathered by the window.
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:30.700]   The victim of a car accident, who had chosen to donate his organs
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:35.060]   and really making a pitch for the public to think about doing
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.020]   the same.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:38.860]   I'd sort of expected, if we did see Steve,
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:40.180]   that it would be all business.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:44.180]   And he definitely showed a little personal perspective.
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.620]   And as Andy said, it showed a little class, too.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.140]   That's a pretty classy thing to do,
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.980]   to acknowledge the guy who gave his life
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:52.020]   and to encourage others to donate organs.
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:53.740]   It's pretty cool.
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:54.220]   Absolutely.
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:57.500]   Now, just I should say that, of course, all of us press folks
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.820]   are clamoring to talk to Steve, and apples are
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:02.860]   restricting the interviews, the after show interviews with him
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:05.100]   to reviewers.
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:08.620]   So folks, I would imagine, like David Pogue at the Times,
[01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:10.180]   Walt Mossberg at the Journal.
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:11.420]   I'm not sure who's in the lineup,
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:15.100]   but they don't want us press hordes asking the personal questions
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:15.860]   about his leave.
[01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:18.180]   So they're definitely trying to restrict access.
[01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:18.900]   Interesting.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.300]   The fact that they're giving access at all
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.620]   is, I think, a little surprising.
[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:25.460]   Usually, Steve goes off and fill in others
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.620]   to take those questions.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:28.380]   So--
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:31.340]   Well, no, back in the payday, he definitely did the after show
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:31.780]   interviews.
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:33.700]   And he was always boisterous and combative.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:36.100]   And they were a lot of--
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:39.340]   So any other surprises for you?
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:43.020]   Did you have expectations going in that weren't met?
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:46.820]   No, I have to say, this is the typical of Apple events recently.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:48.660]   These are events that only Apple can do.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:56.100]   The announcements are interesting, seemingly not huge.
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.980]   But I think the general theme here
[01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:01.100]   is, as Phil Schiller said, with regard to the iPod Touch,
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:03.380]   putting a mobile computer in your pocket.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:06.620]   And it's true even for the new Nano,
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:10.060]   which is getting the voice recorder, the eo camera,
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:10.860]   the FM tuner.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.580]   I mean, all these devices are just
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:16.900]   eating up more and more features of other standalone devices.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:22.260]   And it reaches the epitome with the iPod Touch and the iPhone.
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.020]   And they really are pocket computers now.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:26.620]   And I think that was an opening shot.
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:29.060]   I think we're going to see more of these small portable,
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:31.180]   general, multipurpose devices.
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.980]   And it's going to cause some disruption
[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.420]   in the consumer electronics industry.
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:37.780]   Was there a lot of press there more press than usual,
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:40.420]   more mainstream press than usual?
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:42.620]   No, I think it's absolutely the usual crowd.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:46.180]   You know, every outlet tries to send one or two people.
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:47.180]   Right.
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:49.180]   Brad, thank you so much.
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:49.660]   Oh, surely.
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.420]   I was going to say I love the--
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:54.380]   I love the [INAUDIBLE]
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.860]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:59.060]   And they're staring at their computer,
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:01.580]   updating their live blogs and Twitter streams.
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:05.500]   It's somewhat lost on the crowd, I have to say.
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.260]   Nora Jones is singing, but we've got more important things
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:09.340]   to talk about, right?
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:10.180]   Absolutely.
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.620]   It's literally-- it must be the most awkward gig of our life.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:13.860]   Anyway, thanks for having me.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:15.660]   Thank you, Brad Stone from The New York Times.
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:18.220]   We really appreciate you taking some time to talk to us.
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.500]   Take care, Brad.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:24.620]   Yeah, I think that it's got to be hard playing for that crowd,
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:27.780]   especially if that crowd expected the Beatles.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:31.820]   You know, it's bad enough to be the opening act for the Beatles,
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:33.980]   but to be the act that instead of the Beatles
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:37.780]   is a little bit difficult.
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:39.300]   Let's do a Mac break weekly, if you want.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:40.500]   I don't know if Andy--
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.300]   I heard Andy trying to explain what he was up to,
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:43.260]   and then he disappeared.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:44.900]   So I have a feeling-- we'll call him back
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:48.060]   and see if it was just a technical glitch.
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:52.180]   We still have the shot from Dane of the front of the event
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:55.020]   there at the-- it's a really beautiful venue,
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.260]   the Erbobuina Gardens.
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:58.860]   And that's the Center for Performing Arts,
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:02.860]   which is a smaller auditorium than the Macworld keynote
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:07.420]   auditorium by about a third the size.
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:09.620]   The Macworld keynotes are held at Moscone West
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:12.860]   across the street, and that's a big, big all.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:16.260]   Big enough to get 1,000 or maybe even 2,000 people in there.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.020]   This is just a 350-seat auditorium.
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:22.820]   So I imagine there was some competition for access.
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:24.780]   Johnny, you think it's interesting that Steve Jobs is
[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:27.500]   talking to press at all?
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.300]   Yeah, I think that's a little bit surprising.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.220]   I think everyone thought that he was
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:33.260]   going to sort of fade from the public eye,
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:36.620]   because having him in the public is a liability,
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.780]   in some respects.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:40.500]   The story becomes about him, about his health.
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.340]   If you just keep him behind closed doors,
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:44.300]   then there's less of a story there.
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.060]   I thought he'd be able to stay away, at least
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:47.380]   until a tablet intro, right?
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.780]   Like, he'd let Schiller do the iPods,
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:52.060]   and then when a tablet comes out, there's no way
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.380]   he'd be able to stay off that stage,
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.060]   because this is going to be his new baby, right?
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:56.780]   So he's going to come out there and talk about that.
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:01.660]   But the fact that he came out for the iPods, I guess,
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:03.860]   you know, underestimated his ego.
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:06.740]   He wants to be the guy out there talking about Apple products.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:07.740]   Maybe that's it.
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:12.900]   Is it unusual for him to talk to the press after the event?
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:15.180]   I don't remember him doing that recently.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:17.900]   They sit up on the stools, usually, in that Q&A section.
[01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.780]   The jobs has been up there.
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.140]   He may not answer them.
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:22.660]   They'll address the questions to him,
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.500]   and they'll hand it off to someone else.
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.300]   I think he actually answered the sticker question.
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.580]   Do you remember that from back in the day?
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:32.180]   He was on stage during that, and a couple people answered it.
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:35.980]   But there's only so much I think his handlers can do
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.340]   to keep him off the stage.
[01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:41.540]   I'm not clear if Ryan left and is going to briefings.
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:43.580]   I would guess that there was nobody on stage,
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:47.180]   but these are one-on-one conversations with Steve
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:50.180]   as part of the briefing.
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:52.380]   I'm not sure, but that's what it sounded like to me.
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:56.180]   I don't think these are that on stage Q&A thing,
[01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:57.380]   but I may be wrong.
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:59.780]   And that's been a long time since Steve has sat one-on-one
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:03.180]   with any press, so I can remember.
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.780]   I think you'll probably go into a room
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:06.580]   where the press can ask questions.
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:10.380]   You know, it's not the same venue as the thing, but, you know.
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:11.580]   OK.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:14.580]   Andy, did you get roused at what happened there?
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:16.580]   No, no, just a couple people who were actually
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:18.380]   watching via Twitter.
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.180]   Oh, they found you.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:23.180]   Let's go buy into going on, so.
[01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:24.380]   How aren't you?
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:24.980]   They trained.
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:25.980]   They trained you.
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:30.180]   It's like the Today Show window.
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:30.980]   People are holding up.
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:32.980]   Hey, game, game, 98 years young.
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:34.980]   You know.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:37.980]   Well, you know, I have a feeling that the press
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:41.380]   that Steve will be talking to will not include,
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:44.180]   certainly, was it going to include me?
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:46.380]   And I'm sure it will include people like David Pogue
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:48.180]   and Walt Mossberg, who have been, you know,
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:51.380]   some have said Apple cheerleaders.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:52.980]   But I wonder if you'll take any,
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:54.580]   if you feel any tough questions,
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:57.780]   or if that person will be hustled off,
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:01.380]   never to be heard from again.
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:03.380]   You can now literally say, "Life's too short.
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:04.980]   I need you to speak."
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:07.380]   Yeah, you need to go away now.
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.380]   Thank you for being here.
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.380]   We're not going to talk to you anymore.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:12.380]   Ever.
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:15.780]   It's definitely a situation where if you ask a really
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:18.380]   stupid question of Steve Jobs, don't worry.
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.380]   You'll never have to worry about asking
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.380]   if you'll stop Steve Jobs's stupid question ever again.
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:24.380]   You'll never get another chance.
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:28.380]   Let's bring the intelligence to the conversation up, shall we?
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.380]   He said that, didn't he?
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:31.380]   Yeah, you know, tell us.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:33.380]   Remember that he said that in a meeting when someone asked
[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:35.380]   them how the weather was at the beginning of the meeting.
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:36.380]   Or how was weekend was?
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:37.380]   Like, how was your weekend?
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:39.380]   And he didn't even look at him and just go
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:41.380]   forward and that's not waste my time.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:43.380]   Let's bring the intelligence to the conversation up, shall we?
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:47.380]   So my iTunes download has stalled as everybody from the chat
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:49.380]   room immediately went to that link.
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:55.380]   I have 73 kilobytes a second and 40 megs left,
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:58.380]   10 minutes left, and forget getting 3.1.
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.380]   It's been stalled out.
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:02.380]   It's now 81 minutes before.
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:03.380]   We're all able to get this.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:07.380]   So if you would all please disconnect from the internet right
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:09.380]   now, I think I appreciate that.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.380]   What else can we talk about?
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:14.380]   Is there any other analysis you guys?
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:18.380]   Any other thoughts you guys have after this event?
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:21.380]   John, you've been doing this for a long time.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:23.380]   Anything?
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:26.380]   These are plot events in September have been not very
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:28.380]   exciting for me personally.
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:31.380]   Especially since they're so regular, can you think of any other
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:32.380]   event?
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:35.380]   Even Macworlds were as regular as this because Macworld you never
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:36.380]   knew.
[01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:38.380]   Do it this year, they're going to save it for East Coast back when
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:41.380]   there was East Coast, but September, it's been September.
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:42.380]   New iPods, the end.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:44.380]   Not much excitement there.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:47.380]   This is almost Apple's concession to merchandising.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:50.380]   Christmas is coming back to school season.
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:52.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.380]   Holiday warm up.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.380]   Alex, any final thoughts?
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.380]   I think we're going to see and I touch update sometime in this
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:00.380]   fall, January at the latest.
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:03.380]   I think that they have to, you know, I personally think it was
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:04.380]   technical.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.380]   There must have been some technical issue, some technical reason
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:08.380]   why they didn't want to announce it.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:11.380]   And I think they're going to want to announce it sooner than
[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:12.380]   later.
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:15.380]   Andy, you not go from the field, literally?
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:18.380]   Yeah, I agree a hundred percent with Alex.
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:21.380]   I think we're going to see some sort of an interim release about
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.380]   the iPod touch.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:25.380]   It's too important a product, especially considering that it's
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:28.380]   not only an iPod, but it's also a vector for selling stuff
[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:29.380]   from the App Store.
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:33.380]   And this is a very, very underwhelming sort of refresh.
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:36.380]   It's not what you expect them to release just a few months
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:38.380]   before the holidays.
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:40.380]   So I think that's, we're definitely waiting for the time.
[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:42.380]   There's going to be just a quick announcement.
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:45.380]   No media event, just some phone calls going out and some photos
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:46.380]   going out.
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.380]   There's the brand new iPod touch.
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:49.380]   We did.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:52.380]   We wanted, we were afraid that with all the announcements about
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:55.380]   the Beatles, that people would not understand how awesome the new iPod
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:40:00.380]   was.
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:02.380]   And I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:04.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:06.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:08.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:14.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:16.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:22.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:24.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:26.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:28.380]   I think that's a great thing.
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:30.380]   I'm not sure if it's as much ego, so much at all.
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:33.380]   If I'm the CEO of the company, I normally do these things.
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:34.380]   And now, I'm healthy.
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:36.380]   I want to start resuming doing these things.
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:39.380]   It wasn't an ego thing so much as a sign that things are now back to normal.
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:45.380]   I'm now resuming the full range of my traditional, traditional duties as a CEO.
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:46.380]   And well, we welcome him back.
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:48.380]   We're glad to see him back.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:49.380]   Welcome back to C.
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:51.380]   I hope you did it back.
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:52.380]   It's good of many muffins that I sent.
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:57.380]   So just to recap, Steve Jobs did in fact begin the event in the same event.
[01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:00.380]   In San Francisco at 10 a.m.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:05.380]   There were some new announcements, but nothing particularly earth shattering.
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:10.380]   A new iTunes 9, which we expected featuring something that was codenamed Cocktail,
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:14.380]   but Apple calls Apple LP, which gives lyrics and album, line or art,
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:19.380]   and all sorts of wonderful, beautiful things in the download.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:22.380]   Also extras for movies too, for videos as well.
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:26.380]   DVD style extras called extras in the iTunes 9.0.
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:30.380]   Another really nice feature that we all liked quite a bit in iTunes 9.0 is the
[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:36.380]   ability to rearrange and manage your iPhone and iPod touch applications from the desktop.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:40.380]   So you don't have to spend all that time flicking around with your thumb to get
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:41.380]   everything in order.
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:46.380]   Of course, this happened right after Alex spent many hours doing exactly that.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:49.380]   That's better as we all have.
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:55.380]   I might add that's something we've all spent a lot of time doing.
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:42:01.380]   They showed off some new games for the iPod and the touch and the iPhone from vendors.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:06.380]   Same old bunch, but really pushing the fact that this is a gaming platform.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:13.380]   They did announce support for version two of OpenGL ES, which perhaps makes it an
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:15.380]   even better gaming platform.
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:20.380]   I've heard some people say that they did speed up the iPod touch.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:24.380]   I haven't seen those specs, but they did announce a new iPod touch, a 64 gigabyte
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:30.380]   version, and dropped the prices on all the touches down to $200 for the 16 gigabyte
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:36.380]   version, $300 for the 32 gigabyte version and $400 for the 64 gigabyte version of the
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:37.380]   iPod touch.
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:39.380]   But no cameras for the touch.
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:41.380]   In fact, no other obvious improvements.
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:47.380]   They announced 3.1 software for the iPhone, which will allow this new Apple LP and Apple
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:49.380]   extras capability.
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:50.380]   Also ringtones.
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:53.380]   I know you've been waiting for them at a buck 29.
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:56.380]   Now you can download them directly from the iPhone.
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:58.380]   Oh boy, isn't that great.
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:04.380]   Some more MMS support now that the AT&T and the US will be supporting MMS, including the
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:09.380]   ability to open and save pictures that are MMS to you.
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:13.380]   That was something much needed if you want to use MMS.
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:20.380]   But the big story really was the iPod Nano, which gains a video camera and a speaker.
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.380]   We might add now, we don't know how good that speaker is.
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:24.380]   It doesn't look like it's much bigger.
[01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:27.380]   We'll get a better idea of that after the press have handled the new.
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:31.380]   And then although Engadget already has a first look up, so they must have been the first
[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:33.380]   in the room to hold those things.
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:35.380]   Let's look a little bit thicker.
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:40.380]   But 640 by 480, 30 frame per second video, a microphone and a speaker.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:47.380]   The ability to do voice recording has Nike plus features, a pedometer built in.
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:52.380]   What else is in the new iPod Nano?
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:44:01.380]   Oh, it has the voice commands and the voice playback that the little shuffle has.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:06.380]   So it looks like the Nano is pretty compelling, $149 for 8GB, 16GB, 179.
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:08.380]   Obviously, everybody's going to get that.
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:14.380]   The new Nano comes in many colors as does the old little chewing gum, trident gum sized
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:15.380]   shuffle.
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:16.380]   Did I miss anything?
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:19.380]   I think those were the main announcements.
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:26.380]   A pretty typical iPod roll out, as John Syracuse has said, from Apple.
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:29.380]   But it's good to have Steve Jobs back at the fore.
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:31.380]   John, I want to thank you so much for joining us.
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:32.380]   I really appreciate it.
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:36.380]   I want to point people once again to John's excellent review of Snow Leopard.
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:43.380]   We wanted to get you on last episode to talk me down from my comments on Snow Leopard.
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:45.380]   But I think it's a little too late for that.
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:46.380]   But we do appreciate you joining us.
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.380]   We'll have you back real soon.
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:48.380]   I really like having you on.
[01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:49.380]   Great.
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:50.380]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:55.380]   John will be available for a chat, an online chat, next week on ARS Technica as part of
[01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:58.380]   their new subscription, the ARS Technica Premium version.
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:02.380]   So if you want to talk directly with John, you'll have a chance to do that at ARS Technica.com.
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:06.380]   Alex Lindsay has been talking to us from his darkened room at the Pixelcore.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:07.380]   I like that look.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:09.380]   I know I kind of like it.
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:10.380]   It's good.
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:12.380]   I'm going to head with a microphone.
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:16.380]   And then heads get smaller all the time too.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:18.380]   Thank you for joining us, Alex.
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:19.380]   We really appreciate it.
[01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:24.380]   Don't forget, Pixelcore.tv for the podcasts, including an excellent series.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:30.380]   Everybody agrees from Macbreak, the video version, on the new features in Snow Leopard, particularly
[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:33.380]   Sal Segoya, talking about the new features in the services menu.
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:36.380]   We really had a lot of fun with Sal talking about the new services.
[01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:38.380]   Now everyone, I think, gets why we're so excited about it.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:42.380]   If you check those out on Macbreak video, you'll see what all the hubbub is about.
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:44.380]   Some pretty slick stuff in there.
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:48.380]   And nobody does it better than Sal explaining all that.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:54.380]   And from the Boston Public Gardens, beautiful Boston, Massachusetts, the best scenery yet.
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:56.380]   Thank you.
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:57.380]   Thank you.
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:59.380]   And he's got a few spruels right now.
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:00.380]   He's feeding the squirrels.
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:02.380]   I'm just really holding them off.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:05.380]   I'll see if one can approach the camera for an interview.
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:10.380]   Sir, you have a new video, hit the on-neut shuffle play features on iTunes 9.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:13.380]   Sir, no, we don't use that camera.
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.380]   No.
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:15.380]   Oh, here's come.
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:17.380]   Here you go.
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:22.380]   Andy can be reached at the celestial ways to van with www.cwob.com.
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:25.380]   Of course, he writes for the Chicago Sun times.
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:26.380]   Thanks for being here.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:27.380]   Andy, we really appreciate it.
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:28.380]   It's good.
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:29.380]   This is out here.
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:30.380]   He's out with EVDO.
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:33.380]   And it looks pretty good out there at the Boston Public Gardens.
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:35.380]   A beautiful view and a beautiful day.
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:40.380]   And also thanks to Dane Golden and our guests, Ryan Block and Brad Stone.
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:42.380]   Brad Stone from the New York Times, Ryan Block from GDGT.
[01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:45.380]   Thank you, Dane, for holding down the fort and getting that great shot of the area.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:46.380]   Thanks very much, Leo.
[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:47.380]   It looks like it was actually been--
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:48.380]   It was fun here.
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:52.380]   Better to be outside the event than inside the event, to be honest with you.
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:55.380]   Well, it certainly worked out well for us.
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.380]   All right.
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:57.380]   Thank you, Dane.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:59.380]   It looks like my iTunes download is completed.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:03.380]   I can now install, and I will install version 9.0.
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:08.380]   We'll be back next week with a regular Mac break weekly, including all of our Mac break picks.
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:10.380]   But I do thank you so much for joining us.
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.380]   Don't forget you can download this show.
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:15.380]   We will make it a podcast at iTunes if you want to relive the excitement.
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:17.380]   I don't know if I could take it.
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:21.380]   And we do record every Tuesday normally.
[01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:24.380]   We're recording on a Wednesday today because of this announcement.
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:28.380]   Normally, at Tuesday, at 2 p.m. Eastern, 11 a.m. Pacific at live.twit.tv.
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:29.380]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:32.380]   Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next time on Mac break weekly.
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:42.380]   [MUSIC]
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:52.380]   [MUSIC]
[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:54.960]   (upbeat music)
