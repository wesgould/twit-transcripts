[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.000]   And we have a big cast of crew and a really accomplished cast
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.280]   of crew joining us.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.040]   In studio today, of course, the usual suspect, Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.520]   I've been upgraded to accomplished.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.200]   I'm pretty excited.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.320]   He's accomplished.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.360]   I don't know what he's accomplished.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.840]   He's from pixelcore.com at pixelcore.tv
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.800]   if you want to follow the podcast.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.600]   And you brought somebody into studio with us.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.080]   Do you want to introduce Aaron?
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.600]   Aaron Hillagas, who is teaching at--
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   so we have a pixel core class going on right now in San Francisco,
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.080]   actually just next to the pixel core offices.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.120]   We got so big that we had to move it out of the pixel core
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.600]   because we couldn't keep everybody in.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.120]   So big!
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.600]   We get so big!
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.520]   We just had a huge response when we announced it.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.000]   And so we're having this class next to the pixel core offices
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.280]   on beginning iPhone programming.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.880]   And it is just--
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.160]   I've been wanting to take a class from Big Nerd Ranch for years now.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.560]   And we've wanted to have you in class.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.800]   I know, yeah, exactly.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.600]   And it's been one of those things that I just--
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.640]   getting my schedule is so crazy being able to get out.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.800]   And even now, it's difficult.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.320]   But I'm making it happen.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.960]   And--
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.040]   You know, it's funny because I've--
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.080]   Because I've wanted to take one of these.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.400]   I bought Aaron's book in 2001 on OS 10 Coco.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.480]   Actually, I think one of the first books on Coco in a great book.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.680]   You were an open step or next step developer.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.180]   That's right.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.520]   I was at Next.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.920]   And I did a lot of training there.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.160]   And I ended up going off and doing a dot com thing.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.040]   But then Apple actually had me come and teach their engineers
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.840]   how to do open step development.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.280]   They named it Coco.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.520]   But I got to see OS 10.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.920]   And that's when I really decided that there
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   should be a good book on it.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.800]   It's still a classic.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.640]   Although you're in your third edition now.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.080]   That's right.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.760]   It doesn't look anything like that.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.400]   This was white.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.840]   It's sold.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's now brown.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.680]   And I've asked it free paper.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.360]   No, actually, it is.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.120]   The paper is still white.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.160]   And this was a very clear, easy to understand.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.680]   And I love the introduction where
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.800]   you talk about learning the program.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.160]   Had you started Big Nerd Ranch when you--
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.800]   I think you had.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.320]   We had.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.640]   So what we've always done is we teach our materials as a class
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.880]   first so we can test it out and really work out
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.920]   all the kinks.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.640]   And then we can put it together as a book.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.320]   And as a result, we look extra smart.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.680]   But really, it's just trial and error.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.000]   As if that were--
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.040]   I mean, if weren't enough, I've got to have to have a hair
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.000]   and hilly gas.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.400]   And Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.120]   And, of course, let's not forget Andy and not
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.160]   co-speaking of the usual subjects from the suspects
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.320]   from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.440]   Hello, Andy.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.320]   We are very suspect of the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   Thank you.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.320]   But I'm thrilled to--
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.360]   Well, we're accounting practice.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.560]   For the first time ever on this show,
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.480]   a guy I've been following for years--
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.240]   first at Wired with the Cult of Mac column
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   and now with his own website, CultofMac.com--
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.120]   Leander Kaney.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.720]   It's so great to talk to you.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.380]   Great.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.880]   Thank you.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.400]   Thanks for having me.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.200]   Thanks for being here.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.040]   Leander, now you may notice, if those of you watching
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.640]   on video on audio, you probably won't notice the thing.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.440]   But on video, Leander seems to be holding
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.720]   a Western electric handset.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.480]   It looks like you're on hold with Pan Am trying
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   to make a 7-2-1 sound of a simulation by doing this.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.760]   My mad, mad moment.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.200]   But it sounds great.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.800]   I just hope your arm doesn't get tired, Leander.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.200]   If you want to put it down at any point, please, you know--
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.560]   Oh, I'll just hook it on my shoulder.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.100]   There you go.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.400]   We used to do that for years.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.120]   We'd do that, right?
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.240]   That's how we did it.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.960]   Leander wrote a great book called Cult of Mac.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.800]   You remember it.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.600]   They had featured the guy with the shaved head
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.160]   and the apple on the back.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.640]   It's been following a Macintosh for a long time.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.480]   Are you in the UK or are you here in the States?
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.240]   San Francisco.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.960]   OK.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.440]   I shouldn't--
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.480]   I'm originally from London.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.800]   Yeah, I recognize the accent.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.480]   But a lot of times, it's people from San Francisco
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.160]   who have the most Skype lag.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.360]   If we're talking to London, usually it's really good.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.880]   It's look at his plate.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.080]   That's a very strange thing.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.000]   It's good to have you, Leander.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.800]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.880]   OK, my pleasure.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.560]   Weekly.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.160]   So I have one in my hot little hands.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.840]   I think everybody's got one except Alex Lindsey.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.680]   I'm not going to cry.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.480]   I ordered it that day.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.280]   And I had a BTO, so I got a 4-gig.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.720]   This is the 11-inch MacBook Air.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.040]   It's awesome.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.560]   And you know what?
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.080]   It is awesome.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.280]   I have to say, I'm impressed.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.120]   Andy, you've had it probably longer than anybody.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.560]   I--
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.840]   I mean, isn't the 11-inch just really the whole reason
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.520]   why you want to get a MacBook Air?
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.240]   I mean, that might be a question.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.480]   Like, as I was trying to write about it,
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.880]   was that why would you necessarily
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.760]   want to buy the 13-inch when the 11
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.760]   is so much smaller, so much lighter?
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.960]   You do give up one SD card slot and a little bit
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.760]   of processing power, but it's not as though this is going
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.160]   to be a render man tighten anyway.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.240]   So I like it a lot.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.200]   I wish the battery would last longer, but--
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.600]   That might be one reason to buy the bigger one
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.680]   as you get a seven hours instead of five hours
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.080]   or something like that, right?
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   Five hours still seems like an eternity to me.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.760]   Five is good.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.360]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.880]   Now, Aaron, you've been--
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.680]   you have one.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.880]   Have you been programming on one?
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.240]   I mean, are you actually running software?
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.400]   It is still relatively new, but I have been playing with it.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.520]   And I've actually been surprised at how great the performance is,
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.960]   especially anything that involves the hard drive, which,
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.800]   as you know, it's not really a hard drive anymore.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.680]   It's flash memory.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.960]   Applications launch so quickly.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.360]   One bounce.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.160]   One bounce.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.800]   And you know, I put a Corsair into my 15-inch MacBook--
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.080]   we should say this right away.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.880]   I put a Corsair to my 15-inch MacBook Pro
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.520]   about six months ago.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.320]   And same thing.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.800]   It's the solid state.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.160]   There's no magic in the air.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.280]   It's just a solid state drive on any MacBook
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.480]   that makes a big difference.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   I mean, even the underpowered 11-inch model
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.880]   runs Photoshop perfectly fine, I'm sure,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.960]   just because it uses so much disk space for virtual memory.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.200]   And since that's all SSD, it'll make up
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.440]   for a lot of the deficiencies of the processor.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.720]   Well, and also, I think people underestimate
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.200]   how important disk speed is to the overall performance
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.680]   of a computer.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.480]   A lot of the stuff you do, including--
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.160]   and Aaron brought this up, including programming,
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.880]   is diskbound.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.400]   Sure point.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.920]   Getting all the source code files in and out compiled.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.840]   So speeding that up is going to be--
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.000]   the answer you said you have two of these?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.160]   Yeah, yeah, I got the 13-inch today,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.240]   and I reviewed the 11-inch over the weekend.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.520]   So what do you think?
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.240]   Should people look at the 13 at all?
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.280]   Yeah, just for the bigger screen size of nothing else,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.720]   plus the SD card slot.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.000]   This is a replacement, I think, for the 13 and the 15-inch MacBook
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.240]   Pro.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.400]   These machines, I don't think--
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.240]   Actually, I was going to want to replace
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.360]   the regular MacBook Pro line.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.960]   So if you--
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.400]   I don't think people are saying--
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.360]   Instead of buying an iPad, you might buy the 11-inch.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.160]   Instead of buying a 13-inch MacBook Pro,
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.120]   you'd buy the 13-inch MacBook Air.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.000]   You don't think so, Andy?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.200]   I think it's a great machine.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.480]   It's a great second computer, but it really
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.920]   can't do what you can do with a traditional 13-inch or 15-inch
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.560]   MacBook.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.840]   I mean, my main computer is a 15-inch MacBook.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.200]   I rarely even fire up my desktop anymore.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.760]   And I really don't even think that the 13-inch could handle--
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.520]   I don't think I'd be very happy with it.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.520]   If it were my main-ax day-to-day computer
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.240]   where I had the expectation where, no matter what situation
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.000]   I find myself in, I'm going to want
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.600]   to make sure that I can find a solution in this machine.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.320]   If I were traveling with the Air,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.640]   it's sort of like that I actually
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.040]   talked about this in my Sun Times review,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.640]   where I've been using my iPad as my travel computer.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.840]   If I'm going to be out of the house for two or three days,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.520]   then it'll cover everything that I needed to do.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.000]   But there are always going to be those things where, oh, man,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.120]   this would be so easy if I could just print from this thing.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.720]   This would be so easy if I could attach an external DVD
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.160]   or any of these other things.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.800]   I really think that if I were to rely on a MacBook Air
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.320]   as my main-- to do the work of a regular MacBook Pro
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.160]   or even a plain MacBook, there'd be performance where I'm like,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.400]   why am I carrying so much extra crap with me everywhere
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.000]   I go just to get basic features that I really
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.720]   need like several times a week?
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.760]   I think for me-- I think that's a mistake.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.320]   I think it would be closer for me if they were supporting USB
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.680]   3.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.080]   The USB 2, for what we do, I need the Firewire 800 still
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   on my 13-inch.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.720]   Why is Apple not doing USB 3?
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.840]   Aaron, I have no wisdom in that.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.320]   The word is that the spec isn't completely finalized,
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.640]   although a lot--
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.040]   I see manufacturers are doing that.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.200]   Are going down that path.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.760]   You already have a lot of hardware manufacturers
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.680]   already going down that path.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.320]   I don't know whether Apple's sandbagging it for some reason
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.720]   or they just don't want to commit.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.160]   It's really frustrating because there
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.080]   are so many peripherals from a professional standpoint
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.880]   that use USB 3 now.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.600]   A lot of Blackmagic interface stuff is all using that.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.240]   And it's just a lot faster.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.920]   And I wouldn't need the Firewire, to be honest, a lot of the time
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.960]   if I had USB 3.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.800]   But as it is, USB 2 is not sufficient from a professional's
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.480]   perspective to turn over.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.520]   If that was the case, to me, getting rid of the 13-inch pro
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:11.960]   would be great.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.480]   I'd love to see Apple back up a little.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.000]   I know they won't do this.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.960]   What's really missing out of the 15-inch is the Expresslot.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.320]   It's a higher-end professional.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.720]   Pushing us to the 17-inch really makes me angry every time
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   I buy another 17-inch because we buy 17-inches.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.920]   And the only thing we buy them for is the Expresslot.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.760]   Leander, do you have any insight as to USB 3
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.640]   or why Apple might not be doing that yet?
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.000]   Sorry, I don't.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.040]   I don't have a clue what's going on with the USB 3.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.120]   I haven't followed it at all.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.680]   I'd imagine that--
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.920]   It's a kind of thing PC people follow because PC people
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.800]   are getting it.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.480]   Lightpeak, we were very excited about lightpeak for a while.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.280]   And now I'm wondering if lightpeak is dead.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.120]   Maybe Apple's kind of stuck in between.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.800]   They've started phasing out Firewire now.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.560]   They're bringing it back.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.000]   What were you saying there?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.160]   Yeah, Apple has always made sure that there's
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.840]   some differential between--
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.160]   Well, I have to do that, right?
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.400]   --the MacBook versus MacBook Pro.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.960]   And for a while, it was the external display port.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.160]   And now everything's got external displays.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.520]   So they still need to have something where they can force
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.440]   Alex to buy 17-inch computers.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.240]   Yeah, it's all about Alex, frankly.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.880]   Exactly.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.160]   It's all a conspiracy.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.080]   I think it was John Gruber and Daring Fireball that said,
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.760]   there is-- normally, Apple has a very clear kind of stair
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.640]   step of--
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.960]   you know exactly what product to get.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.000]   And this is-- this air has muddied the product line.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.960]   I think the real thing that's in danger is the MacBook.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.080]   I mean, the MacBook Pros, there's still some things that
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.560]   make sense.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.560]   I don't think the MacBook--
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.560]   I don't think the MacBook--
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.360]   Yeah, well, that's what he says.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.080]   Well, there's $2,000 computers.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.160]   The MacBook's gone.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.000]   I think it's--
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.520]   I think it's--
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.080]   You disagree, Andy?
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.240]   No, totally disagree.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.520]   Because anybody who--
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.200]   people like us, it's a tough decision between the MacBook.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.520]   The MacBook Air is going to be very, very desirable.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.560]   But when you're talking about the person who just wants
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.640]   a useful notebook, they're going to ask,
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.760]   where's the DVD slot?
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.040]   They're going to ask, how come we can't plug into this really
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.960]   good Verizon file so that I'm getting?
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.360]   How come I got this small screen?
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.160]   How come I-- the battery doesn't last 10 hours?
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.880]   All these questions that are answered by even the $999 MacBook
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.760]   that are not answered by $1,400 MacBook Air.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.960]   Web9909 in our chatroom says a MacBook
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.400]   can be used as your one computer, but an Air X9.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.200]   Exactly.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.700]   Right.
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.040]   That's the point you've been making.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.120]   I think a lot of the schools--
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.760]   I know my kids school buy the white plastic MacBook,
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.960]   because that's kind of the perfect school computer.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.400]   Also, I think a little bit more durable.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.440]   I do think--
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.440]   But that's exactly why.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.520]   The unibodies, I think, are fragile.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.120]   I mean, they're much more fragile than the old ones.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.520]   You've got to admit, this is very attractive.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.320]   So light, so thin.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.360]   I think this 11-inch is going to be a big seller for Apple.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.720]   I have to think.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.280]   You really sell it the first time that you're
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.600]   at a Panera bread or something using the free Wi-Fi.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.880]   And the first time you're done, you just
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.360]   go like this, toss in your bag and leave without clothes.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.280]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:56.920]   Has it parked?
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.520]   Are you parked?
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.480]   Are you parked?
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.640]   You're kind of lifting out?
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.320]   I don't lift you now.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.120]   OK, you OK?
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.000]   The drives are bent, and then you pick it up and go.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   All I know is that I've gotten at least
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.840]   one extra free beverage refill per visit to Panera,
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.600]   because I can easily just grab this,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.400]   take it back to the Spencer, fill up my cup,
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:12.960]   and go back.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.960]   That's true.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.480]   That's true.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.160]   You just pick it up.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.240]   I'm just going to put it.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.960]   Now, I understand the TSA, airport security, says,
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.800]   you're not going to have to take this out of your bag.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.200]   This isn't-- I don't know--
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.360]   But it's almost a backhanded conflict,
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.560]   because you're just like, oh, well,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.480]   that's because of the importance of the recognition
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.480]   of Apple that they make.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.080]   No, it's not really a computer.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.960]   They think it's a netbook.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.680]   Oh, it's a toy.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.960]   It's the idea that it's so small,
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.360]   you couldn't put enough C4 in it to make it explosive.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.520]   I think it's the hard drive.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.640]   I think the hard drive is actually
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.360]   one of the things that they need separated from.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.280]   Because they can't see three.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   I get a lot of attention.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.880]   They take-- when I carry a lot of hard drives,
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.800]   which I do, oftentimes through airport,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.560]   that's the thing that's going to get my bag opened up.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.560]   Or big lithium ion battery packs,
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.640]   because those are explosive.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.920]   I mean, they really are dangerous.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.360]   The big deal is that when you screen this,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.600]   when we put this to the machine,
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   everything is pretty much laid out on one little tray.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.880]   It's not like multiple layers of multiple electronics
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.040]   and multiple mechanical devices.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.760]   So it's easy for them to separate those
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.200]   from all the other things in your bag.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.880]   Now, some airports, they may ask you to take it out.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.560]   They do it-- I'm being told by the chat room.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.760]   Cameron38 says the LAX requires you to take netbooks out
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.960]   of your--
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.160]   And iPads.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   And iPads.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.960]   Take my iPad out.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.920]   I'm frequently not asked to take my iPad out.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.600]   Barely ever.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.120]   Barely ever.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.000]   But LAX, they do.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.880]   So it's up to the discretion of the--
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.760]   How is it always of the minions at the airport?
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.240]   So I'm thinking this is a great computer for traveling.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.440]   I mean, I could almost use this instead of the iPad.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.520]   I think we always have to separate ourselves
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.160]   as geeks from the general population
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.880]   that Apple is building hardware for,
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.720]   is that when I look at how my parents kids--
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.280]   I'm not saying that's--
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.320]   Go ahead, Leander.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.280]   I think for the general consumer,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.240]   this is a replacement machine.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:14:59.880]   I think--
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.380]   No.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.280]   That's the interesting thing.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   You have a different--
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.480]   This could be my compute for a huge, huge section
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.560]   of Apple's customer place.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.920]   I mean, I look at my daughter's usage of her MacBook.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.320]   That's why I thought that the MacBook's dead,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.240]   is I look at her the way she uses it.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.440]   And this little 11-inch would have been perfect for her.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:15.940]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.120]   In fact, it's getting close to the meaning of the rabbit.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.280]   So I hope she's not listening.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.800]   Now, you don't think that for so many people,
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.040]   a big disconnect is going to be that simple metric that,
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.320]   for $1,000, I can either get a laptop with a 256 gigabyte
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.800]   hard drive, or I can get one with a 64 gigabyte hard drive.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.640]   Or I can go Windows and get a half terabyte of storage
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.040]   if they save them out of money.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.200]   I think that's one of the biggest things
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.920]   that people look at when they're normal people
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.000]   trying to buy laptops.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.520]   I think it all comes down to how they manage their media.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.640]   I mean, I think that's the big thing,
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.560]   is are they streaming the media, or are they downloading it?
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   Is it somewhere external?
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.160]   This is a cloud computer, isn't it?
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.840]   Is this going to sell more--
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.800]   It's going to sell more dot me accounts, mobile me accounts?
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.160]   It is.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.880]   It's kind of made for mobile.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.680]   It's going to sell more Netflix accounts.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.280]   Did you see-- I mean, this is off topic--
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.080]   but did you see that Netflix, according to one report
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.120]   from Sandvine, which I think monitors a lot of internet traffic,
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.040]   20% of all peak prime time viewing--
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.240]   Tweet 8 and 10 PM.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.320]   Tweet 8 and 10 PM.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.280]   20% is Netflix streaming movies and TV.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.840]   21 and 5?
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.360]   And there's a picture right next to that of someone
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.880]   at Warner Brothers going, no.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.320]   That's the end of the DVD.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.880]   And I think that that's part of the issue here,
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.760]   is that we are getting to the end of plastic.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.160]   I mean, this thing is shipping with a tiny little USB key.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.660]   I know.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.600]   I think that's amazing.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.800]   I'm so glad to be going.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.080]   I mean, I hate plastic.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.200]   That's the thing right here.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.120]   Yeah, I got one too.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.240]   Just insulted by plastic.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.720]   I'll cover Aaron with it.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.880]   It's so small.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.560]   Aaron's head is covered with it.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.240]   Isn't that a mess?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.760]   I'm flashing your head.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.360]   I'm flashing your head.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.080]   This is the first time Apple's done this,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   although Apple could have done this for a long time.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.200]   I guess Apple said--
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.680]   didn't Steve Jobs say that they are the number one
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.800]   consumer of flash memory in the world?
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.520]   Yep.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.680]   Flash memory, not flash adobe.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.440]   Right.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.400]   Yes.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.640]   I do like the fact that the emergency
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.480]   does this package with the air.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.760]   It's packaged inside this little bubble here
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.720]   so that you get that full effect of, in case of emergency,
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.680]   break plastic.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.680]   Right.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.360]   Where's the little hammer?
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.640]   I'm going to put mine back in because this thing is so small,
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.120]   I could easily lose it.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.400]   I think also need to think about this
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.240]   as compared to the iPad.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.600]   And when I think about the iPad,
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.160]   it's sort of a more intimate device.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.960]   You hold it on your lap.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.400]   You can watch movie and read books.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   And you struggle.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.680]   It's not cuddly.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.240]   You can't see that.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.240]   Exactly.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.920]   I wouldn't want to be-- if I were
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.960]   trying to entertain myself over four hour flight,
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.560]   I'm not sure that I would-- if I had this choice between an iPad,
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.760]   then I can hold like a book and put an angle or have the MacBook
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.200]   Air, where I have to still kind of hold it and manage it,
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.640]   where it's great for things that are very easel-like,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.160]   but not good for anything else.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.120]   I'm not sure if I go that route.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.000]   I find myself on flights now in this weird experience
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.880]   where I'm a little bit of time on my iPhone,
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.040]   then I open up my iPad, and then I open up my laptop,
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.280]   and then I go back to my iPad.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   And there's like different--
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.200]   I'm very mobile now.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.480]   It's like I'm constantly moving around.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.040]   You give me a flight longer than four hours,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.880]   and I will have used all of them for an hour.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.360]   I tell you, I was so self-conscious
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.200]   because my first day with the air,
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.000]   because I've got it out for its first spin
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.160]   and I'm at a pizza place.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.400]   But I also like all my books were my iPads.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.080]   My iPad next to it, and my phone is my iPhone.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.400]   And I suddenly look at all these Apple logos around me
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.000]   and I figure that this is exactly the epitome
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.320]   of everything that people hate about people
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   who like Apple products.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.120]   This is why people hate those.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.600]   I should have my iPad, iPad, and Nano
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.640]   like clipped my shoulder just to be a total D of us.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.480]   Well, you know what?
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.160]   When we were shooting in Phoenix--
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.160]   I was watching.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.320]   We were shooting in Phoenix last week,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.240]   and I really heard about the whole Halo effect.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.000]   There were two or three people that we were talking to
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.800]   who were typically PC users.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.640]   They bought their iPhone.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.280]   They love their iPhone so much that when they came up
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:54.800]   to upgrade.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.280]   And I just thought that that was a little silly.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.560]   Like, do they really buy their computer based on their phone?
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.960]   And it turns out that that experience is so good.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.560]   You know, they buy that iPhone or the iPad,
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.400]   and it really is making a massive difference
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.680]   in Mac adoption, at least among a certain, you know,
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.840]   cross-section.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.960]   No, I think that's universal.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.160]   I'm going into huge companies now.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.000]   I think it's pretty widespread.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.800]   That's a huge iPad, eh, effect.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.400]   I'm going to use huge corporations that three years ago
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.600]   would have never had a Mac.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.560]   And I'm seeing Macs on people's desks.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.800]   And that's how it all happened.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.160]   Is the call to Mac Leander, you've been watching it
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.000]   and covering it.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.360]   Is it stronger now than it ever was?
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.080]   It's, it's not the call to Mac anymore.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.680]   It's the call to Apple, the call to iPhone,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.440]   the call to the iPod Touch.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.680]   It's a much broader church.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.240]   But, you know, talking earlier about the, the Halo Effect,
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.000]   I mean, people, I used to work with this guy.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.280]   He was a real Apple hater.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.080]   He used to make fun of me.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.600]   Hey, Mr. Coler Mac, are you doing today?
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.200]   You know, and he got an iPhone.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.760]   And the next thing you know, he's got an iMac, an iPad.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.760]   Another iPhone.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.760]   He's got an iPod Touch just for his kids.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.960]   And then, and he was the most zealous, you know,
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.560]   convert that you could, that you could run into.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   You know, he was, he was really, really, um,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.120]   culted.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.920]   Well, I'll tell you the same things with right here in the,
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.800]   in the Twi, college.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.520]   Lisa, our CEO who does all, you know,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.480]   is our also does all our finances and stuff.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.920]   And of course, uses Excel and uses,
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.160]   has a Windows big Dell PC with two 24 inch screen side by sign.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.920]   And really was a major Windows bigot.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.680]   Got an iPad, got an iPod.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.880]   She wants an iPhone.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.040]   I think it's, it's only a matter of time before a Mac's on her desk.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.360]   So yeah, there's no question.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.480]   There's a halo effect.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.800]   And there is that multiplication, which Andy is talking about.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.920]   We were driving in her day and I was navigating with my phone,
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.400]   right in the Google Maps.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.680]   And at the same time, Jason asked me, well, what's the show notes look like?
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.880]   And I realized I really needed two phones.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.280]   So that I could do both at the same time.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.040]   I got two hands.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.120]   That's how Alex multi, or no, is it you or Scott?
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.160]   I got born to multi tasks with multiple phones.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.440]   I don't do it with my, I don't do it with my, it's, I think it's Scott.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.000]   But I definitely have my iPad and my iPhone open all the time together.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.080]   Well, the phone is perfect because you have two thumbs.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.160]   Yeah, Scott, Scott always said, well, I have multi tasking.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.760]   I have two phones, three phones, four phones.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.880]   On my, on since I, since I do love my word processing on files that are on Dropbox,
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.560]   I actually often wind up using my iPhone as an external screen for my iPad.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.520]   So I can be looking something up in Safari while editing something that's on the same
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.680]   document on the screen of my iPhone that I just left a second ago on the iPad.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:26.080]   So yeah, we, we, we, we need a special t-shirt, hat or button that says, look, I'm just,
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.680]   they, yes, they all happen to be Apple products, but I don't need to use Apple products.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.200]   It's just because they're, this is going to sell, I take it back.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.120]   It's going to sell mobile me, but it may sell Dropbox even more.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.480]   I mean, if you're cloud computing, Dropbox is a good, no, Dropbox is next version.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.080]   I understand we'll not force you to copy the entire Dropbox onto your hard drive.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.280]   That's one negative.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.920]   If you had a 50 gigabyte drop box, that's up trouble here.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.360]   You fill up your hard drive, but if you didn't have to copy everything, that actually makes
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.840]   me insane about Dropbox.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.320]   Yeah, it's the only thing wrong with this.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.920]   Well, it's, it's not, it's, it's a feature for, it's one, it's the reason why I, why I
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.120]   switch to Dropbox instead of box.net.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.000]   The idea that if I have a file on one computer, it's being backed up across five different
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.560]   computers and the cloud simultaneously.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.240]   And I don't really have to think about it.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.520]   For me, there is that extra step of, okay, we have to make sure that we attach our Dropbox,
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.440]   our cloud, our cloud remote server, and make sure that's mounted on every single machine
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.120]   that I really want it on.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.920]   I think the, the, the simple fact that, I don't know what, what kind of broads money
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.120]   or Coke that, that Dropbox has been spreading around, but the fact that every single app
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:37.880]   that supports cloud compute, cloud storage on the iPad supports Dropbox and maybe it supports
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.280]   side desk and maybe it supports box.net.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.040]   But there seems to be this implication that if you're doing the stuff on iOS, you need
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.000]   to support Dropbox first and foremost, that's interesting to me.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   I think it's Coke.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.320]   Sounds like a Warren Zvon record, no matter what.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.880]   It's the super pro.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.040]   It was Coke, but I always.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.600]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   We have a great.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.880]   Yes, I think we do.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   Coke, broads and iOS.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.440]   That's, I like to take a break when we get the show title so I can, I can think about
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.160]   it and absorb it and enjoy it.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.520]   Lander Kehaney is here.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.760]   He's the cult of Mac.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.200]   I want to do move from wired to cult of Mac to do your own thing.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.000]   About 18 months ago.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.200]   Yeah, it's been a good move, I think.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.640]   Now we're getting the silon effect.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.960]   So if you've got a USB device plugged into the laptop, unplug it and plug it in again.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.360]   And this happens with a particular, what chipset is is one chipset that does it.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.280]   It's a weird thing and you actually put it in the other USB.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.280]   Yeah, I put it in the other one and see if that's better.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.080]   We're going to take a break Alex Lindsey is here, Aaron Hilligoss from Big Nerd Ranch,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.560]   the author of a number of books, including a new one for people who want to learn about
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.560]   iPhone programming.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.120]   What's the name of the name of the book?
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.720]   It's called iPhone Programming, the Big Nerd Ranch Guide.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.280]   Easy to remember.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.800]   And it's on Amazon right now and it's actually the text that you guys are using for the class
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.000]   that you're taking right now.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Fantastic text.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   I'm so trilid suggested.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.800]   I wanted to take this class.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   You're missing out.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   It's really good.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   I desperately wanted to.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   As soon as you do an Android class, let me know, okay?
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   You do Android.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   Oh, that was bad.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   We should do it.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   We should do it.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   We should do it in Petaluma.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   That's what we need to do.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.600]   I think you'd find a fine audience of people coming in from everywhere for this class.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.520]   We could totally, I mean, you could totally do a, do a, I want to talk about the apification
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.040]   actually of the Macintosh next because that's something that announced last week.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.080]   I've had time to think about it.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.080]   I know you have and as a developer, Aaron, I probably, you have some real thoughts about
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.480]   what that means for developers.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.560]   We're going to talk about it in just a little bit before we do though.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.520]   Let's talk about go to meeting.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   The great folks at Citrix have brought us the best way to meet online.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   I know Alex uses it.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.960]   We use it all over the place here.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.160]   We don't do a meeting if it's not go to meeting.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.400]   It saves you time and money.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.960]   We're using it constantly.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   On business travel.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.200]   It also makes teleconferences.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.080]   We all do conference calls these days.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.600]   It makes them so much more productive because, you know, we tried to use Skype to do a lot
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   of this stuff.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.080]   I mean, you think that, oh, I can just get a bunch of people on Skype.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   That's just not sharing.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.240]   It is just not stable enough.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.200]   You know, and so what we found is that we really had to go back to go to meeting to make it
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:15.000]   really work because it was a lot more stable, a lot more effective in doing what we want
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.400]   to do.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.880]   You can go to meeting.com/macbreak right now and try it free for 30 days so you don't have
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.840]   to take our word for it.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.240]   Keep people on the same page during the conference calls.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.680]   Everyone on this call can see your screen or they can take control.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.120]   I think up to 15 people at once and any one of them can say, let me show you what's on
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.880]   my screen right now.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.880]   You can collaborate.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.880]   They can follow along with you.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.680]   You can work on the same document together.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.160]   Everyone on the call is more focused, more interested, more engaged.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.440]   You'll save time, be more productive too.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.320]   For sales presentations, for product demos, training sessions, online collaboration, I've
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:53.440]   used it for rehearsing talks, go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.440]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.840]   We know you're going to love it.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.800]   Did you unplug Leander and plug back in?
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   I did, yeah.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   Is it better?
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:03.800]   It's the weirdest thing.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.960]   We use Skype all the time and it seems to be an issue in Internet.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   I don't know.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   It only seems to have one Skype though, right?
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   It's only with Skype.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.960]   Skype and certain headset chipsets.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.960]   Okay, I had trouble.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.920]   I couldn't hear what you guys are saying.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.960]   It was breaking up and there was a delay.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   Now it's better.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   Much better.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960]   The magic of something.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.760]   What's funny is it's gotten to the point now where we don't even panic.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.520]   It used to be this like this Chinese fire.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.520]   Oh my God.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.520]   Oh my God.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.520]   And now it's just like, oh yeah.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.520]   Unplug, plug again.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.880]   So what I have to admit, I was a little wussy.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.320]   I was a little old lady.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.920]   First thing I heard about the App Store, I was like, oh my God, they're going to turn
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.040]   Mac OS into iOS.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.600]   They're going to close it down.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.160]   It's the end of the world.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.240]   It's in fact, I read a column.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.800]   Where was it?
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.560]   Gizmodo, I think, where the where the colonists said, you know, for Apple 2011 is going to
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.000]   be like 1984.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.920]   It's going back to the whole closed thing that they were in vain against back in 1984.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.080]   Now Aaron, you're a developer.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.280]   I'm sure like a lot of developers, you welcome the idea of a store.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.600]   It's good for developers, right?
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.520]   It's great for developers, but you have to remember that there's always the option to
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.320]   sell outside the store.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.920]   So this is just one more channel which through which would you, though, if you had the store,
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920]   would you even bother?
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.040]   Well, as I tweeted last night, that people buy software in basically three modalities.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.200]   And the first one is when you're at CompUSA and you're walking through.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.160]   Okay, that's gone.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.360]   And right on the way out, right?
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.360]   Nice choice.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.680]   They have that they used to have that $2.99.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   Oh, I know.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.680]   I'll go to Newegg.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.160]   Oh, I mean, they get software.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.880]   No, no, no.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.320]   But on the way out, they'd always have that $2.99 made the family tree application.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   Yeah, crap.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.960]   Like, what the heck toss it in the car?
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.880]   They still have that office max and staple.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   Right.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.920]   And that's perfect for the max store because you can put it up there and they'll do the
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.800]   distribution and you're happy to get anything.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   Right.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.680]   Once you get to sort of the $40 mark, people want to try things out beforehand.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.600]   They want to do a 30-day trial.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.480]   And right now it doesn't look like there's any way to do that on the max store.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.160]   You're not allowed to have trial versions of the application.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   And then the third mode is, of course, your boss tells you they're going to spend $100,000
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.000]   on some sort of a database or a business application.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.440]   And there's really no way to do that through the store as well.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.160]   So I think that what's going to happen is that app will evolve.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.960]   They'll recognize that those higher price points, people really want to try things out.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.520]   Yeah, you can't imagine selling Final Cut Studio in an app store.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.680]   It's not an app.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   It's an application.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.000]   Well, I think that the, I think you're going to get to a point where they're selling
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   everything through it or there's an option to sell at any price at any size.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.080]   I don't think it's going to happen immediately.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:56.760]   I think mostly what we're going to see in the app store are my guesses, $2 to $200.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.840]   I think that's the range that makes the most sense.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.280]   I think that after that, I mean, I think over time, though, I think that that happens.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:09.880]   And I think it also, it simplifies for the developer a lot of things other than just e-commerce.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.280]   It also simplifies all the anti-piracy stuff that you would normally have to go through.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.280]   I mean, this is a really complicated process.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.280]   Well, that's great for developers.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.600]   You don't have to worry about anybody stealing your stuff.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   It's good.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.240]   It's good for developers who haven't done it yet.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.520]   Isn't there piracy on the, for files on the iOS?
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.520]   Very little.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.520]   It's rampant.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.520]   It's rampant.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.520]   Very little.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.520]   Which is it?
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.520]   Why is rampant?
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.520]   You think it's rampant?
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.640]   What I had to say, yeah, it was like, there's a huge repository.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   Well, there's there.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   You have to jailbreak.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.800]   You have to jailbreak it, which is less than 1%.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.760]   I mean, it's less than 1%.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   We don't know how many phones jailbreak.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.400]   I mean, I think we have no idea.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.400]   We have no idea.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.800]   But I think from, I don't know a person.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.280]   I mean, I know three people who have jailbroken their phone.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.280]   And you're a nerd.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.600]   There's a lot of people around me that would normally do it.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.240]   No one bothers because it's just too much trouble.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.240]   And so the thing is, is that-
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.880]   Well, it used to be you go to a website and you just let you know you could do it slider.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.320]   And a lot of people were doing it to get tethering.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.720]   So maybe it's a little less now that AT&T offers it officially.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.160]   But there were a lot of people who were jailbroken.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.760]   I think that a lot of the people that I know that jail broke the first version stopped
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.440]   because it was so inconvenient as the updates went.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.720]   I jailbroken, unlocked and all that stuff.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.520]   It turns into too much trouble because Apple-
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.000]   It affects reliability and you don't gain that much.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   There's not that much in Sedia.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   All right.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   But here's my-
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Can I finish one thing?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.040]   Yes, but before that, here's the thing that's going to be more interesting is the friction
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.920]   for companies like Adobe who have their own systems to install to manage your-
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.920]   There's no flash on this-
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.920]   There's no flash on this privacy here.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.920]   Well, I'm not talking about flash.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.640]   I'm just talking about installing Photoshop.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:52.320]   They have one of the viruses that Adobe got by buying Macromedia was this horrible management
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.360]   system that they deal with with all the, you know, the certification and all this other
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.200]   crap that is now been added to Photoshop.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   Photoshop must be nice and easy to install.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   Now it's a pain in the neck.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:07.400]   But all of that stuff, if it becomes the normal thing is to buy it through the app store,
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.920]   that stuff becomes- You can't do that anymore.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.920]   That's right.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.480]   You have to use the Apple standard installer, which is a package maker is the tool.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.480]   Right.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.040]   And the interesting thing about that is that people will, as they get used to using the
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.240]   app store, they will become less and less open to applications that do it any other
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   way.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.760]   I think that's the- I don't think Apple has to ever turn off the pipe.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.240]   I think that what will happen with me is that if everything is on the- of 90% is on
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   the app store, the 10% has to be really, really good for me to think about, you know, going
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.000]   through the hassle of running a package.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.360]   One of the other things that's great about the new app store is it's going to take care
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.560]   of updates for you as well.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.480]   So right now a lot of people are adding what's called sparkle to their application.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.760]   You see this, a little panel pops up and it says, "Hey, there's a new version.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.120]   You want to download it."
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.480]   And now it'll all happen to the store and you won't have that in every application.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.680]   I understand that developers are also getting crash reporting for free now finally, where
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:06.280]   you can get access to crash logs without having to basically beg, borrow, steal, cajole, or
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.600]   once again, coconut hookers with Apple to find out what was actually going on with the
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.480]   CPU when your app crashed.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.720]   I know that a lot of apps, they spend a lot of time building or licensing that sort of
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   infrastructure.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.480]   I've talked to two or three different developers right now who said that that alone is one
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.960]   of the things I've been asking Apple for for three or four or five years as there have
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.440]   been iOS developers and other gladiators.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.760]   Also, my understanding isn't correct me if I'm wrong, but there really is no DRM in apps
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.120]   that are going to be sold to the Mac OS app store.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.160]   My understanding is that essentially it's just a more standardized version of what you're
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.000]   getting with shareware right now where you download something that doesn't work until
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.040]   you insert it when you download shareware, it recognizes you haven't paid for it.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.960]   Until you pay for it, when you pay for it, there's like a little receipt or something
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.840]   that's located somewhere one of your directories so that VB edit or Omni-Outline or something
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.600]   can say, "Oh, he's paid for this while make sure I run in full mode."
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.320]   It's not that the, my understanding is that the Mac OS app store will not put DRM on the
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   apps, will just simply do a formal mechanism for having those receipts someplace so that
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.960]   it can recognize that an app has been paid for.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:19.160]   In fact, it says in the app store agreement, apps that require license keys or implement
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.480]   their own copy protection will be rejected.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.920]   In fact, we're starting to see now the app store agreement and it's interesting.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.920]   No beta, demo, trial or test versions.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:33.080]   Now, you could, but also no requirement that you use the app store.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.160]   Well, okay, I understand that.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.080]   Everybody says that as the excuse for this.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.920]   Well, here's my doomsday scenario and maybe Leander will back me up because I'm not going
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   to do this, Leander.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:52.120]   Here's my doomsday scenario is everybody loves this.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.120]   Consumers love this.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.120]   It's easy.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.120]   Developers love this.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   It's easy.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:01.760]   Everybody loves it so much that fewer and fewer people side install to the point where
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.520]   in a year, two years, they just slowly phase it out.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.000]   Nobody's going to miss it because nobody uses it and doesn't that really, isn't that
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.680]   really where Apple would like to go with this?
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   Am I wrongly, Andrew?
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.160]   Well, unfortunately, you broke out.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.480]   You know, you broke up right.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.920]   Just agree with me, Leander.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   Just say yes.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.440]   Just say no, I'm just saying.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:28.320]   I think that this is it seems to me and I know I'm being a little old lady here and
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.000]   I don't want to be chicken little, but it does look to me like this is so appealing.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.400]   You just described all the great reasons for this and consumers love it.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.280]   The current software buying system is completely broken.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:43.480]   You know, like a nice user friendly app store would be a great benefit, I think.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.720]   And such a good benefit that eventually side installs go away.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:52.880]   I don't know if that's true, but I mean, I prefer to really focus on all the things
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.280]   that will benefit consumers.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.200]   And I think it's interesting that, of course, like the day they announce this, I'm setting
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.440]   up a brand new MacBook and I'm going through all the crap I have to go through because
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.600]   there isn't one centralized store that simply says, "Oh, you bought these nine apps.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   Right?
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   Well, let's re-download them.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   We'll authorize them all for you."
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.160]   I had to download the trial version of Photoshop, the trial version of Aputure because I needed
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.200]   to go in that day and I could find the Aputure installed this.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.760]   I didn't have my license key.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.880]   I couldn't find anything with my copy of CS5.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.120]   I guess in a way, this works so well.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.760]   Apple doesn't even care about side loads because, well, everybody's using this.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.520]   We can allow for people like Leo will allow side loads except that I won't be able to
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.360]   buy any apps that way because all the app developers are going to say, "Well, no, we
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.560]   really would like to be in the store."
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:44.120]   For instance, and this is another thing that worries me, it says in the App Store guidelines
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:50.400]   that apps that look too similar to Apple products or apps bundled with the Mac, for example,
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.840]   Finder, iChat, iTunes, and Dashboard will also be rejected.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.840]   No, this is something I was talking about today, though.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.760]   I think that when I look at the agreement here in the worries that installs in people
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:07.320]   including myself, I think I understand why Apple spent an entire year not outlining what
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.800]   their app rejection and access is scary.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.160]   Well, because if you say that, look, if you create an app called iMail that looks exactly
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.000]   like our version of Mail and duplicates all of its features, we're going to reject you
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.480]   because you're really trying to copy our stick.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.040]   If you create a brand new Mail, then we'll let it through.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.240]   Once you start telling people...
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.240]   Thunderbird.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.240]   Thunderbird.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.400]   I'm saying they started me.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.480]   What I'm saying is that once you say that I'm going to give you a list of 53s and why
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:45.000]   I might reject an app, one of which is that it's a dumb app, it doesn't really do anything.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.640]   If you're outlining that, please be aware that we're not going to give you, we're not
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.680]   going to necessarily let in another four-function calculator, you start making a lot of people
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.560]   worry about, "Well, but geez, my application just does one simple thing by adding something
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.960]   to the menu bar. Is it going to be rejected?" because it's a regard as a simple thing.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   Sometimes...
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.760]   I think that you have to be aware that sometimes you can't really obsess over everything that
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.760]   can happen just because it's...
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.760]   You're right.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.240]   I don't want to chase a chimera.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.560]   There's no evidence that this is going to happen.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.560]   I feel like what's happening...
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.560]   I actually wish it...
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   Go ahead.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.280]   Well, I wish Apple was more strict about what it led to the App Store.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.280]   I think that the iOS App Store is completely broken.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.800]   It's 200,000 pieces of crap and there's 50 that are good.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.400]   The current system of finding the good stuff is that's completely broken too.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   If they did that, that would be a big disaster if they did that on the Mac Store because it
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.840]   would just be more confusing than the current system, which is like go out and find it for
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.840]   yourself.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   Well, I think that one of the problems that...
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.640]   I think the more useful it would be.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:51.560]   The problem is that without being able to download demos, without being able to really
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.520]   test it, it is going to be something that is going to be much harder to figure out what
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.520]   you want.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520]   Right.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.520]   Going down...
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.320]   And something that Aaron and I were talking about earlier is it would be really easy to
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.880]   run demos in a closed system.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   It seems frustrating.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.280]   You do an Android right now by offering you a refund within 24 hours.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.520]   You download it, you try it.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.520]   You think I'm weak.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.280]   I'm not as worried about that because I had a whole list of things last week of this would
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.600]   be a horrible idea if any of these put a number out of the year.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.200]   I remember things are true.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.320]   And one of them was if you have to basically sign your soul over to Apple to say that Omni
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:30.880]   Outliner now belongs to the Mac OS App Store, I can't sell it or offer it in any place else,
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   that's not true.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.560]   So if you demo where it can be covered by, you will have a link.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.720]   If it works like the iOS App Store, there'll be just the standard link to Omni Group developer
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   site.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.920]   You can click on that and then from that site, you can then download and install a demo version
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.920]   of it.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.840]   So, I mean, if I were writing a column about it, and I'm not sure where I'm going to write
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.840]   about it so far.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.800]   And I think the headline is, I can't get worked up about this and that bothers me.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.400]   But I think the end has a really important point, which is the App Store is essentially
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.160]   broken in that it's so hard to find something good.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.000]   And the problem is that the reviews all say this is a great app or it's a terrible app
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.880]   and that's not actually the information I want.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.960]   What I want to know is is this the best to do list?
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.960]   We need it.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960]   We need a way to demo stuff.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.880]   We need a comparative system where someone who's tried both can say this one's better
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.280]   and thus it would make a recommendation.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.360]   Well, I look at reviews and I always look for the name of another application.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.560]   Because frequently the reviews will say it's not as good as X.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.560]   And then I'll say, oh, good.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.560]   Let me look at it.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.560]   Let me look at it.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.560]   That's a useful review.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.560]   That's a useful review.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.760]   Well, I think that this is an issue, an iTunes, it's an issue in the App Store.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.920]   I think that I still think that there's a room for something about curation among the
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.080]   users.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.840]   And I think that the answer I know this is going to be, this is not going to happen.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.720]   But I think that the curation is some way, if someone is writing reviews on their, you
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:53.040]   know, within Ping or within the App Store or something, and people then buy it because
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.720]   they, you know, or whatever or things that they recommended.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.120]   You know, they get some little, you know, affiliate sale.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.240]   You know, you could end up with a lot of people making lists of apps that are really
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:09.240]   good and people then developing a trusted following so that, you know, there's a certain
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240]   number.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.640]   I mean, a lot of people buy the stuff that I mean, I buy this, I buy most of the apps
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.480]   that Andy or Leo or anyone else, you know, when people recommend them here on the show
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.440]   because I know that they hang down on the and they played with them and it's a trusted
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.440]   source.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.840]   I think we need more trusted sources and you need to find more ways of integrating.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:29.120]   It just, it looks to me like Apple's reinventing more than just, you know, adding some iOS
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.120]   features.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.280]   It looks to me like Apple's reinventing computing that I absolutely agree.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.600]   I full screen the flick and flick.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.600]   It's the whole thing.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.800]   You know, and I bless the court.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   Yeah, God bless them.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.360]   Nobody's really made any strides in UI or it's in advance.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   The clients.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:46.000]   I mean, that's what we're going towards is and a lot of us are hanging onto the geek factor
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   that we grew up with.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.760]   I mean, I get frustrated that I don't have enough slots and I don't have this and I don't
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.360]   have that and I can't customize it.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.480]   But for normal users, I agree and that's what scares me is that normal users are going to
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.480]   love this.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.480]   The developers are going to love this.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.560]   There's not going to be a whole lot of incentive for geeks, you know, to play.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   I mean, look at the iPhone.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.000]   I don't think it's going to happen tomorrow, but I think the three to five years from now,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.920]   we could see, you know, a very.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   That's fine.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.920]   I'm small.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.920]   I'm not going to worry about it.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.920]   I can, you know, there's always Linux.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.680]   There's one more sort of funny thing in the agreement, which is that you can't show an end
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   user license.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.800]   I love that because Apple's not Tory.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.520]   I mean, look at iTunes every four seconds.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.880]   I get a new end user license.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.960]   But you can imagine like an open source project might think that their license is actually
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.320]   a very important part of the product.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:33.080]   They may even be required to display it.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   Does it come down to how benevolent we feel our fearless leader is?
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.320]   I think my big work.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:46.480]   I get a little bit hesitant when I hear a lot of concerns that are what I call phase two
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.480]   arguments.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.480]   Right.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.480]   That's my two people.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.680]   People imagine that you get to the end of the first chapter where everybody's using
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.840]   this and everybody's loving it.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.640]   And then someone always has this fantasy about Steve Jobs or any CEO in a leather swivel chair
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.640]   is saying, and now.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   Phase two.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.080]   And you can't trust corporations.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.240]   You always have to be aware of what rights you receive.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.480]   You're receiving what rights you're giving away.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.600]   But when you say that, well, here is all the features that I'm being given in exchange
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.640]   for giving away very, very little.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.120]   I'm not really worried that much about phase two.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.560]   So long as I have an escape boat, if phase two actual, if the if the if the if the panel
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.600]   truck pulls up in front of the house and remember that agreement, you click through.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   Okay, get in the truck.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600]   Right.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.080]   As long as I have an escape route, that's that's fine by me.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.080]   I just love this.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.080]   You know, like I love this MacBook Air.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.080]   There's a wonderful thing.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.040]   I would hate to have to put Linux on it.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.400]   That sounds like a threat.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.320]   I don't want to have to put Linux on this.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.320]   No, I was just talking about it.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.840]   It's shy before we had an open source.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.920]   I love OS 10.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.280]   I think the I think OS 10 is beautiful.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.720]   But it always just worries me a little bit when I hear Steve Jobs say windows is open
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:57.320]   that, you know, I don't think Steve has, you know, at at root any interest in anything
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.920]   but user experience, you know, and ultimately Apple's business success.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.920]   But I do believe he's a product guy.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.040]   And so if he says this is a superior experience for everybody, it's more secure.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.440]   By the way, it solves the security issues.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.640]   And a lot of windows users will be looking over here saying, well, again, when you're
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.640]   talking about business users, when you're talking about casual users, when you're talking
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   about student users, almost everybody, you know, 90%, you know, 90 90.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.240]   Look how the iPad is selling.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   This is the iPad.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.480]   And it's selling like hotcakes.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.280]   It's more I think it isn't it more sales than any other device.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.840]   Web Web 75 96 says stop being a drama queen Leo.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.480]   This is why you're not invited to Apple events.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   I'm so glad.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.880]   I'm so glad to finally know.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.480]   I can see Steve looking at the last drama queen.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.480]   But I think that, you know, there is the.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.120]   We're not going to fight Leo.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   He has attitude.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:55.640]   I mean, 10 years from now, we are not going to be clicking on packages.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.320]   You know, like, I mean, I think that's the reality.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.320]   Probably five years.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:03.280]   That was one of the big steps forward to be honest that Ubuntu made with Linux.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.560]   Linux was a nightmare installing stuff.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.200]   Ubuntu created a Linux store actually before even before then.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.920]   Lindo's created a Linux store that made it easy to install apps.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.080]   Now I have to admit it didn't turn things around for Linux, but it was a major step.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.960]   And for me anyway, to be able to recommend Linux to normal people.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.400]   Well, now you can install apps like you can on Windows.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400]   And now we're going to the next step.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.960]   Now you can install apps like you can on the iPad and iPhone.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.040]   And I think that that's going to be I think that people want people get used to it.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.160]   I think it's going to be very hard to get them.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.240]   They're going to be like, Oh, I had to go to their website and I had to download a package
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.960]   and then I had to double click on it.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.680]   Now when I the biggest thing that happens for me is the chain like upgrading my system.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.720]   I like to like when I buy a new computer or I buy or I or I update, you know, to a big
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.920]   version of OS 10.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.000]   I want to wipe my drive clean, install it, and then put everything back on.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   It's traumatic.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.400]   I mean, it's like it's days of my time to get everything reinstalled and re cushioned.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.880]   And the I and when I look at what it what it takes to do that on my iPad, I'm just like,
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.640]   this is where I want to go.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.680]   And and stuff like this app store make that possible.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.640]   Let me ask Aaron Hillicas, you're as a developer and a guy write software.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.600]   You can't do open source software on iOS because you cannot share the code, right?
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.080]   I mean, there's you couldn't put a GPL program on iOS.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:21.280]   I don't think because you'd have to reshare the code and I I suspect I don't know.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.520]   I don't see any reason why you couldn't publish your source code.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.680]   Are you allowed to publish your source code if under the Apple developer agreement?
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.200]   Okay, people, Sam, but put source code out all the time.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.900]   I keep thinking in terms of the app store about the Christmas morning effect where someone
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.800]   has just gotten their new Mac on Christmas morning and they open up and they'll say,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   let's go to the store.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.960]   Oh, can you imagine how much with a gift certificate?
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.960]   Don't buy them software.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.960]   Just buy the give a $200 gift certificate.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.200]   As a developer, I feel all warm and fuzzy.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   I think about that Christmas morning.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.480]   Well, you saw what Pixelmator the people at Pixelmator said.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.040]   We don't have to think about users at all anymore.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.440]   Well, to accept to the degree that we want to make something that users want because we
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:04.200]   know that all the marketing, all of that stuff is now handled by an app store.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.960]   Pixelmator was thrilled by this.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.320]   They think this is fantastic.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:12.200]   And for an inexpensive product that's trying to compete with Adobe, which is what Pixelmator
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.200]   is, this is perfect.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.960]   Well, and I think for consumers, I think we're going to see as we reduce the friction between
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.920]   purchase and development and purchase, as we reduce the friction between of piracy,
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:28.120]   there's going to be more and more downward pressure on the cost per purchase.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.200]   It's not going to $500 apps are going to have a harder time.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.880]   It's going to be much easier to sell them for $100, $150.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.280]   Now, some developers may bemoan that, but I know a lot of the reason that I think as
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.360]   we get that downward pressure, part of it is that when you're buying, when you're paying
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.600]   $600 for an application, you're paying for a lot of people pirating it.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.600]   When that goes away, it makes it more efficient.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.960]   You can sell it for less and make the same income if people can get their head around
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:50.960]   that.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.960]   That's right.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.000]   And another thing that's interesting to me and Aaron, I want to check this against you.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.920]   I've been looking at the percentage of Mac users who are actually going outside of Apple
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.440]   for software.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.080]   And I've come across four or five different numbers, but it's always a number that's so
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:11.880]   surprisingly low that in the low six figures that anywhere between $150,000 to about $300,
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.440]   and I think the highest, I saw was 380,000 people, Mac users are actually buying software
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.440]   that is not licensed and branded by Apple.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:25.160]   And if all the app store does is introduced, if people need to see that Apple logo before
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.800]   they'll make a transaction, if that allows these independent developers to be a little
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.960]   bit more present, a little bit more found, it just brings more money to the table.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.360]   And does that sound like that?
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:39.360]   No, I think that's a huge opportunity that suddenly Apple is creating a conduit for developers
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:44.760]   to get things into the hands of users, not just the nerdy users like who are sitting at
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:48.480]   this table, but the grandparents.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.920]   It's such an exciting thing when a developer gets their app into the Mac and the stores
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.760]   at the mall in a box.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.800]   And you pay a lot of money for that.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.080]   The distributors take a cut to get an end cap.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.560]   You've got to make all sorts of promises.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.560]   It's not a good thing.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.920]   It's not a good system.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.840]   But it's still developers are dying to do it because they don't have to anymore because
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:13.800]   you get an end cap by being featured on the eye apps store or whatever they call it, the
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   Mac apps store.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.320]   The other thing is I think that we're going to be looking at a future if this continues
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.640]   to expand where OS 10 doesn't cost us anything to upgrade.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.280]   You know where it's not it's no longer a hundred and a hundred dollars.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:27.640]   They've been moving down because they're making money on the fact that you have it.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.760]   You bought the hardware and you have the software and they're making money on you buying through
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.520]   the app store.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.000]   I think that it would be really interesting to see other models like that.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.360]   For instance, what if Photoshop was getting 30% of every plugin developer's income?
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.960]   You could get to a point where Photoshop they could sell for $100, $200, even give it away
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.360]   because they're making more money on plugging.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.360]   You have to turn it into a platform.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.120]   A Photoshop becomes a platform as opposed to.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.800]   I think this model could be used in a lot of places.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:59.800]   Let me talk this out.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.280]   Anything else you want to say about this?
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   Oh, we lost Leander.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.760]   Let me call him back here.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   He got exactly 58 minutes and 50 seconds.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.640]   I think that that's the kind of thing.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.360]   Have you seen this thing on CNET?
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.200]   An emulator that's running DOS and Windows on an iPad?
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.880]   DOS on Windows on an iPad.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:24.120]   I'm going to buy the I-DOS emulator.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.840]   I want the I-DOS emulator.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:26.840]   That sounds great.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.840]   Oh, shoot.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.840]   Okay, hang on.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.840]   He's just trashed his iPad.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.320]   This is why we have an app store.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:37.880]   No, no, I just realized I'm going to have to go buy this immediately because this is
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:45.400]   an app that should not approve, but will definitely be taken down for a second.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:51.160]   It's just a quick, everybody download I-DOS immediately.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.760]   It seems like an emulator.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.520]   It's called I-DOS.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.760]   It's probably just, you know, DOS is so easy to implement.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.920]   I'm learning this about as quickly as I'm saying this.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:07.520]   I don't know if it's actually like a Nigerian porn site scam app, but...
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.400]   Now everybody really is downloading.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.640]   Something Apple stores are like, "Let's take a break.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.880]   I'm going to get Leander back on.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.920]   We're having trouble with his connection, but he'll be back in just a moment before we
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.920]   get back to this."
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:24.760]   And a major security flaw, which I will demonstrate on your iPhone or any 4.1 iOS device.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.760]   Oh, this is fun.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:31.480]   But before we do that, let me talk a little bit about our friends at hover.com.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.720]   It's domain name registration done right.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.600]   If you go to Macbreak.hover.com, you can see what they do.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.120]   It's very clean, very simple.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:43.240]   I don't know if you've registered a domain name lately, but boy, let me tell you it is
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.520]   a pain in the tuckus.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.320]   You say, "Yes, I want that domain name."
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.400]   And then there's 80 clicks before you actually get it because they say, "Well, maybe you'd
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.600]   like to buy this or that or this or that or that."
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.800]   Hover is just clean.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   It's simple.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   Here's what they do.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   You buy a domain name.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.800]   You do have an option if you wish to have email.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:05.080]   And I think for a lot of people, this is the reason to get a domain name.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:09.800]   If you every three years have to tell somebody, "Oh, my email address has changed.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.000]   I just have one email address I've had it for 15 years.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.600]   It doesn't go to anywhere.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.480]   I own the domain name and then I forward it to whichever email provider I'm currently
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.480]   using sometimes.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.920]   Gmail, right now Gmail before that was fast, mail before that was Yahoo!
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.920]   Mail.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.920]   I don't have to tell anybody anything.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.880]   I just say it's always the same because I have my own domain name.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.800]   It's so nice to have your own domain name.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:34.680]   And when you have kids or as a gift, having your own domain name is awfully nice.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.360]   Do you're downloading items right now?
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.360]   No.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.800]   The availability of this item has changed.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.640]   The same item may be available with a different price or elsewhere on the store.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.080]   They took it off.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.080]   They pulled it.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.080]   Already?
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.080]   It looked really cool.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.680]   Here's a CNET article.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.680]   Here's what it looked like.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.520]   Oh, thank you, CNET.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:56.440]   It looked like a grimy, like DOS machine with command line.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   Oh, look.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.440]   It's a PC junior.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.440]   Yeah, it's gone.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.440]   Oh, man.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.880]   Someone needs to send me emails about this before they put it in CNET.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:04.880]   Exactly.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.880]   We need the back channel.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:06.880]   What for that?
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.880]   It's wrong with you.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.880]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:13.480]   If you go there right now, you'll save 10% off your domain name.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.320]   Just use the offer code Macbreak.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.040]   They have a new no-hold policy for customer service calls during business hours.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.200]   You will not be put on hold.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.200]   You will get the answer.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:27.000]   And I tell you, the last time I'm moving my domains to hover, I got them locked.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   I'm just really annoying.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.600]   So it's going to have to wait until December for like, Twitter and a couple of others because
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.320]   I changed the contact address.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.280]   And now the domain company I'm with says, "Oh, you can't change.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.880]   You can't transfer these over until December now."
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.480]   They got you.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.120]   So I called.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.520]   I was transferred three times.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:49.040]   I was on hold for a total of 20 minutes, not at hover.com.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.320]   I can't wait to get everything over there.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.520]   Try it right now, Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.440]   The nice guys at two cows have been doing domains direct for a long time.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.520]   This is their rebranding.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.800]   I think that it's just a great company.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.800]   Hover.com.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.640]   Macbreak.hover.com is the address.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.360]   Save 10% with the offer code Macbreak today.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.360]   All right, let me see.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.640]   Yeah, it's gone.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.640]   I doss.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.480]   A little bit late with the breaking story there.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.720]   Thanks for teasing us.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   But you got it, Andy.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:19.920]   Well, this underlines Leo's.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.920]   Did you just get it?
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:26.440]   Someone tweeted this to me, which made me immediately look for the information about
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.520]   it, which led me to go, "Oh, crap, I got to download this.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.640]   They're not going to get sued by so many people."
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.280]   And immediately Apple--
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:41.480]   Doing a DOS emulator on the iPad, that's almost like a suicide by cops or a scenario.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.480]   I mean, who would really like--
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.480]   Who would really like--
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.480]   Like, Gillis, Microsoft, Snipers, and what do you think it's out?
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   Who improved?
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   Dude, my dane will be gone.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.480]   Who approved it?
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   And then that person no longer working at Apple, somebody else came in and pulled the
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   plug on it.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.680]   But this is an example of--
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.080]   This is exactly what you're worried about.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.080]   What I'm worried about.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.280]   I mean, this is a completely harmless product.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.760]   It's DOS for crying out loud.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.760]   Who cares?
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.080]   DOS is a concept by which we measure our pain.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.400]   It's not a harmless product, sir.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.200]   OK, thank you.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.200]   Leander's back.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   Sorry about that, Leander.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   I'm not sure what happened, but we're glad to have you back.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.200]   So am I connecting this whole flaky?
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.200]   It's that Skype thing.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.280]   If you were using FaceTime, you'd be all set.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.280]   Oh, I sit.
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   Next time, huh?
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   You know, you should upgrade to one of those modular handsets, handjacks.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   Maybe that's a--
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   So here's the deal.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.960]   I'm going to do it on the air here, and I'll show you it's not fixed yet.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.640]   It's pretty simple to duplicate.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:41.400]   I'll have to do it in front of your face again, Aaron, because I have to hold my iPhone up
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.680]   to the camera.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.840]   So let's see if I can do this like Ginger Rogers upside down and backwards.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.920]   I have a lock on my iPhone, right?
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.920]   So if I do that, it's locked.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.560]   But I can still make an emergency call.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.080]   All phones are required to do that, by the way.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.200]   So I say emergency call.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.160]   Now I make up a fake emergency call number.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.200]   I'm going to put in five pound signs.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:02.240]   Press call and immediately press the top button.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.240]   It didn't work.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.680]   I have to do it again.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.600]   It takes a couple of tries sometimes.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.640]   Do, do.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:15.560]   And now I have access to all my contacts, to all my missed calls, to my voicemails.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.440]   I can change my voicemail.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.240]   I have access to the phone application.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.520]   I didn't unlock it.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:25.000]   I just made an emergency call and immediately pressed the top button on the iPhone.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.280]   Kind of a bug.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   That's a little.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.160]   This happened once before, like not so long ago.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.600]   Anyway, just, there's nothing to say about it.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.600]   It's not patched.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   It's in all 4.1 devices.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:38.440]   And I'm assuming that we're going to see a patch soon.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.480]   That's a bigger hole.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.000]   That's a bigger hole than, uh, they've told everybody about it.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.520]   By the way, if you do this to your phone, just a word of warning, your phone now will
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.640]   be stuck in the phone mode until you turn it off and turn it back on.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.920]   And I can't get it out of that phone, that call mode.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.640]   Oh, so you can't get to the rest of the phone, but you can get to the contact.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.400]   It's only get to the phone application.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.400]   But that does mean I have all the contact, this person's contact numbers.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.400]   I can make phone calls.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   Right.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   Uh, I can call.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:02.400]   Afghanistan.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   I can call off.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.400]   I could change the voicemail.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.400]   I can listen to all the voicemails.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   I could change.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   So it's just the phone app that you have.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   Exactly.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.880]   It, it, it, it disables the homes button, the home button.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.720]   So it's not like you can watch other apps, but still that's, that's pretty bad.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   It's pretty bad.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.960]   I don't want people to have access to all my phone numbers.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:20.400]   Every, every wife who thinks is her husband is cheating on her knows this trick by now.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.400]   I'm sure.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.920]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:23.920]   Very good point.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.320]   It could be quite useful ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.320]   Right?
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.720]   But most of them ladies.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:35.120]   Please favor our sponsors.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.880]   Thank you very much for that little tip.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:39.880]   Nothing more to say about it.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.960]   It is there and, and that's kind of a problem.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:42.960]   Don't leave your phone out.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.280]   Don't leave your phone lying around.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.760]   People can get into it.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.800]   FaceTime also had some security problems.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:52.120]   They fixed them very quickly, but there were some fairly glaring security holes in the
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:57.400]   desktop FaceTime for Macintosh, which Apple patched because they didn't need to download
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.400]   a patch.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.360]   They just needed to change how their servers worked.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:05.160]   You would navigate through FaceTime's preferences menu to the view account page once they're
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:08.640]   who, you, again, just like having, you have to have physical access to the iPhone.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:13.120]   You'd have to have physical access to the computer, but you could from the view account
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.320]   page change the password, right?
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:19.600]   And then give yourself access to the FaceTime account.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.280]   And oh, not just a FaceTime account, but when you change a password, it gives you access
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.240]   to all the other Apple accounts like iTunes and everything else.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:31.560]   So the key on this is, well, I guess it's probably all right.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:35.440]   You should, if you, if somebody had access to your computer in the first, say, eight
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:39.160]   hours of FaceTime, you might want to worry about it, but Apple has changed it by simply
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.560]   changing their server settings.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.640]   So that one's easy to one to fix.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.840]   We're also hearing reports, and I'm going to try this soon that the new MacBook Airs
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:48.840]   don't work with Skype.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:53.280]   So Dan, our chat remod says he made some Skype calls.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.280]   So he said he's fine.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.760]   I've just downloaded Skype on the air.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:56.760]   We'll see.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.920]   Have any of you, you Skype on your MacBook Air yet, Lander?
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:06.840]   Not in the MacBook Air, but we get them reports that it's maybe a more general problem because
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.440]   people say they can't do it on their iMac or their MacBook.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.440]   Oh, that's bad.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.440]   Hmm.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:15.320]   I don't know what the, the common factor is, but I don't know because I was just the,
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.040]   just the, you know, we make Mac, you're, you're probably on a Mac right now.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   I'm not sure what you land her.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   Oh, man.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.040]   Mac Pro.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.040]   So you're making a Skype call.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.040]   Andy's making a Skype call.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.240]   I don't think Andy's using Windows for this.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.240]   Okay.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:32.360]   I can't, when I can't run Skype on my Mac, it's, I usually blame Skype, not the Mac.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.280]   I'm logging in right now.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:35.840]   Let's see.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.200]   Remember password sign in.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.680]   Seems to be running.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.960]   What, Lander, what are they saying is, is not working.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.960]   Is it just not making calls?
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.400]   I just glanced at it, but I think, yeah, I don't know.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.640]   I actually wrote the comments in detail, but I saw they were complaints from people on
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:53.200]   iMacs and other machines.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:56.600]   As long as they're talking about, there've been a lot of complaints on the Apple forms
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:00.440]   about the new iPhoto 11, erasing people's photo collections.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   It's nuts.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:08.760]   That's been a bug I came across in one of the last versions as well where it, it, it,
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.720]   it actually was recoverable, but it was a, it was a very scary experience to have it
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.720]   all.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.160]   It's, it's part of the updating.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.120]   Somehow the index got screwed up.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:22.600]   This was, this happened, I think in 10 or nine or iPhoto 9, I guess that, that it lost
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:26.720]   contact with the, with the, the index and suddenly appear that I lost all my.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.600]   I think when you have, you know, when you do a big upgrade like this, often they have
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.960]   to upgrade the database.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:36.600]   I'm sure that's what's going on is it's upgrading the database of the iPhone, I photo pictures.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:41.000]   And if something goes wrong, you could have data corruption as many, as many or more people
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.360]   are saying, no, no, it's just fine.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.040]   So, well, and the other thing to remember is that before you lose, lose your mind, I
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.440]   don't know, on, on in panic, remember that iPhoto and aperture, I mean, this is not a
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.960]   best case scenario, but they are not, it's not even the originals.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.000]   The originals are all in a package.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.720]   So it's not like you're going to, you wouldn't really lose all the images.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.800]   You would just lose the connection.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.800]   It would be a pain in the neck.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.360]   You would lose the metadata.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   You'd lose it.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.000]   But if you had to read the originals, they're still there.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   It's not like a delete.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.360]   They're hidden inside the library, right?
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.120]   So you have an iPhoto library, you right click on the library, right?
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.120]   What is that?
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.120]   Show.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.120]   Yeah, right click.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.120]   And then you can show package contents.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.680]   Inside the package contents, you'll see a folder that says original photos.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.440]   That's your originals.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.960]   One hopes intact.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.880]   When I lost quote unquote, lost the data, the first thing I did was went and made sure
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.280]   that that was still available when it was.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.320]   I'm pretty sure that's true.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.440]   If, you know, this is always the terror that any developer.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.880]   You're writing an open source replacement for core data.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.680]   You probably know more about this than anybody else.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.680]   Whenever you change the format of the database that you're keeping track of the metadata
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.760]   in, it's a dangerous game.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.800]   And especially when you have so many users.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.880]   Why would you do that?
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.880]   Why would you change it?
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.880]   Performance.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.800]   You have a better way of doing it.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.800]   Is Apple using core data?
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.960]   I imagine they use core data for everything.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.520]   I don't think there's in core data behind that.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.520]   Or SQLite.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.920]   It may be SQLite, but I don't think it's core data.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.920]   Oh, interesting.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   I should go and look.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   I'm not sure.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.200]   People may not know, but Aaron's writing an open source replacement for core data.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.640]   Why would you replace a stock Apple library like that?
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:16.240]   So core data relies on the relational model that all your data is in tables.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.640]   And when you talk about something like iTunes, where you have playlists that have an order,
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.920]   it doesn't really fit in very well with the relational model.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.920]   So what I've tried to do is something a little bit.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.000]   You're a no-sequel kind of guy.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.280]   I'm a no-sequel kind of guy.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.280]   That's neat.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280]   So it's a no-sequel version of this?
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.280]   Exactly.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.280]   Something like core data, but it's a no-sequel.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.280]   It's called BNR.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.280]   BNR persistence.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   Big nerd ranch persistence.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.280]   Got it.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.440]   And you get the source on GitHub if you want it.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440]   That's neat.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:45.640]   I can't think of a lot of cases where people are replacing those core Mac functionalities
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.640]   with--
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.920]   Yeah, it's relatively rare.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   Well, good on you.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.360]   Skype is not working on my MacBook Air.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.360]   It wasn't able to log into the Skype server, and it says, "Please check your network settings
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.160]   and try again, even though I am, in fact, on the network."
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.320]   So maybe there is an issue with Skype.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.960]   Trying to think of what that would be.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.160]   Yeah, because that could be a Skype.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.400]   It could be a Skype.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:16.720]   And problem, if it's not seeing the Skype server, I'll try it again, and we shall see.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.400]   Does not come with Flash either, although that's a simple thing to install.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.120]   I'm going to go as long as I can without installing Flash.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.880]   See how long I can go without installing Flash.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.280]   That might be kind of intriguing.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.200]   I found that I was surprised at how much Flash was in every web page that I used when
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.520]   I turned on, you know, click to Flash.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.200]   You know, when I installed Click to Flash, you know, where suddenly there's just lots
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.760]   of gray screens, but everything loaded much faster.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.680]   And I love Click to Flash.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.960]   This is a Safari plugin that turns off Flash.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   Well, it doesn't turn off.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.160]   It just doesn't auto-load it.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.920]   You click anything if you want.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.120]   Well, and one of the things that I, you know, of course, at what Apple's saying is they
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.120]   want to make sure that you have the newest, most up-to-date Flash, not the one that would
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.920]   have been installed when the computer was configured.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.240]   I mean, that's the argument.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.520]   But of course, this is just a continuing process down the path.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.120]   Now, one of the things that's interesting is Adobe this week has announced that their
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.480]   new ad platform is going to include development tools, not just for Flash, but for HTML5.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:18.720]   So they are, it looks like the cracks are, as Flash as a distribution model are continuing
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   to grow.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.360]   Well, it's interesting to see that Apple is also deprecating Java.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.400]   They're not going to be shipping it with...
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.560]   They're basically deprecating anything that's third-party.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:30.360]   And their argument is the same thing, is that Oracle's going to be putting out new versions
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   of Java.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.120]   If you are a Java person, you should be downloading the latest from Oracle, not from us.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.480]   And there are big problems with Java.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.520]   There's actually some serious security with both Flash and Java security issues, so I
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.520]   can understand what Apple might say.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.680]   Why do the Apple just say we don't want to deal with it?
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:50.360]   And yeah, I mean, as you said, in the past, we've upgraded OS X and it's downgraded Flash.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.120]   So just let Adobe handle it.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.320]   Let Sun handle it.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.320]   Why should we be doing that?
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:00.080]   Well, I think one of the things that's going to be a challenge, though, is that as soon
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.320]   as you start making people download something separately, they stop downloading it.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:08.480]   I mean, a huge percentage of people just go, "I don't really know if I really want that."
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.200]   And then they start deciding, making that decision.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.960]   When it stops becoming automatic, you stop losing the ubiquity that you had before.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.960]   And I think the problem for a lot of advertisers is that the Mac platform is a very affluent
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.960]   platform.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.840]   It's not one that they necessarily want to give up.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.400]   And so the fact that it isn't on every Mac over time is going to have a big impact on
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.400]   advertising.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:35.280]   So I'm told by the chatroom that the trick, the fix, is to install the older version of
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.120]   Skype first, Skype 2.7.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.120]   Interesting.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:43.720]   And then upgrade to Skype 2.8.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.840]   I have to say this sounds related in the sense that maybe there are some stuff that Apple's
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:53.080]   not bundling anymore with OS X that Skype assumed would be there.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.200]   The older version of Skype would put it in, the newer version of Skype doesn't.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.280]   Is that, Aaron, that sounds like what's going on?
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.280]   I really don't know.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:06.800]   Well, I don't know where I'm going to get 2.7.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.880]   Interesting.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.240]   So Knox Harrington's reporting our chatroom that his MacBook Pro isn't signing in either
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.520]   to Skype.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.680]   So maybe Skype's got a problem.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.120]   I won't make any judgments, any snap judgments.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.520]   I'll read it for a second, so it's a service problem too.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.520]   It's a Skype problem.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.520]   Not a Mac.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.520]   Okay.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.920]   Oh, moving.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.640]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.840]   Scott's mic says you can get iDOS at apptracker.org.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:38.000]   Of course, you'll have to jailbreak to get DOS on your iPad.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.120]   Well, actually, see, I'm sorry I've been so distracted, but like while searching for
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:47.360]   it, I found an app from, I'll save my pick of a week maybe.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.960]   It's almost as, I'm sorry.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960]   You're going to interesting.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.520]   I'm not going to look at the iPad anymore.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.120]   I'm too distracted by this.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:59.520]   If you have visited lately the Apple store, according to boy Genius report, you can order
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.800]   a white iPhone.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.720]   At least they've got a screenshot of it on a black iPhone.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:11.160]   We have it, we've checked and we don't see it, but just do, let me ask the chatroom.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:16.600]   Anybody seeing a white iPhone in the app store?
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.840]   If you do order the albino iDevice, you'll have to wait.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.840]   It's probably back ordered.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.840]   Do I?
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.480]   People really still care that much about it.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.280]   And it's after Labor Day.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.640]   That's a quite a faux pas.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.280]   Yes, you're not supposed to.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280]   Yes.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.680]   That's a good point.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.960]   We trust our Boston friends to get that strength.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.200]   Now you get lost in the snow.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.960]   Let's see.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.600]   What else here?
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.560]   Let me point out that having two colors is going to be crucial for me when I have my
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.720]   two phones at the same time.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.120]   For multitasking, you need to know.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.120]   Absolutely.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.000]   And then you can have a little shoulder case that will hold your iPad.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.720]   And then you have the two iPhones.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.880]   And then you can truly get your Geek on.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   That's all.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.880]   Correction.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:08.640]   And I don't know if we mentioned this stat on this show or on Twig, but there's a little
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:15.640]   correction to Net Nielsen's report that one third of all iPad users have never downloaded
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.640]   an app.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.640]   Did we mention that last week?
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.640]   I think you did.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:23.080]   Is it Andy and Otko who said, "Bolt Kaka?"
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.080]   I seem to remember you saying that's impossible.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.160]   It turns out it is impossible.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.160]   It is impossible.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.160]   In fact, Nielsen says, "Ow."
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.160]   If it makes me sound smart then you know.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.080]   Yeah, you knew that wasn't possible.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:38.200]   Net Nielsen said, "One third of all iPad users have never downloaded an app."
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.280]   Actually, I don't find that that hard to believe.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.920]   I don't think my mom getting a new iPad would have downloaded anything.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.760]   She'd just say, "Oh, this is nice.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.240]   This is what it does."
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:51.040]   The company now said, "The number of download virgins fewer than one in ten."
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.840]   And that was because they only had it for a day.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.840]   That's right.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.840]   They're selling so many.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.000]   10% of all iPad users are new users.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   Right.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   Of course.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.360]   I would be interested to know how many people have only gotten the Kindle app though.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.960]   I think that's sort of a required app at this point.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.960]   For us it is.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.960]   I would guess that I work properly.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.120]   I keep on wanting to use the iBooks, but there's just so many books that are on the
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   Kindle that aren't on...
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:20.000]   I mean, so many books that I want technical manuals like the iPhone development app,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.160]   like many of the other stuff on motion capture, stuff that I've been reading.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:27.160]   It's all on the Kindle and not on the iBook.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.720]   Is it harder to develop for the iBook?
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.600]   Is it not harder to develop.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.440]   It's that a lot of those technical books are being done by companies that are not ready
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.600]   to sign the iBook store and don't want to read them.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.640]   In particular, Pearson, which is actually Addison West.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.640]   That's almost everybody.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.400]   Everybody can think of has not been able to work out a deal with Apple.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.400]   And what is it?
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.480]   Do you know what the sticking point is?
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:50.800]   I believe it has to do with pricing.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.080]   During the weekend, I wasn't able to find this, but I was told that MSNBC said that
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.200]   Apple confirmed of a rise in iPhone.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.360]   Did anybody see that story?
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.000]   Maybe MSNBC put it up and took it down.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   I couldn't find it.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.840]   I have not seen anywhere where Apple confirmed it.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.760]   I don't think Apple has confirmed nothing.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:12.040]   However, AT&T has added a lot of phones to its handset to its lineup, including three
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.080]   Windows phones, which will be coming out in about a week.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:22.360]   And my anecdotal, I had to say every time I walk into an AT&T store to buy, if I want
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.040]   to buy an iPhone and I don't want to deal with a line at Apple or whatever, and I sometimes
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.520]   think of better packages of stuff you can get around the iPhone.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.440]   And I got my daughter, her iPhone, four a couple weeks ago, and I walked in and every
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.320]   time I go into the AT&T store, I'll ask them how.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.440]   Because all you see is other phones other than the iPhone.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.520]   There is no POP dedicated to the iPhone.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.520]   It's all the Motorola and it's all this and it's all that.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.640]   And I said, "So you guys spent a lot of time advertising.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:50.160]   How many people get something other than an iPhone?"
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.920]   And they said, "Well, iPhones are about eight out of ten."
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   It's just like, you know, that when they come in, they buy.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.440]   We don't have to put an end cap for iPhones.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.880]   They're going to buy one.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.880]   But it's just amazing.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.720]   They're working so hard to try to get people to buy something other than an iPhone because
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.000]   of what's going to happen.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   And they just can't seem to...
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.040]   I'm sure they want some freedom from Apple.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.800]   I mean, Apple controls so much of their future at this point.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.120]   Well, call centers at Verizon are staffing up according to a report.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:24.320]   The hiring company called Tele Performance and that's in Salt Lake City and Ryla, is that
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.480]   how you say it?
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:29.880]   In Kennesaw, Georgia are hiring at facilities around the country.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:36.000]   Ryla is advertising for 1,700 new call center positions for Verizon.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.600]   So, I mean, that might indicate some interest in something going on.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:45.280]   We're seeing the rumors this year are different from the rumors that they were like six months
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.680]   ago where six months ago it did not look as though the world was reshaping itself to
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.680]   take the form of a world in which Verizon has the iPhone.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.120]   We still don't have really hard information yet, but it is starting to look like a world
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.280]   in which Verizon is getting ready to receive the iPhone.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.920]   It does look like that.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.920]   It's got an interest zone.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.160]   It's got an interest zone.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.800]   So, I just got a Wookiee, which is not a Nuggie.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.800]   It's a Wookiee.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.640]   Griffin sent me a box of iPhone cases, all of which are Slidons, by the way.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   Oh, no, they're not.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.320]   They're all Snap-Ons, aren't they?
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.240]   Yeah, they're all Snap-Ons.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:36.720]   But they also sent me this and actually he's having a moment.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.320]   It's okay.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.760]   Something obviously entered Andy's brain when you said that.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.760]   I mentioned the word Snap-On.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.760]   And I don't know.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.760]   No, no, no, no.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.760]   It just a very funny woodchuck is outside.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.960]   Bippling out of the sleeve in a most interesting and draw away.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.600]   These are all when I say Snap-On.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.760]   What I'm trying to say is instead of sliding these onto the iPhone, you just snap them
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:05.040]   on the back of the case there like that, which eliminates that scratching thing that
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.440]   people were talking about with them.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.480]   But they also sent me a Wookiee.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.360]   You want to laugh about that too, Andy?
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.360]   This is a Wookiee.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.520]   It was unrelented to the two together.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.160]   Wookiee and Snap-On, when you imagine the two together, they got a...
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.840]   Oh, no, it's just a...
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.560]   This is a Wookiee and I'm going to give it to Alex for testing.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.600]   You know what this is?
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.280]   You get the Sesame Street digital books on your iPhone.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.480]   You slide this into the iPhone, it's got a little jack connector.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.480]   How old is Malachi?
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480]   He's almost three.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.000]   He might be too old for this.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.920]   This really looks like this is like for one year old.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.920]   But I have my...
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.760]   But Isabella is a year and a half.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.840]   Oh yeah, you have a little one.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.520]   I got two test units.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520]   You already got this?
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.520]   Oh no, the kids.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520]   Yeah, because I know...
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.000]   I got the Wookiee, but you got the kids.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.360]   So actually it says ages three and I've downloaded the free Wookiee app to see great books for
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.440]   your Wookiee.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.840]   It is a iPhone holder for babies.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.840]   Well, I'm going to give it a shot.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:01.840]   So will you even have an extract?
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.840]   I'll test it.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.840]   They can drool and whatever.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.840]   Yeah, it's got a drool.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.840]   It's got a little cup there.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.520]   But the question is, is can they really...
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   It's got batteries in there.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.840]   Can they interact with it through this plastic?
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.600]   Maybe it's not for an iPhone except it came from Griffin and it has a bunch.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.360]   Yeah, no, it's for the app store.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360]   Interesting.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360]   Okay.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.800]   So would you come back...
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.280]   I was going to do it on the daily gizwiz.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:31.040]   I need you to come back after the review and do a review for me.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040]   There it is.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.640]   There's your Wookiee.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.280]   And a bunch of beautiful Griffin cases.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   Thank you.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.600]   It appeared in the mail one day.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.600]   Wow.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.720]   It's like it must shake or something too.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.720]   I think it does something.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.720]   Okay.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.720]   Yeah, no, no, I'll test it.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.720]   I think you...
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.720]   We'll test it on two different age groups.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.720]   One and a half and three.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.720]   Perfect.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.720]   That's what I have a video.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.720]   So I think Malachi has way too sophisticated because he's already using an iPhone.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.720]   Well, what I like about it is just that it's padded.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.120]   Malachi, so Malachi, if he gets ahold of your iPhone, the problem is that he's developed
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.360]   a technique that he's found very effective.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:05.280]   If we tell him, give my iPhone back, he stares at you flatly, flat face, and just takes your
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.280]   iPhone and throws it at you.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.280]   He doesn't...
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.040]   There's no grimace or something.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.040]   He just goes, "Damn!"
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.200]   He just throws it at you.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:18.320]   And evidently, he has quickly learned that we won't ask for the iPhone back.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:25.040]   It's like, "My son showed me a YouTube video of a two-year-old in Indonesia who smokes
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.680]   two packs a day."
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.680]   And it's the same thing.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:31.680]   They said, "Well, we can't ween him off of it because he really hurt us."
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.160]   If you take away the sick...
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.800]   He doesn't react, he just looks at you and just goes, "I'm going to throw it at you now."
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.200]   And that has definitely decreased the number of times we asked for in the bank.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:44.400]   A couple of more quick stories here.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.280]   Apple's offering free iPad engraving for the holidays, which I think is a good idea.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.760]   I wish that had gotten this engraved because I know that people are going to steal my
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.760]   air.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:57.360]   The minute I turn my back, Ken Shebertson is going to sneak in here and he's sitting,
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.360]   he's waiting.
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.440]   He's sitting out there waiting to take it.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.640]   It is the ninth anniversary of the iPod.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640]   Wow.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.640]   You see?
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   I told you.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.640]   He's right there.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.640]   Look at that.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.640]   I remember back in the day when there was no iPod.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.040]   October 23, 2001.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.040]   I remember that day vividly.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.360]   I was working at Tech TV.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.960]   Jim Lauterback went to an Apple event.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.320]   I wasn't invited then either.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   Not that you're bitter.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.880]   Not that I'm bitter.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.000]   And he came, but I have to say, he came back with this.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.280]   I have it in the back of my closet here.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.920]   The original five gigabyte iPod.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:40.480]   Now nine years old, it's almost as old as a young child, but it feels like it's ancient
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:41.480]   history.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.480]   Look at that.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.480]   Doesn't that feel like it's ancient history?
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.480]   Man, it's got the old pick.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:45.480]   It's got the fire wire.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.880]   The mechanical wheel is just still the mechanical click wheel.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.520]   And remember the shock that it didn't have an FM radio.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.520]   No radio.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.520]   Oh my goodness.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.520]   Look at how big it is.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.960]   It has got the fire wire.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.640]   How are you?
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.640]   The big deal for me was that, wait a minute, iPod means nothing.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.040]   And they're telling me this is a music player, but where's the big button that's marked play
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.280]   and the fast forward and the re-run button?
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.280]   That's right.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.160]   It's like you're just building a device to make product.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:20.360]   It's like, you go to the generic aisle in the grocery store where it's just called product.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.200]   Look how thick that is.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:26.800]   So according to the unofficial Apple web blog, the name iPod was first proposed to Apple
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.000]   by copywriter Vinny Chico.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.200]   Hey, I'm Vinny who thought of the phrase, open the pod bay door how open the pod bay
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:41.720]   door how when he first saw the all white prototype of the original device.
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:45.200]   Checo thought the relationship between the media player and a personal computer was similar
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.840]   to the small space pods in the movie 2001 and the large discovery mothership.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.680]   I don't know if that's apocryphal, but it's a great story anyway.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.160]   I love that.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.480]   That's my story, Leo.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.480]   It is.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.080]   Yeah, that was I talked to Vinny.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.280]   Oh, all right.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.760]   Well, I apologize for giving TUAW the credit on that.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.720]   They didn't credit you in their article.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.720]   They didn't?
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.720]   No.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.720]   The blower.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.720]   So tell me the story.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.280]   You talked how who is this guy Vinny?
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.280]   He's a copywriter.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.800]   He's been working for Apple for years.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.360]   So he was an Apple employee.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   Okay.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.960]   No, he was a he's a freelancer.
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:29.800]   He's an outside contractor, but he was working with jobs on this jobs was working on the
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.800]   name.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.320]   The same time he was working, you know, on the hardware and the software, the packaging.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.320]   Right.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.720]   And he was locked in a secret room up on the the fifth floor or the fourth floor, one of
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:42.040]   their buildings.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:45.560]   And they, you know, they were working on the name and the packaging in there as part
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.120]   of their graphics department.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.080]   So were you interviewing him for cult of Macintosh or the website or?
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.560]   No, this is back at Wired.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.960]   I did a story about the birth of the iPod.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.640]   I got to talk to John, John Rubenstein, jobs, his hardware guy.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   Right.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.400]   Who's now, of course, an Android guy.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   Right.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.040]   So he had, you know, he when he quit Apple, he had a non-compete agreement.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.560]   So he had a year twiddling his thumbs.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.840]   He had nothing better to do than speak to reporters.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.200]   He taught to me about the birth of the iPod and then I got hold of Vinny Chieko and a couple
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.280]   of others and did a story about how they put it together for Wired.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.720]   Well, tell us a little bit about that.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.720]   Cause here we are.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.920]   It was October 21st, 2001 that Apple had that event that, actually October 23rd.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.760]   So it was three days ago.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.520]   It was ninth birthday.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.640]   Why was that the first iDevice?
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:43.360]   Well, they were looking at doing video cameras or digital cameras.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.280]   Anything to compliment their iLife suite of software jobs.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.320]   You know, when they were trying to make, you know, iMovie, they got a whole bunch of
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320]   video cameras in.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   They got a whole bunch of digital cameras.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320]   Sorry, let me correct myself.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.560]   John Rubenstein was with Palm.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.160]   He did WebOS and now at HP.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160]   Right.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.160]   Correct myself.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.000]   He was a CEO of Palm.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.240]   So there was an iMac.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.240]   Wasn't there?
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240]   The iMacs came out in '98.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.640]   So I guess they did have i stuff.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.400]   So the blood was the insight that Vinny had.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.880]   Well, it's something else.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.680]   Vinny wouldn't tell me what it was though.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.600]   But apparently it was horrible.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.160]   It was, it'll make your blood care.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.160]   It's probably iPad.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.160]   Right?
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.160]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.160]   Would it be surprising?
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.920]   It would have been rougher at that size with that form factor.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:34.920]   Well, maybe it really would be.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:35.920]   I'm coming to think of it.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.160]   It would have been market confusion.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.880]   I remember though, I mean, remember this was not the first MP3 player, but, but, and
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.960]   Apple didn't even do the software for this, did they?
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   No, they bought it.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:52.320]   Well, they bought the, you know, the basic operating system for, from another company.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.320]   But they did the UI.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.320]   Right.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320]   That was the important part.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.160]   You know, this is the first usable one.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:01.160]   And the big part of the Magic Accourses was its connection to iTunes.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.600]   You know, you plugged it in.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.240]   It sucked all your music onto it automatically.
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:07.320]   There was no, you didn't have to, you know, make any choices whatsoever.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.840]   I remember somebody saying how impressed you that, that what he really realized.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.840]   That Apple was a genius of design.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.080]   I wish I could remember who this was.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:22.080]   It said this when he realized that Apple had put a separate speaker into the iPod just
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.600]   so that the click wheel would click.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.600]   Right.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.400]   They put a whole speaker just for that UI piece.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:33.080]   And it was such a minor thing because it was such a soft little sound, but, you know,
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:38.840]   that it is so, I mean, I am getting so clear of how important feedback is with our own applications
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.840]   that we make for deep garage is that if there's any kind of hold up or you don't know where
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.840]   it is, it creates stress.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.880]   You know, you know, you know, it just is this low line stress that I don't know what's happening
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:48.880]   right now.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:49.880]   I don't know if it's broken.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:50.880]   I don't know if it's working.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:51.880]   I don't know why it's doing this.
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.160]   And that is probably the thing that bothers me the most about applications I realized is
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.560]   just a lack of feedback.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.400]   And then the user doesn't know whether to do it again.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.400]   Right.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   It's like, I guess I should try it again.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   Exactly.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.400]   Just a little click is all it takes.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.400]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:23.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   I'm really happy to see you.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.400]   I'm really happy to see you.

[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:23.400]   .com for that multimedia guild of artists who are living, working, and well, they're not living together.
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400]   No, no, no.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:28.400]   They're working together, though, and training together, and all over the world.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.400]   I bet you that there's a few Pixel Corp people in the Big Nerd Ranch.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:32.400]   Of course you're doing.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:33.400]   I think probably.
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:34.400]   We have five people.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:36.400]   Yeah, wow, that's all of them seem brilliant.
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:38.400]   Aaron Hillagas is from Big Nerd Ranch.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.400]   Let me put it in the little plug.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:44.400]   We do training, consulting, and we also publish books on iPhone, Mac, and Android.
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.400]   It's just great.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.400]   Everybody does it.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.400]   Loves Big Nerd Ranch, and they wear cowboys, even though they're in Baltimore.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.400]   Where are you?
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:52.400]   We're in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:53.400]   Atlanta.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.400]   I guess you could wear cowboy hats in Atlanta.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:55.400]   Sure.
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:56.400]   Why not?
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.800]   Leander, Kenny, I'm so glad you were here today.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:01.400]   I am just such a big fan of the Cult of Mac.
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.920]   CultofMac.com is the website.
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:08.200]   There's a great coffee table book, too, for people who love Macs called Cult of Mac.
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:10.400]   Anything you want to plug today, Leander?
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:14.480]   Well, you know, I have a more recent book, "Inside Stee's Brain," but that was a couple
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:15.480]   of years ago.
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:19.280]   That's the one that got banned from Apple stores everywhere.
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:20.960]   Oh, no, I wish.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:25.880]   That was the book from my book, so that got my book spanned as well.
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:26.880]   Oh, that's right.
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:27.880]   That's right.
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:29.520]   Well, Leander, it's so nice to have you.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:30.520]   Thank you for joining us today.
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.440]   CultofMac.com is the website.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.960]   Andy Inaco, of course, we all know and love.
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:40.000]   Is it the Chicago Sun Times and his website www.cwob.com.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000]   You can watch us do this show.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.920]   We do it live every Tuesday at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time, 1800 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:52.960]   You can join us in the chat room, irc.twit.tv and be the kids in the back of the class making
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:54.280]   wise-acre comments.
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:57.400]   I've gotten so hooked on the Twit app, by the way.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:59.360]   We should give a plug for that.
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.960]   I just realized how much I listened to it.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:05.400]   I realized that I was falling behind.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.680]   I realized that how do I do this?
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:09.640]   I started playing it and just the audio in the background when I'm driving, when I'm
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:11.560]   doing all the stuff.
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:14.280]   It just works really, really well.
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:15.840]   I don't know who developed it, but it was a--
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:16.840]   Craig Mulaney.
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:17.840]   Yeah, shiftkeyssoftware.com.
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.840]   It's well done.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:19.840]   It's easy to use.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:22.600]   There's a free version for the iPhone.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:25.160]   I told them, charge $0.99 for the iPad version.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:27.080]   Make a little money on this.
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.080]   It's really great.
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:32.520]   If you're listening to the show, you should have it.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.280]   You can get it and you can watch live.
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:37.560]   You can chat with it and you can download existing shows.
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:38.560]   All the tools are just--
[01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:39.560]   It even has a-- you can call the radio show.
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:42.560]   I think the radio show phone number is built in one button.
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:44.960]   One button call the radio show.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:45.960]   Thank you for that.
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:49.400]   I always forget to give Craig some props because he did such a nice job.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.720]   Really, really great.
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:52.720]   It's well done.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:54.520]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:55.520]   Thanks for joining us now.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:58.200]   You better get back to work because break time is over.
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:01.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:04.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
