[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.500]   Joining us from his clean shaven layer in beautiful
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.500]   Boston where there's about 18 feet of snow.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500]   I've shoveled all but the last three.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500]   You get a big storm?
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500]   Yeah, and it really was one of those groundhog days
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500]   moments where I woke up on Sunday morning and
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.500]   did some email, did some stuff before I finally
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500]   actually got out of the bedroom and went to an open
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.500]   window and said, "Wait a minute.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.500]   There's not supposed to be snow here.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500]   I was riding my bike three days."
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   I didn't order this.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.500]   Who signed for this?
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500]   And then I had some stuff to do Monday morning
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   and I'm being like this big 12-18 inch big big big
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500]   all day long blow.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.500]   The good thing is that I do, in England, you do feel
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   a little bit more secure with some snow in the ground,
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500]   which is why I left a few inches on the driveway
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   because that way you know when there have been
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   trespassers and interlopers and near-do-wells
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   hanging around your house.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   Yes.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   You know whether to--
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   See the footprints.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   Exactly.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   When I pass by the driveway coming back from
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   Aaron, I know that, okay, let's get the sock full
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   of nickels out of the glove box because there might be
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   people in wait.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   He's in near-do-well.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   Speaking of near-do-wells, it'll lopers.

[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   I'm sorry Las Vegas.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   Almost the same.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   I knew there was a loss in there somewhere.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   Hey, you're there for the big photo marketing
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   association camera show?
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   I am.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   And there are lots of people here with me.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.500]   Did it just start as a--
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   Can you report?
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   Well, yesterday was the press event and some conference
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   sessions.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   Today the trade show floor opened and there were lots
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   more press announcements.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.500]   The big story here is what they're calling hybrid
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   cameras.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   Cameras that aren't quite DSLRs but more advanced
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   than Compax.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   And some software stuff for the Mac has been released.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.500]   But it's no real super duper big camera news.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   No new D400.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   No--
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   We had more than enough in the last few last year to--
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   This is the fifth major photo trade show just since October.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.500]   So there is that.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   Yeah, we don't-- no more.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.500]   Enough.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   No.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   And we're done until October now.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   Good.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.500]   Also with us in studio today, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   Hey, Alex.

[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   Good to see you too from the Pixel Core.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   Alex spends a lot of time in studio now.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   You were here yesterday doing this week in media.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   I had so much fun.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500]   You sat on the ball and did the switching and the whole thing.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   Yeah, I have to admit, I'm much more impressed with your
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   switching after I tried to do it myself.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   Oh, come on.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.500]   You were doing a great job.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   I had a lot of fun with it, but it is quite a ADD process of hosting.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500]   And then figuring out what lower third to go next.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   And then making sure that you're not-- like I left it on Daisy,
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   I think, for a little while, just not.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   That's fine.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.500]   You know, everyone's fine.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.500]   I do that too.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   That's fine.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.500]   It was a lot of fun though.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   Wait, you sat on the ball.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   You sat on the ball.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   I bounced on the ball.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   I couldn't help but wanting to bounce all the time.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   That's why I have the ball.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   It makes you bouncy.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.500]   It's like a ticker thing.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.500]   It gives me more energy, I have to say.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   Scott, go ahead.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   Scott's not such a hot-- what are you staying at the Motel 6?
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.500]   Not such a hot Wi-Fi connection, so we're going to have to be patient with him.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   Were you staying with him, Scott?
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   You see?
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   As we were staying.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   Oh, it's just like what they say.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   They know that--
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   There we go.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   I don't know what's going on, but it sounds very robotic.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   Well, Scott, if you recently had a tracheotomy, you were coming through great.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   Yes.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   That's such a compress well.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.500]   So I ordered-- I was very excited.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   You know, we're moving to a new streaming system and it's a higher end streaming system
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.500]   for our live video and requires a big old computer.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.500]   A B-O-C to run the thing.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   So Saturday, I ordered a wonderful Mac Pro top of the line, three gigahertz.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   And a clockwork.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   And a clockwork.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   What happened was, there's someone at Apple that's actually-- they're keyed up to you
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   and they're just watching it and then they go, we've got an order.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   We've got an order.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.500]   Release the high.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   I don't understand.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   I haven't bought a Mac Pro in years.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   I buy one Mac Pro.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   And by the way, you know, David Chardier from Mars Technica said, well, you ought to know
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   better, Leo, you don't buy when there's rumors flying.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   But it was Mac mini rumors.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   I hadn't heard a thing about it.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   You had to push it forward.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   The thing is, you had to order or we would have never seen it.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.500]   I mean, if you had done this in December, we would have seen it on the--
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   On the X-Lacks of Macintosh computers, that's what you're saying.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   All right.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   So-- but I-- well, I'm going to need all your help because I'm still conflicted.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.000]   Now, the good news is Apple, because I ordered so close to a release, Apple actually held
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.300]   the order and then I got an email today that says, could you call us so they haven't shipped
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.300]   it?
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.620]   So obviously, I can upgrade or get the different one.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.300]   But I have some-- I have-- I'm a quandary and I'm going to need your guys help because
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.500]   it doesn't look like I should.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.460]   It looks like I'd be better off with the old Mac Pro.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.740]   Is this new Mac Pro an upgrade?
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.740]   That's my question.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.900]   We're also going to talk about the Mac mini.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.700]   A lot of perturbance, if that's a word, perturbations over the price point on the Mac mini.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.700]   A little disappointing.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.700]   No drop in price there and not much improvement in performance.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.000]   Also, new iMacs.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.100]   And I can't-- I don't even know what's different than new iMacs.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.900]   I'm wondering what's going on in Apple.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.100]   We're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.700]   We also have other news stories.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:00.200]   But I want to welcome a new advertiser to the fold just in the nick of time.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.700]   I'm thinking of moving all my sites there.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.500]   Everything's down as I speak.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   LeoVille.com is down.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   Twit is down.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.300]   I'm thinking I should have been on Squarespace.
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.300]   It's like the V8 thing.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.300]   I should have had a Squarespace.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.900]   What a-- so Squarespace, I had never heard of Squarespace.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.900]   Have you heard of--
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.800]   Yeah, it was actually something that when we were first-- when Scott and I were talking
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.300]   about Twit photo, I started playing with Squarespace.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.300]   Now Scott had some great people to do WordPress.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.800]   And so that made sense for Twit.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.200]   I spent a good couple days digging through it and building pieces.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   And what was great was that I could just throw widgets in.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   I didn't have to know any of my programming.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   And I could lay it out.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.600]   I could change-- you know, had a bunch of templates.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   But more importantly, I didn't need to know any code to just simply move things around
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.300]   and re-stack them and everything else.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.300]   It was pretty amazing.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.200]   It's not just a blog, by the way.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   There's a blog module which, by the way, has full import and-- and I love this-- export
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.400]   for WordPress, Blogger, Moveable Type, and Type Hat.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.200]   So you go-- your data is completely portable.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.500]   So if you've got a WordPress blog, boom, you move it over in a second.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.600]   But it also has forums.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.800]   It has photo galleries.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.400]   It has a form builder.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.200]   Support for Google Maps.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.400]   Permission access so you can have multiple editors if you should choose.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.600]   Great website tracking, a built-in search engine optimizer.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.000]   You know, it does it all.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And they're using a very sophisticated Java virtualization system that allows
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.400]   them to throw a band with that at everybody benefits.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.800]   It's just a really-- this is-- if you sat back and said, "I'm going to start
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.000]   signing something from scratch," knowing what we know now about the modern internet,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   this is what you would do.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Squarespace.com.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.400]   Sarah Lane is on Squarespace.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.800]   Kevin Rose is on Squarespace.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.000]   That kind of wooed me.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.800]   I thought, "Wow."
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   So we're moving our corporate blog over there.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   I'm thinking now, I'm moving every darn sight I got because it would be up.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.600]   They would be up right now.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   Squarespace.com/MacBreak.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.200]   You can get 10% off your new account.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   And by the way, you do get a free trial, a 14-day trial for free.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:09.000]   But if you sign up, then you get 10% off when you go to squarespace.com/MacBreak.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.600]   You're going to hear more about Squarespace over the next few weeks on MacBreak and some of our other shows.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.000]   I'm very impressed.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.800]   Nice guys too.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.000]   I talked to them and I was blown away.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   So we're moving everything over.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.200]   I can't wait.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   Hey, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   You're done.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   You're done rolling your own.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   You know, I come and go, you know, because for a long time, I really thought, "I have to
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   run all my own servers.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.800]   I need root access.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   I install the software.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.000]   I run it."
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.560]   And we had a kind of a come to Jesus moment when I lost all the data about what was that
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.560]   six months ago?
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.320]   We got first we got hacked and then a raid array crashed.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.320]   The card crashed.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   See, I thought raid five, but you can't lose data.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.920]   If the card crashes, you lose data.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.120]   So the card died.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.600]   If it's crossing over two separate groups, yeah.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.600]   Absolutely.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   It was a bad system.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.800]   So then I thought, "Well, okay, obviously I've been outmatched.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   I need a sysadmin."
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.080]   Now I'm thinking, "I just need somebody to run the whole part."
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.840]   This is really the future of software as a service.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.760]   I mean, the idea that you are, whether because they have to make that all bulletproof, you
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   know, to keep on growing and just allowing them to--
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.120]   This software as a service, you're exactly right.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.120]   And then the source does.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.440]   It's what all these other ones do.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.760]   And it's like S3 and all of that stuff.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.760]   It's in the cloud.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.720]   And they're worried about stability.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.360]   I thought, "Oh, I have dedicated servers."
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.440]   I thought, "Oh, that's the way to do it.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   I have dedicated servers.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.440]   I have my own.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.960]   I don't have to worry about anybody else."
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.120]   But it turns out that also is a fail point.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.920]   That's really because we have a dedicated server.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.720]   We have everything's failed now on this one server.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.560]   I have three of them, but this one.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.960]   So now the way to do it is clearly load balance across multiple servers.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   You completely redone it.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.960]   That's someone else handling it.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.620]   network operation centers. This is how they do it. I like it. All right. Let's talk about
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:00.280]   the new max, and I have some real questions about this new Mac Pro. So the biggest shift
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:06.340]   here is they've moved to the Nahalom platform, which is Intel's eye seven processed in the
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:14.420]   Halem mean, anyone? You're your the Halaam, it's not what you know, it's not what you
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:23.700]   know, even after rivers. I'm sure it's some geographic thing. Means it's an old problem.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.540]   We're running out of things that haven't been trademarked. Architecture is named after
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:32.860]   Nahalom River in Northwest Oregon River. Nahalom Native Native American tribe in Oregon.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:40.380]   It means in Wapunog, it means best processor ever. Ever, ever. Actually, it's a very cool
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:48.140]   processor has some neat features. It is there are true four cores on a processor. They are
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:53.380]   there's a memory architecture is built in. There's no Northbridge anymore. It's all taken
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.380]   into the processor, which in theory would mean everything's faster because it's on the die.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.740]   Well, and this has been a big issue is that this has been a big issue for computers for
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.020]   quite some time. I mean, Max especially is that it doesn't matter how fast the we're
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:12.380]   not pegging the processors with big process like especially when you're getting high bottle
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.820]   that say you're pressing video. You're not really going to peg the processors because
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.060]   it's not the processors that are slowing things down. It's the disk space and it's the memory
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.420]   architecture or disk speed and memory architecture that's really making a difference.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:35.300]   Yeah, I go to store.apple.com. So, okay, the machine I ordered for $4,299 was a it was
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:42.260]   a the old Xeon quad core Xeon dual quad course. It was eight cores at three gigahertz with
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:48.900]   four gigs of RAM. They don't go to three gigahertz anymore. That now the baseline is what is it
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:58.940]   2.6 or two and then there's a 2.8 or 2.93. So, they've lowered the clock speeds and they're
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.300]   charging more for that, aren't they? Yeah, I would be paying 400 bucks more for a lower
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.860]   clock speed. And I think where you might see the speed or performance increased to balance
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:13.500]   that out is like you were saying Leo, the bus speeds are going to. Well, and here's the
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:25.060]   thing and we should get Ryan Shroud off. So, this is it. The baseline is 2.26 gigahertz
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:32.900]   quad core Xeon. Actually, you can get a single core but 2.26 quad core Xeon. Then you can
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:44.220]   that add for that's by the way, 3299. Add $1400. You go to 266. For 0.4 gigahertz increase,
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:50.660]   fourteen hundred bucks add 2,600 bucks. You get 2.93 gigahertz. Now, you did it does the
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:57.580]   baseline now has six gigs of RAM as opposed to two or four, I guess. But, you know, I
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.580]   have noticed one thing about the I haven't been to the Apple store for a little while
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.420]   is that the memory is actually not that expensive as far as, you know, it used to be one of those
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.020]   things that we would always buy them by the memory separately. We wouldn't buy it from
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.060]   Apple because it was just too expensive. Well, yeah. And it's actually. You have to buy
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.420]   six gigs of Apple RAM. Now, one thing about in the halo about I7 is you add RAM and threes,
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.420]   not twos anymore. The interleaving is in threes. So, you'll want six, they offer eight, which
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:29.100]   is a mistake. You want multiples of three for the Sims. So, I would go for the 12.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.620]   Probably want to go for the 12. It's only 300 bucks more, which is that's pretty comparable
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:38.360]   to third party, isn't it? It is the hard drives are not comparable. One terabyte hard drive
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.220]   for 300 bucks for it. So, get it. I mean, so, you get a minimum hard drive. It's Amazon
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:47.020]   for 130 bucks and that's the black. I mean, that's the caviar blacks. This is for four
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.300]   drive base. So, get one loaded and put one. And I highly suggest if you're buying a Mac
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:56.340]   Pro, we do this with all the machines. We put we've been putting the ATI card in it.
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:02.980]   We minute a minimum machine at our in our office, we have about four or five Mac Pros is we we
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:09.340]   run them up to 10, 10 gigs minimum. We we put a faster graphics processor in although
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.580]   these new graphics processors look pretty good. But then we also put we put three raw
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:20.100]   drives in in your in the in the empty bays and we raid those zero and we call it scary
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.260]   raid to remind us that you know, you shouldn't leave stuff there. But when you're using those
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.260]   as a as a scratch disc and a work disc, those are running about 300 megabytes a second.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.740]   And it in it if you're if you need a Mac Pro, it means that you're doing heavy work. And
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.580]   if you're doing heavy work, having that scratch drive that is really able to move that data
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:43.060]   quickly and having enough RAM to handle it. I think combined with this new memory architecture,
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:48.620]   it really is a very cheap way to speed up your processes. I know our production guys
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.380]   go to another machine that doesn't have the raids built in and they just feel like they're
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.500]   you know, we're in a molasses. Yeah. Well, these are better video cards, finally. There's
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:03.060]   a minimum configuration is 512 megs of VRAM. It's quite a thing. But these aren't the top
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.260]   of the line. Once again, Apple for some reason, but here's the thing about that is, you know,
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:12.540]   I actually talked to someone that used to be at a large videographics company that may
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.580]   or may not be supplying Apple. Yes. And one of the things they pointed out is that there
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:24.100]   is not much of a performance difference between the pro cards and the consumer cards. There
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:29.580]   is that they guarantee them. You know, and so well, thank you. Well, they say that these
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.260]   ones with these ones will work because you these your your your they guarantee that they're
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.980]   not going to have, you know, that Nvidia, you know, Nvidia or ATI makes them. They
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.020]   guarantee that they're going to be a certain level of quality. Whereas these other ones
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:47.420]   are oftentimes made by third party manufacturers, but the reality is on a day to day basis,
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.780]   they're very, very close. I don't think it's after talking to them, I realized I don't
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:56.540]   really think it's worth spending more than what you get more than about $500 on a video
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.660]   card right now. Unless you have a very specialized application or your gamer, it's there are
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.780]   no Mac gamers, but I'm saying it's not. Well, yeah, I mean, we have creative apps. We do
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.580]   stuff with the computer. Well, but all these creative apps are GPU enabled now. Yeah. And
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.540]   so that's why the quality of the GPU becomes more important. These are not anywhere near
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.460]   the state of the other GT 120 or the the they say for a little more performance, the radio
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:26.700]   HD 4870. Come on. And I got to point something out. Okay. Now I'm going to talk about, you
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:32.140]   know, yes, because of QPI because all this stuff is on the chip on paper, I seven is
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:37.100]   much faster. But but it depends on your application. If your application doesn't take advantage
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.500]   of eight cores, if it's very CPU bound, in, in there are cases where three gigahertz is
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.460]   better than 2.6 gigahertz, regardless of QPI and onboard memory management and all
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.580]   that crap. Absolutely. You're absolutely right. And there was so that what people should be
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.300]   looking at is what are they going to be doing with it? And will the applications they use
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.660]   take advantage of this very expensive hardware? Well, but I think if you're buying that expensive
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.740]   our hardware, most of our most of our hardware, for instance, when we're doing we do compression
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.740]   now with episode pro, which is a very expensive version of compressor. And when we turn that
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:14.020]   thing on, it lights up all eight cores, almost to the max sodas, Moto and cinema 4d and,
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.940]   you know, you know, a lot of these applications have got, you know, are being written with
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.140]   multi threading, especially it for the people who are buying Mac pros.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.980]   Right. I have to, you know, what I have to do is call bit gravity, which is the people
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:33.100]   who wrote the software that's going to do the streaming and say and ask them, you know,
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.660]   and they may not even know, but maybe, you know, there are, there are applications that
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.060]   are, they only do two threads. But I think that's a chicken or egg thing. If Apple really
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.020]   pushes this, you know, that you're going to get everybody's going to have everybody
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.740]   mean, all the PCs are going to handle them also. Right. You know, the handle does something
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:52.340]   very cool. It overclocks itself. So it knows you have a ridiculous number of processors.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:57.860]   It knows you've got, you know, eight processors, four per core. And so what happens if you're
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:03.420]   not, it watches what's going on, if a couple of the processors are idle, it boosts the
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:09.100]   clock speed of the working processors. So it, it, but not a huge amount, but you probably
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.940]   are going over three gigahertz on the top of the line. Right. If you're not using all
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.740]   the cores, that's, but what happens though, this makes it very hard for consumers to
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:21.340]   figure out what the hell they're getting. Why this turbo mode means well, as it, I don't
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.540]   know, is it is my application going to benefit from this? I think we need to, I think, you
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.220]   know, what we're going to see very quickly is a lot of tests using Photoshop, using
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:36.300]   3D applications, using probably the max on, you know, has a great way to test it for 3D,
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.220]   you know, a variety of these different tests to see. And I think you're going to have to
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:45.780]   see in your segment, whether it makes it makes a difference. Andy, are you a, I think
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:53.940]   I think we only know about one tenth of what Scott thinks because we only hear, I just
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:59.140]   stopped off because I realized you didn't hear me. Go ahead, speak. I just, you know,
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.460]   I think you hit it on the head though. Most of these things coming out, lately do take
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:09.780]   advantage of, of, you know, the GPU. I mean, all the, you know, Photoshop, aperture, all
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.580]   the photo applications, most of the video applications, even the plugins that are being
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:20.140]   written for them are being optimized, you know, using OpenGL and things like that. So I think
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.620]   it'll be less of a concern that you need the gigahertz.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:30.020]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're only doing one thing with this machine. My inclination, by
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.020]   the way, is to buy a refurbished version of the old one at the higher clock speed. But
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.980]   again, you have to ask the developer. Yeah, you have to say tests or do, well, I can't
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.820]   afford to do tests. I just need a machine that works. You mean like get to? No, no,
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.420]   I mean, let's see which one works faster. Apple needs to lend us one for a week. I
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.260]   can't, I don't do those kinds of things. I feel that that compromise to lend it to you
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:59.500]   for a week for tests and then send it back. I guess it's, you're so, I mean, two different
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.780]   camps, right? Okay. So if I'm a technology guy testing technology for streaming video,
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:09.460]   of course, if I'm a Mac journalist covering Apple products, then it's another issue.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.540]   Well, but it doesn't make sense to, it doesn't make sense to buy everything that comes out
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.740]   just to test it. Because you're going to say, no, that's why I'm not testing it. I think,
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:22.060]   I think, no, I think Leo's point is that if he's getting it as someone who talks about
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.380]   technology to a wide audience to advise them on the best, on the ins and outs of a person
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.700]   seek, so of a certain piece of hardware, then that's okay. If he's getting alone, because
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.940]   he's thinking about buying one, but doesn't want to buy the wrong one. I mean, that's,
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.620]   that's the sort of thing that I face like on a weekly basis, something that's probably
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.820]   going to be a pick of the week next week of the week after was something that, something
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:46.300]   that I sort of need for, for a certain job that I'm doing. And I didn't know if it would
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.760]   work or not, but I realized that no, I know they would send me one for free, but I have
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.540]   no intention right now about writing about it. And I can't on that basis, I really do
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:59.100]   have to stick a curve bar in my wallet and buy it. I just can't bless you, Leo, you're
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.020]   your strength is at the strength of 10 men because you're so pure.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:09.460]   My soul is not so pure. I'm thinking impure thoughts right now. I've lusted my heart
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.820]   from Mac Pro. I know, I know. I think I'm going to get some. So I'll get, I really do
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.420]   want to, I mean, they look great, but I do do, I guess the question is, it's the pro,
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.700]   right? So anybody who's using pro apps is going to be, it's going to work better, right?
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.140]   Because Apple's in control of that, they're going to write to the I7, right? Adobe's going
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.100]   to write to the I7. Yeah. Even though they only make a 32 bit version for Apple.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:38.660]   Now, isn't it, isn't it different how to try to, trying to digest all the specs of these
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:43.900]   Mac Pro designs as opposed to an iMac? Because they're really not designed to be understood
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.980]   by a regular consumer. They're designed so that someone who's in the process of buying
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:53.420]   10 to 20 on a really big production basis, they're not going to look at the specs. They're
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.260]   going to look at, well, how does it work in this specific application? Where is the bottleneck?
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.220]   And I can't see here in this one page, right?
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.180]   I think what I'm going to do is spend 400 bucks more and get the middle one. It's always
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:10.100]   best to get the middle one. I get the middle. The 2.66. That's $1,400 more, by the way.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.020]   Well, it's, you know, but it's $400 more than the Mac that I had ordered, the Mac Pro
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:19.460]   I had ordered, I'd ordered a three gigahertz with four gigs of RAM and a better video card.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.540]   And I'm getting a better video card. I'm getting more RAM. And you know, the I7 is
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.980]   a little RAM. You're getting six gigs of RAM. I think six is, look it. I'm only running
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.900]   one application on this machine ever. It's going to sit in the closet. This is the big
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.780]   gravity machine is going to sit in the closet and just stream video. But I want the video
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.500]   to look as good as it can. Of course, if my website down doesn't really matter.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:45.780]   So that's another, you know, I think it's overkill for that. It might be.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.820]   Well, I asked big gravity. They said, get eight way and get as much RAM as you, you know,
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.820]   they said, throw horsepower at it. They said it'll be enough for our existing applications,
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:59.300]   but you know, there's things we want to do. For instance, you know, they have that multiple.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.900]   Have you seen that? Brian Shaler wrote it. In fact, I was going to get them on the show.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.380]   It's the they have if you go to bit gravity dot com slash interactive,
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.780]   you can we can have all five cameras at once. And then the viewer decides which one they want
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.940]   to look at in the big window. That's pretty cool. Yeah, they could be. Yeah, we have a lot
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.420]   of ins what telling shoe mikers. Yeah, they'd all be looking at you. They all be looking at NOCO.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.780]   That's that's that's how we'll divvy up like the revenue free show. Yeah, well, yeah, we can track
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:30.180]   that. That's a good idea. How much camera time did you get? How much time did you get in the big box?
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:36.980]   That's a great idea. All right. So that's the Mac Pro done. Anything else anybody wants to say?
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.780]   It was a much needed update, wasn't it?
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:45.860]   Bit of wild since they updated. I mean, I think the thing that's really interesting is that the
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:51.140]   amount of RAM that ships with the computer being significantly larger than what they used to ship
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:56.420]   and I think we see this now with a lot of their computers. I think they're they're trying to
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.780]   tell us something. Well, I think both VRAM and RAM is are both increasing and you know, they really
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:07.780]   are taking full advantage of that. And I think that I do think that overall these releases answer
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.060]   a lot of questions as people worried about is Apple paying attention to hardware? I mean,
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.780]   sure, they're not doing it with the same fanfare that they have in the past, but it's
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:19.540]   you know, it's not like they're not updating them either. We'll do on Thursday, we do our
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.540]   hardware show with Ryan Shradda, PC perspective, who was actually benchmarked all of these
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:33.380]   pieces, including the i7, including the the ATI video card, the 4870, including the GeForce 120.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.740]   So he can give us some some real world comparisons, you know, to, you know, what's the state of the
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.060]   art out there compared to what with Apple should. When is your coming? By what? Your new, your new
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.780]   Mac Pro? Well, I have to call Apple because then I'll sit down on it. Well, we'll run on
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:51.940]   the test. I'll get the test now. I think that thing is just going to sit there and run hot all day
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:59.540]   running video. I'm excited about it. $5,000 just to sit there and stream video must be nuts.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:05.460]   I'm thinking I don't make any money on the video. It's all on the audio. Yeah.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:10.340]   I'm thinking I'm going to be on a TV again tomorrow morning. It's just I'm just wondering,
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.900]   I just isn't it wonderful just to walk into a room where someone else has bought the camera
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.660]   and the hardware and everything. And you just talk for a while, then you leave and you leave them
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:26.260]   with all the leasing arrangements. Isn't that wonderful? Well, yeah, except that I consider what
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:33.060]   we've done for one probably one one hundreds of what a television station would do. And that's why
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.620]   it doesn't seem expensive to me. Right. You know, I have two different hats. If I know what it would
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:43.140]   cost to do it normally. I mean, I mean, it's the camera. The camera would cost 25,000. Yeah,
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:48.580]   one right one. I mean, it's crazy. Right. So so in that sense, I go, wow, this is a bargain.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:56.420]   But then I write the check. And it's not such a bargain. All right. What did we did? We did we
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.420]   answer the question of whether or not we think it's really worth upgrading though. I mean, did we
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.900]   answer that question? I think here's you know what? Let's go around and get everybody's answer.
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:10.500]   Scott, what would your answer be? Well, you know, my my first reflex to all this stuff is I want one.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:16.420]   And lately, I've been trying to sit back and say, do I really need one? And I was prepared to buy one
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:21.700]   prior to this conversation. But now you've got me wondering, although I do think the additional
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:27.460]   ram for the money and the dish the faster bus will probably lead me to say, yes, I'm going to do it.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:33.620]   But I would I'm less enthusiastic than it was before the show. Sort of like talking to Alex about
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.700]   anything HDA get excited and then he tells me it's crap. I feel bad. I talked you down.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.180]   Andy, an echo, what do you think? Where's the upgrade?
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:47.140]   A high performance machine like this, there's always a latency problem. I'm not talking about
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.700]   inside the processor. I'm talking about the latency between this new processor architecture
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.580]   being released and applications that can really take advantage of it. So if there's anybody who
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.940]   is shopping today who needs to have something in their office next week, then it's probably smart
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:07.220]   to save the money and just buy get a good bargain on something else. It's not going to pay off for
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.540]   another year or so. So I mean, that's usually what I think about when I'm thinking about buying
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.980]   stuff like that. If it's something they're going to be needing for like three or four or five years,
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.260]   it's going to take a while before I'll get that money back, so to speak.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:24.340]   Wait till software comes out to you. Alex Lindsey, you're probably you use the highest end software
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:29.620]   of anybody in the building. I worth up. Almost all of our software, whether it's
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:36.580]   Moto or Cinema 4D or compression software, almost all of it is threaded for all the
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.780]   all the processors and they'll use as much RAM as you can't hand them. I expect to see updates in
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:48.660]   the applications that we use probably within days, if not weeks to take care of it. We're definitely
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.260]   going to be looking seriously into getting a couple new ones to take full advantage of that.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.060]   Because that's to us, that processing power and that and especially we've been we've been
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:02.740]   banging up against that the architecture for a long time and that makes a huge difference for us.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:10.900]   How many Mac Pros do you have? We have five Mac Pros and four of the 24-inch iMacs.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:18.180]   So use iMacs but- We use them for administrative? No, no, we use one of them for administrative.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.420]   Most of them are used actually. We actually edit on them once the heavy compression has been done.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:27.220]   So we capture and the original footage that we work with is generally 180 megabytes a second.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:31.700]   And so it's real heavy and that's what we run through the Mac Pros to do the compositing and
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.700]   set it all up. Once it's been compressed down and ready to edit, we can edit on any of the machines.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.620]   That gets broken into the smaller machines. Save just a little money.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:47.860]   Cool. Well, I guess my take on it is you really got to ask yourself what software you're going to use
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.980]   and more importantly got to ask the vendors of that software. Is it going to be a benefit?
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:30:02.420]   Some, if you look at the Ryan's i7 benchmarks, in some cases the QX9770, the old Xeon,
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:07.460]   is faster because of the faster clocks beyond some software. A software particularly that doesn't
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:14.100]   open eight threads simultaneously. So this is hyper threaded so you really get 16 processors.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.540]   And if an application really can take advantage of it, absolutely.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:22.100]   Well, I think that's the way to go. I do think that it's important that you look at what type
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.420]   of applications the average person using a Mac Pro is going to be using because most of the time
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.900]   pros presume they're pros exactly and for most of those most of the applications and
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:36.020]   operations that are happening on those Mac Pros, I think are the people who are buying them for
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.260]   are going to be multi threaded are going to take advantage of a lot of that stuff.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.860]   New Mac minis and new Mac. Let's start with the iMacs because
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:49.860]   if you've listened to our Mac Pro discussion, maybe you'd be sensible and say, well, maybe I should
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:54.420]   just get an iMac. Maybe I don't. I'm not using a program that's going to use 16.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.820]   Very powerful. These new iMacs. I mean, the last time.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.100]   This is a big improvement on these.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.420]   Well, it's 512 megs of VRAM built in. You can go up a much better video card.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:07.620]   It's actually gigs of RAM Macs, which is insane for an iMac. I mean, it really is
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:14.340]   if we need Mac Pros for what we do, but I have to say that 90% of the population listening to
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.500]   this show, 95% of the iMacs. You're really looking at the iMac. I think it's now
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.860]   the credible machine. They've moneyed the waters. I have to say, okay, I feel like Steve Jobs's
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:29.700]   hand could have been used a little bit in this. I think that they have made it confusing for
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:37.300]   consumers with this entire upgrade, both the Mac Pro upgrade, where the clock speeds are lower,
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:43.940]   but they're claiming they're faster machines. Now we've got 220 and 324 inch models.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:51.940]   It's not merely clock speed of the processor. It's also the video card.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.260]   Well, I think one of the mistakes here is there's no reason not to just have a 20 and 24
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:01.300]   configure your own. Why do they have all these? We don't need to keep on pre-scoring all these.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.940]   It just makes it more confusing. I think this is not a good user experience.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.700]   Not the traditionally good user experience at Apple is what do you think, Andy?
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:15.060]   Well, did Apple ever really say that, hey, go by the clock speed? That's going to be your best
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.300]   guy to what's faster or do you trust? They're the ones who did that whole gigahertz miss.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.780]   They're the ones who keep saying, look, trust us when we tell you that this is faster or this is
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.860]   more suitable for this purpose. That's what you should go by. It's been years since you could
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:34.580]   simply say, well, the Pentium 2 is a 1.8 megahertz. It's probably faster than 1.2.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.300]   It's a little bit of a leap of faith though to see the differential in price between a 2.26
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:48.660]   and a 293 Mac Pro is $1,600 and it's still slower than the cheaper Mac Pro last version on the face of
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.100]   it. You really have to. It's a leap of faith. You have to trust Apple.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:57.460]   Oh, I don't know if it's that big of a leap of faith. Last year, I went through my usual
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:02.900]   biennial or what's interesting? Biennial and semi-annual every two years or so. When I buy
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:08.580]   the when I have to buy a new desktop, that's the first time that I replaced the equivalent of a
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:13.860]   Mac Pro with an iMac and I've never taken a step back ever since. It's just such a wonderfully
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:18.980]   powerful and flexible system for anybody other than people who can calculate how many dollars they
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:27.460]   lose when they lose every 1% of performance. I think the people who are liable to buy an iMac
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.620]   are not the same people who are liable to buy a Mac Pro. The people who come in looking for that
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:38.100]   big slab of cheese grater with no lights, no logos, no smiling faces, no nothing are not the same
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.180]   people who are going to be. They're two different classes of people and they both know what they
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:46.180]   want. They want a good total package that can take out of the box and have up and running in five
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:51.620]   or ten minutes. The Mac Pros are for people who really do want, they really do want to see those
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:57.300]   two columns of bubbling liquid cooling reservoirs on the sides of it like a thinking machine's box
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.980]   because they know that they're just getting performance performance performance out of it.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:05.620]   I don't see that much confusion. What I saw and correct me if I'm wrong, it's actually kind of a
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.420]   price drop because now they're giving you a 24-inch screen for the same price these to go for 20
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:17.460]   inches. Yeah, $14.99 for the $24.26, $6.6 gigahertz. You get a better video card that $9,400
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:22.500]   am. That's the one in the MacBook Pro and the MacBook. People who are going for iMacs will say,
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.620]   wow, bigger screen, same price sign up. I'm good. Yeah, you're right. And they quietly updated the
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:32.740]   Mac MacBook Pro. They did, didn't they? To make it more like the 17 inch. The 15 is more like the
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:37.940]   17 and speed and so forth. All right, let's get to the mini because I think the mini is a
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.220]   well, I'll tell you what, let's take a break and get to the mini. The mini is going to be the
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:48.020]   this funny. This is all the rumors came true. It's exactly the picture and everything.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:54.340]   All right, we're going to talk about who the mini is for and whether it's worth $800.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.260]   That's the top of the line, many before we do that though.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.380]   I want to talk about audible.com. Our great friends at Audible, they're the ones who do the
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:09.540]   audio books. I'm really, you know, it's kind of fun going. I went back and I'm listening to a book
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.460]   that I was one of my favorites in high school. And as I listened to it, I realized my entire
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:20.260]   career trajectory is was defined by this book. I didn't realize what an influence it was. So it's
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:28.100]   kind of fun to go back and listen to classics. Audibles got them, new books. I also am listening to the
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:35.620]   uh, um, outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Boy, is that a, that's a wonderful brain inspire?
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.460]   Annie and I co you got an audible pick for us today?
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:44.260]   Yeah, I got actually this is, this is the second pick that I had lined up. I had another one kind
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:49.060]   of chosen, but if I haven't actually bought the audio book already, I like to make sure that I
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:55.860]   preview it and I won't mention the name of the book, but I, I, I almost want to buy it just to
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.420]   see if I can understand this is what bad like RS, like, rural Shakespeare company acting is like.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:08.180]   It's like, so you previewed this book and you said, uh, exactly. It was, uh, see, a audible gives
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.460]   you a really nice long preview. It's not just 30 seconds, like the iTunes store, you'll almost see
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.940]   here, like five, six, seven, 10 pages of it before you get to the end of it. And this guy,
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:24.820]   well, speaking like this, emphasizing every, what? And the texture. And I'm like, I, if I,
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.780]   it's listening to text to speech, it's like you try not to focus on the voice and you try to pick
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:36.660]   the words out. So instead, I don't know. There are a lot of reasons why you, as a reader, you
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:42.260]   bump up a certain title on your list, first enters your radar for whatever reason. And then
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.940]   things happen to cause you to go from, oh, that's interesting to you. I should buy that sometime,
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:51.060]   do oh, that's going to be one of my next purchases. And there's a book by Gregory David Roberts called
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:58.340]   Shontaram that started off as somebody jokingly recommending it to me, uh, partly because they
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.420]   thought it was a great book, but also because they know that I kind of like these books that,
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:07.300]   but when you use your one, uh, audible credit that you get a month, oh, oh, oh, I just looked at
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.620]   the length. I know where you're going with this one. It's on a bridge for one credit. It's 43
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:19.140]   hours and three minutes. So, so that's exactly if you buy your books by the pound, you'll love
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:24.100]   Shontaram. Exactly. If you want, if you want to like, when he sent it for this package,
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:29.060]   you're like, I want them just to pass like the inot go rule that says that suddenly,
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:34.500]   somewhere buried within the terms of services, you can get one credit, but you can't, you can't
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.300]   download more than 400 hours per year. This actually sounds good. Listen to the, this,
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:44.580]   have you started listening to it? I have actually started listening to it. I did buy it like about
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.180]   two weeks ago. Obviously, I'm not anywhere near through it yet, but I want to point out that it
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:52.740]   wasn't just, oh, hey, look, it's a 43 hour book. That's the one I'm buying. It's two other people
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.660]   just randomly recommended it to me. And then I was at a friend's house a couple of weeks ago,
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:03.140]   and he had it on his desk. He was halfway through it. And it really, it, it, it's a sort of novel
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:07.700]   that I don't think it's written that much these days. James and Minschner used to, it didn't say
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:13.620]   anything. Used to do, you make a big living out of writing huge thick potboiler novels that are
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:20.580]   all that are generally follow the, the, the arc of white guy enters into some exotic culture
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:26.020]   for reasons that because he has a shady past or misguided morals or whatever. And we get to,
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:31.700]   we spend a huge amount of time just seeing this entire world, unfamiliar world through this white
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.220]   guy's eyes. And of course, there's intrigue and there's drugs and there's organized crime and
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.860]   there's poverty and there's, and there's a secret that hopefully no one will find out about. And
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:47.060]   so I bought it on Audible. I am now about five hours into it. And already I'm like, oh, damn,
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.020]   I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to start like running more errands with my car.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:56.980]   It's like Shogun or Taipan or Hawaii. I love those long books.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.940]   They're right. I can really suck you in. I think, and I actually think that I would enjoy it more
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:06.900]   as an audiobook than as printed text because it's the sort of, the sort of writing here isn't
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.980]   the sort of thing where you just, you get to the bottom of a page and you close your eyes and
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:15.780]   sigh and then you read it, reread it again because the writing is just so intense and
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.780]   so lyrical. It's a very, very meat and potato style of writing, but it's very, very effective.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.580]   And it's a great book to be spoken aloud.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.660]   Sean Taram by Gregory David Roberts. You know what, I bought it while you were talking about it.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:32.820]   It just sounds so good. It's my kind of book. And that's the beauty of it. Audible at 51,000
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.300]   titles. You go there, you search your browse, you get recommendations from us or your friends.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.220]   And then it's so easy to buy. By the way, you know Andy about the new format, the E format.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:48.340]   They have a higher quality audio format now. It's incredible, the enhanced format.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.660]   So you can, beauty of Audible is you can go back into your library and download all your books again
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:58.260]   in the E format if you, if you should choose. I'm moving to E for everything that I listen to.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.580]   It's a little bit bigger, but it's super high quality. That sounds so good. Not that they sounded
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:09.460]   bad before. This book nominated also I see for an audio award for solo narration and production.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:17.540]   Sean Taram. It's available in the enhanced format. I'm excited. Actually, let me see. It's 126 megabytes.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:23.540]   Oh wait a minute. I'm sorry. One, two, three, four, five parts. So it's half a gigabyte
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:31.860]   in the, yeah, it's twice twice as big, 253 megabytes in the enhanced. So you got to have a little bit more
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:36.580]   room on your iPod, but you know nowadays, big deal. You got to gig dedicated to a book, big deal.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.660]   You need a new iPod anyway. Yeah, I need to do my my neck.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:46.420]   Finite pot shuffle just for this book. I think they should throw in a iPod just when you buy a Mac
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:54.980]   Pro. Wow. Shantaram audible.com/macbreak. You get a credit toward a book. Absolutely free. This
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:41:02.820]   one's one credit could be yours right now. The fools. What were they thinking? 43 hours for one credit.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.940]   Get it before they actually listen to the show. Yeah. Audible.com/macbreak. We love them. We thank
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:15.060]   it for their support. We encourage you to give them a try. Mac mini time. Anybody want to comment
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:19.940]   on the new Mac mini? Well, I mean, I'm glad to see that they're still updating it. I'm glad to see
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:25.540]   that they're still aware that it's on the price list. Less than happy to see that they still,
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.220]   it seems like something they just want to have on the price list,
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:35.220]   either to win a bar bet or because of some term of some contract they had with some big.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:39.780]   Because I mean, usually Apple is very, very clear about the message on why this,
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.060]   why a certain product needs to exist and why they're proud to have it in their price list.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:48.900]   And I love this product though. I have a soft spot in my heart for the mini.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.060]   But I was expecting that the reason why we've seen they've been so quiet about it was because
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.780]   they're going to do a big rollout with a whole big new reason for it to exist saying, well,
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:04.020]   and we've upgraded. Now, this includes a special edition of Front Row that has
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:11.380]   links into Netflix and has links into Amazon streaming content and into Hulu. This will
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:17.060]   be your console for every piece of electronic content anywhere on the internet. And it also
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:23.140]   doubles as a really, really good headless Mac. Right now, it's hard for me to make the case of
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:30.100]   it's pricey. It's pricey. At 600 bucks, it's not terribly far. It's not terribly close to the
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:36.740]   price of a bottom range iMac. But I really think that its competition has to be all of those really
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:43.380]   affordable Windows machines. Exactly. And a Mac mini is not exactly going to be a dazzling
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:52.100]   consumer experience, not like an iMac is. And when you put a $600 iMac next to a $500 or $600
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:57.700]   HP, let mini tower or anything else that the Dell or HP are making, you're getting a hell
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:03.220]   of a lot more machine for that amount of money. From the Dell. Steve, Steve, I just talked about
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:07.780]   that at length. And he's, they said they just made a conscious choice that they don't want to
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:14.740]   try to compete with the low end PCs that they want to try to keep Mac experience somewhat
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:19.860]   consistent that they need to charge XYZ dollars. I don't think they'll ever be a Mac
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:24.500]   entry computer that competes on that level. But I agree with you, Andy, that it's good to see
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:29.380]   that they're keeping this alive because it does offer hope that maybe the performance end will
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.660]   eventually catch up. I don't think the price point is going to go down much. Well, they could have,
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.500]   they, it's ridiculous. They could have charged half as much on these things. I know. I, I,
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.500]   it's definitely expensive. Yeah. I still have to say that my, my time is valuable to me.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:46.900]   Like I wouldn't, I'm not going to, what do you think that the fact that it be so easy to make a
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:52.900]   hackintosh now might put some pressure on them. It's not that hard. But I think for the average
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.820]   person, I think that they, the average Mac user or someone who just wants a little,
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:02.900]   a little machine or a, or entertainment, I use it as an entertainer. It's really a home theater
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.340]   piece entertainment hub. I mean, that's what that's what I'm using. Did they did now they've,
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:11.460]   they've got many a display port. That's good. That's a new improvement so you can work it with
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:15.780]   the new cinema displays. It's interesting because they have both mini DVI and the display port.
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:23.940]   Have, I don't get the five USB ports except to think that maybe that's because it's going to
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:28.820]   be a pub. I know with mine, I run out of, I run out of USB ports a lot. I find myself,
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.420]   I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I have a 70, I have a bigger hard drives in the stacker with more
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.700]   port, more fun. I don't have that. So for me, plugging it in, having the extra USB is actually
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:44.660]   really great. That's a handy thing. Okay. They say it's more green. Is it more green or just,
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:48.340]   it's the greenest that they make because it doesn't have a screen? That always helps.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:56.260]   Many harmful toxins eliminated. They've removed. Yes, many. I underscore many. Many.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.740]   They were still still so kids still don't know. It's like this.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:08.340]   No, you did it. Highly. I admire him for doing that, but I don't know why they make that big
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:13.300]   deal of that. It's got the because they want to save us from having those people.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:21.060]   We know that Scott sounds like a robot, by the way, don't send me email.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:28.020]   We're just pretending that he hasn't been converted to a silon. Is it that bad? Yeah,
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.660]   that's okay. You're the Kenny of this episode. You'll speak for 10 seconds and we'll all giggle
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:38.340]   and say, yeah, double what he said. Do you check sign off?
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:42.340]   Okay, we don't know what you said the last thing you said though. Could you repeat that?
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:48.100]   I said that the reason that they do it is because they want to save us from all those people that
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:53.380]   hand us the green flyers at the back world job. It's an anti-green piece initiative.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:46:02.580]   The N94, Nvidia 9400M, which is now in boy, Apple's an Nvidia house now, man. They're using
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.820]   Nvidia for it. They seem to go back and forth. Sometimes you just want them to make up their mind.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.700]   Well, the industry goes back and forth. I think that's what they're responding to.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:17.300]   This 9400 is a good part for a portable computer. I don't know for them. I guess it's okay for many.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:24.020]   I wonder if this is the ion platform. I think it is, but I'd have to look and get the specs more.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.100]   Well, I know that there were rumors that Apple was having a hard time getting the Nvidia stuff
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.500]   to really work well. Actually, it can't be the last update. So it seems like they've gotten over
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:37.220]   that. Yeah, that's right. They were having some issues. Gigabit Ethernet, Firewire 800,
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:41.780]   Firewire 400 is dead. Yeah. Can we call it? I'm fine with that.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.740]   I think we're going to actually get 800.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:50.180]   Yeah, please don't give up on fire. I'm really I am. I have to say, I'm really glad to see both of
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:56.580]   these models. Yeah. Contain keeping a firewire port. The IMAX have firewire. Yeah, the IMAX have
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:02.580]   firewire. The Mac mini has firewire 800. It's cool. The internal drive on this IMAX died.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:08.100]   I have a firewire hard drive and I'm booting from that. You wouldn't know there's anything wrong.
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:13.860]   I mean, I get that USB is more ubiquitous, but it's crap. It's crap. It's a crap format. It's
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:18.340]   crap. The Firewire is here. Here's the thing. Why don't some of these things have here?
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:25.940]   I really don't understand, for instance, why the Mac Pros and the IMAX at least don't have HDMI
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:30.500]   and why I don't support Blu-ray. These are some questions I think that we haven't touched on
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:34.900]   that are still being asked. Because I use a bag of hurt. That's right. I forgot.
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:42.980]   I think Apple doesn't want to do what Microsoft did do, which is work with the movie industry to
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:49.300]   support all of this crap copy protection. You've got to do HDCP from end to end. You have to
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:56.020]   update all of your monitors. I don't blame them. I agree. You want to put an HDMI port on there,
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:03.620]   though? But the HDMI has all kinds of rules about... They could do it easier than doing a Blu-ray.
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:09.300]   But HDMI still has to include a lot of the same content control stuff in the HDMI format.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:13.380]   DisplayPort is a good... We're going to sidestep all of that.
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:17.780]   Yeah. It's a good choice because you could go HDMI from the mini DisplayPort, right?
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:22.020]   I think there's a converter for that. Now, does it carry audio on it?
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.500]   I do new. That's a big issue.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:30.580]   Well, for instance, all these new cameras here at the Full of Remarg noise and trade show have
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:35.780]   HDMI out. That's a good point. All the cameras do, don't they? But there's no issue with them.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:40.820]   They have their own content. They never playback proprietary content.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:45.700]   I know. So my point is, though, I mean, couldn't Apple and instead of assuming we'll all be criminals,
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:50.340]   just say, "Okay, here's your HDMI port so you can dump your content from your brand new Panasonic
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:57.780]   G1H." I just think that they don't want to get into that. It impinges on too many places of
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.540]   what they're doing because while we're not all criminals, there are a lot of people that use
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:05.860]   iTunes and use a lot of other things. And having that as a DisplayPort and having to go end to end
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.980]   on that, I think would make it much more complicated for Apple.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.300]   I could see why they don't want to get in that business, I guess.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:17.780]   And I think also that with Blu-ray, Apple is holding now. I think it's more than just,
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:23.860]   I think it's a philosophy that they think that the future is online. And when I look at a PS3,
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:29.460]   if you have a PS3 and you look at the display of data and you look at it that it's only 20,
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:38.580]   Blu-ray is 25 to 30 megabits per second. And I am getting, my Comcast here in Petaluma is 30
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:46.260]   megabits down consistently. We're not that far away from being able to get Blu-ray quality
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.660]   in HD to our home sets.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:59.940]   So the mini 699, I'm sorry, 599 for, it seems like you should buy the 599.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.900]   Yeah, there's no reason to buy the $100 one.
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:09.300]   Yeah. Because all you get for 200 bucks more is a gig of memory and a bigger hard drive,
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.060]   200 gig. Neither of which you normally use.
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:16.100]   Well, oh, so what do you do if you use your mini as a home theater piece?
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:16.900]   I have a Drobo hook to it.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.700]   You put it out in Drobo.
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:19.460]   So all my video and still...
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.740]   So get the small hard drive.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.980]   Yeah, just get the small hard drive and throw a Drobo on your memory.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.340]   Or a hard drive, whatever you want to do.
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:25.860]   You can put some memory in if you want.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:26.260]   But I mean...
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.340]   Do you have two slots or just one slot?
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.780]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.220]   It's also hard to open the mini.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.740]   Yeah, they're only charging 50 bucks for two gigs.
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.500]   150 bucks.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.420]   Apple for four gigs.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:39.540]   Apple!
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.580]   But you don't really need four gigs.
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:40.980]   What would you...
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.620]   I mean, I guess I would say what are you doing putting four gigs?
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:47.780]   They charge me 200 for four gigs on my new 17 inch Mac Pro.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:48.180]   I know.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:49.540]   I know.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:53.140]   Well, we're also kind of overlooking one of the big markets for this.
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.940]   I time and time again when people give me a tour...
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:59.460]   Well, I meant some company to give me a tour of their data closet.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.900]   I see Mac Minnie's...
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:05.300]   Oh, he froze.
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.420]   He's a good looking guy when he's froze solid though.
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.460]   Look at that, not moving.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.580]   Ah, hold on, just pause.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.220]   We're having a hit.
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:13.380]   No.
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.100]   Give a day with Skype.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:14.820]   Okay, go ahead now.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.580]   Well...
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.780]   I'm not that good of an troll quest, I was kind of...
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:23.860]   I freak out Leo, but just like not moving around like this.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:27.140]   You look like clutch cargo.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:27.620]   It's good.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.500]   Just the lips move.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.060]   No, it would be...
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:31.460]   I have a...
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.700]   It would be...
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.540]   Well, Leo, let me read you the specs.
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:36.980]   Well, the thing...
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:40.580]   According to this document that I've seen online, it goes...
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.780]   Ahhh!
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:44.180]   Okay.
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.620]   Getting back to the...
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.660]   Getting back to your point.
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:47.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:50.980]   I mean, time and time again, like TV stations, NASA, everywhere.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.620]   You'll see like these racks and racks and racks of these Cisco boxes,
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:58.020]   but then you'll see one tiny lonely little Mac Minnie somewhere in the rack,
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:02.900]   because the system in likes to use certain diagnostic apps,
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:08.020]   or likes to use certain server apps, or wants to run that version of Apache.
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.380]   And so I find a lot of folks who are using it, again, as a cheap ex-serve.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.060]   So, I don't know, maybe that's...
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.100]   That's interesting.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.740]   I mean, it's powerful enough to do that.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.740]   But you would want to put more RAM in there, right?
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.060]   I'm sure they max it out.
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.900]   And obviously, they're not using it.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.020]   They're not using as their like one-head rendering farm.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.420]   It's more like the software that they use to figure out what all the other blades are doing
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.420]   is being run on the Mac Minnie.
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:37.380]   Or again, they have an internal website, or even their fun website that they use,
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:41.940]   not to stream video from, but just to direct incoming traffic from the outside,
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.900]   gets off on a Mac Minnie.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.660]   And the reason why is always exactly the same,
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:48.740]   because this is the one box, this entire room that is not a pain in the butt to administer.
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:52.500]   I have a real soft spot for the Mini.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:53.300]   I think it's just a really...
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.220]   I love my Mini.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.100]   I want to buy more.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.700]   I only have one, the one.
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.300]   But it's our home theater system here.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:00.660]   You know, we got everything going on.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:03.780]   Well, at this price, I'm not buying another one.
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.980]   It's just too expensive.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.100]   But you're saying don't get the $7.99, go with a $5.99.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.580]   If you needed more, you could upgrade it easily.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.300]   What do you use, a spatula?
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:15.460]   I don't upgrade it.
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:15.860]   I just...
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.660]   I get them.
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.820]   It does what I needed to do when I'm watching it.
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.180]   I don't need any more than that.
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.540]   They have apples.
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:28.420]   I don't know if they still do this, but they used to have a special apple.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.300]   What do they call the thing?
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.580]   It's like a spackle, a spud-laid.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.260]   A spudger.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:36.820]   A spudger?
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:37.460]   Is that what they call it?
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:37.860]   A spudger?
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:38.260]   Yep.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.060]   It's for smoothing out spackle when you're...
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:42.980]   Or drywall.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.180]   Those are really good for making sand castles as well.
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:46.420]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:47.220]   Just in case you're wondering.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:47.380]   It's...
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:52.820]   But the apple has a special spudger that's like polished and finely honed.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.260]   But it's the same thing that you used it.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.740]   You jam in the side of the mini and you pry it apart.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:03.620]   You could order the $200 apart from apple or just go down to your hardware store and get a
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:04.100]   spudger.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.020]   Or not bother.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:06.660]   Yeah, are they gonna...
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.020]   Andy, just tell me the truth.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:10.660]   Are they gonna laugh at me if I go to my hardware store and ask for a spudger?
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:11.140]   Spudger.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:17.940]   All of the thing is, every time I've seen someone sell me or offer me or show me
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:23.380]   a nylon chisel-like device that is firm enough to get...
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:29.060]   Is there enough to wedge between two sides of a component and strong enough to apply a
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.740]   torque without scratching the case?
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:31.780]   It's been called a spudger.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:38.180]   I don't know whether there was a Antonio L. Spudger in 1971 who was the first one to
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.620]   improvise such an implement while servicing Burrough's line equipment.
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.900]   You said it's Burroughs with a spudger?
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.220]   Well, I made that up.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:50.020]   Well, actually, if we put this on Wikipedia, then that comes with factors.
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:50.900]   That becomes true, yes.
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:54.900]   But every time that I've asked one, "Hey, I need a spudger," they hand me
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.020]   exactly what I was expecting.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.860]   Sometimes called a putty knife.
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.700]   That's the other word.
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:00.740]   Well, that's the professional word.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.260]   Spudger is sounding nicer.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:02.580]   The metal...
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:04.820]   I'd like a spudger.
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:10.260]   I've been reading your Michael Palin's "Molly Python" diary, Zandy, and I'm just loving it,
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:11.940]   but it makes me want to talk like that.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:12.340]   Hello.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.180]   You got my spudges in here?
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.780]   Just love that.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.860]   Okay.
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:18.820]   Okay.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.100]   Any other news?
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.940]   It's interesting how the rumor mill got this all right, right on.
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.900]   They didn't tell me about the New Mac Pro, though.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.580]   I wish they had said something about that.
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:32.260]   But in general, this, in fact, yesterday...
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.820]   Well, Steve leaves and everything gets a little on Poris at Apple.
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:35.700]   It gets a little Poris.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:40.500]   My Mac magazine, mymac.com, had a post from John Far.
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:44.020]   Yesterday saying, "Here's the specs.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.540]   We know everything."
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.980]   And actually Forbes had, I thought, a good article saying,
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.140]   "This is actually brilliant marketing.
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.060]   It's called Marketing by Spy Shot."
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:57.860]   And, you know, frankly, I guess it was fortunate to have the article.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:01.140]   Frankly, even if Apple's not planning this on purpose,
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.820]   it's a good idea.
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.460]   It might be getting a good point where they don't need to run these big press releases.
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.500]   They don't need to have these big events because...
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.220]   They didn't have an event.
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.020]   They didn't do anything.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.700]   Was there a press release?
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.700]   I'm sure there was.
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.900]   And, Andy, did you get a call from...
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.300]   I did not get a call from Apple.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:18.980]   I didn't get any tip off.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:23.860]   I think though that doesn't indicate that these are all the products where they feel...
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.540]   Maybe with the exception of the iMac.
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:28.820]   These are all products where they don't feel as though they need to make a marketing
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.940]   push to it, where, in the case of the Mac Pro,
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:36.580]   people who are interested in that already know about it or I'm already looking around for it,
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.700]   the Mac Mini, I think we've kind of shown that they don't really care about it.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.940]   The iMac, it's more price shifts.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.860]   They didn't retool anything and they didn't redesign anything.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.460]   They didn't do a cool new case design, I should say.
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.060]   So, I don't know.
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:54.340]   You would expect something a little bit bigger from Apple,
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.580]   but it doesn't make no sense.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.420]   No double negative here.
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.460]   It's not nonsense that they would do this quite this quietly.
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:06.740]   Well, they did.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.460]   And I wish they had told me ahead of time.
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.980]   That's all I could say.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.580]   I'm just glad I didn't do it at 1 p.m.
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:14.580]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.460]   Thank you Apple for not waiting till after Mac Break Weekly was over,
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.100]   because we would have really come out looking like doofuses.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.620]   Not that it's ever happened before.
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:21.940]   No.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:25.540]   We know we broke many cycles.
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:26.660]   We didn't break them all.
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.620]   I'm glad to see we have the Leobies a new computer
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.140]   and then they announce a new one.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.740]   Some of the routines are still in place.
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:38.660]   The thing is, I don't believe this whole thing about Leobies a computer
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:39.860]   and then Apple releases something.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.660]   I don't believe it.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.980]   I know it's not true, except it keeps happening.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:48.420]   It just happens like 900 times.
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:52.420]   You know what they say that one of the definitions of insanity
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.620]   is doing the same thing over and over again,
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:54.420]   expecting something different.
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:55.620]   But what could I have done differently?
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.580]   I needed a Mac Pro.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.820]   I ordered it on Saturday on Monday.
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:57:59.700]   They released new ones.
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:03.220]   I think you should buy a new iPhone in June.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.140]   Hey, that's a good question.
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:05.780]   Somebody sent me that.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:07.220]   Somebody told me that on Twitter.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:09.300]   They said, "Well, okay, quick, buy a new iPhone.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.740]   Do you think they'll be a new iPhone in June?"
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.660]   They've done it every year in June.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:13.940]   I really think it's going to be a tablet.
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:15.220]   In June.
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:16.660]   Tablet in June, Andy Naco.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.140]   You agree?
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:17.860]   Tablet in June?
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.420]   I wouldn't put money on a tablet.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.860]   They definitely have to release something new in the touch line in June.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.300]   Scott Bourne, tablet in June, Mr. iPhone?
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:29.540]   No, no tablet, the deaf, Hindu iPhone.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:30.420]   And here's the answer.
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.140]   Why?
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.700]   It's two-year anniversary of the first one.
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:35.620]   And everybody's contracted Spires.
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.380]   And they've got to find a new hook to get them back in.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.660]   Oh, excellent point.
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.100]   Excellent point.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:43.780]   Those who didn't buy the new one will be shopping.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.580]   I think my reasoning for the tablet being in June,
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:48.820]   and I could be wrong, I've been wrong before,
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.540]   is that WWDC is coming.
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:54.500]   If you wanted to talk about how to program for a new
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.580]   application, what you'd want to do is release
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:59.540]   that if you want to have a new device,
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:01.780]   you'd want to release it right before you had
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.700]   something where you could talk about how to program for that new device.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:09.220]   That's my opinion of why before WWDC, we'll see something.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.220]   But that's sort of why we're saying,
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:14.900]   why we would be saying no release in June,
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.060]   because it would have to have three or four months of the two.
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:17.940]   Okay, well, but--
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:18.500]   Announce.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:18.900]   --announce.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:19.860]   --announce.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.460]   I don't mean release like shipping.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:22.820]   I just mean that we'll see it.
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.140]   And then you'd be able to have people talk about it,
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:29.540]   you'd be able to give people the application simulators,
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.460]   you'd be able to do all the stuff so that it's ready to go,
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:32.180]   when it's ready to go.
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.420]   I think it depends on whether we're figuring that Apple is selling this
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:41.460]   as a consumer device like an iPod or a productivity device like a Mac Mini.
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:44.420]   Because if it's a consumer device,
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.900]   they're definitely going to want to have a full, full pipeline
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:50.020]   of both applications and hardware in time for September,
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.860]   the very, very latest to make sure that they can just
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.500]   sell, sell, sell, sell, sell for the holiday season.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.260]   If they're selling it as their answer to a netbook, let's say,
[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.540]   then that can wait until--
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:04.020]   Gio, I was going to say that could wait until January in Mac world expo,
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.860]   but now we've removed that deadline.
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:09.060]   So that can wait until after the holiday season.
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.580]   I think it's their answer to a netbook.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.700]   I think people who bought an iPhone two years ago will buy a 3G.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.860]   I don't think that they're going to do a lot to that.
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.060]   Right.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:23.460]   And I think Steve coming back and announcing a new netbook in June
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.620]   after he took his little vacation would be perfect.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.660]   That's always been my sign of optimism that at least that
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:31.620]   announcement was made.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:34.500]   Steve believes, or the people who are in his camp,
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.100]   believe that he's going to be back and back on doing the injury because
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:41.060]   they basically-- it seems as though they picked the last date that they can pick
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:44.420]   when they would definitely want the big guy out there showing off something bright and shiny.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:44.660]   Right.
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.980]   Well, folks.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.500]   Oh, one more story at the Apple investors meeting.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:59.140]   One of the directors asked Point Blank what they think is going to happen in June,
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:05.300]   said as far as we know, it is our belief that nothing has changed from the announcement that Steve
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:05.860]   will be back.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:15.540]   And I think when a director says that at a investor meeting that carries more weight--
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.220]   Scott would say there's a fiduciary duty.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.660]   That the fiduciary duty.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:22.020]   And look, I made a fiduciary duty.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:29.300]   And it's even more than saying it in an analyst call.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.100]   This is the-- you're talking to the shareholders here.
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:32.580]   Right, Scott?
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.380]   This was the most significant thing.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:40.820]   I don't know if anybody cares about the inside baseball business stuff when I talked about it.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:44.180]   But when I saw that my heart skipped a little happy beat.
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.580]   Because I thought to myself, well, tomorrow's not promised to any of us.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:53.940]   But for sure, they don't have any reason to believe he won't be because they wouldn't have done that.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:57.860]   That may be the most actionable thing they would have done had it.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.180]   Atly untrue.
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:01.540]   Good.
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.100]   Yay!
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:06.100]   But doesn't that sound like sort of a meaningless statement?
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.460]   Because--
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.780]   Make meaningless statements and shareholder meetings, Andy.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:14.180]   Every single word is under the auspices of Sarbanes, Oxley, my friend.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.500]   And nothing's meaningless when you can go to jail.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.620]   But they did kind of parse it.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:22.260]   But I'm saying that wouldn't it be true-- and this is the--
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.940]   wouldn't it be true that if you're sending someone out there to do the shareholders briefing
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:31.460]   and you know that, oh, but-- this person has to be briefed on what the answers to all the questions
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.220]   are going to be, if there's a question that they don't want to answer, do they have the ability
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:41.540]   to simply say, not willfully say, now Ted, we're not going to tell you about the Mac Mini shipping
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.660]   late because if they ask you about that, you'd have to tell them that shipping late and that could be
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.300]   trouble.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:49.300]   Or do they simply just leave that off the briefing and leave then leave this guy with the knowledge
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.180]   that, well, as far as I know, the Mac Mini is still shipping on time.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.660]   I mean, sure enough.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.340]   You can surely get too cute for school and I understand where you're coming from.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:04.100]   But generally, you know, in shareholders' meetings today, they're not going to do stuff like that.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.380]   There's just too much at risk.
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.460]   And they knew that this question would come.
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:13.220]   I mean, you know, you could see them backstage before the meeting saying, okay, what are we going
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:19.060]   to say when they say, where is Steve? What is our line? I'll read it exactly.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:26.980]   Apple Director Arthur Levinson, when asked, by the way, only one guy asked for details on jobs health
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:32.020]   and asked when the board knew Jobs planned to step away from his daily duties.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:38.180]   Apple Director Arthur Levinson responded that since Jobs announced the Jobs announced with
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:43.460]   January 14th, they needed to go on leave, nothing quote, nothing has changed.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:51.380]   I guess that could, in court, you could say, well, but I mean, part of the announcement was,
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.420]   I'm coming back in June, right?
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.540]   Exactly.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.540]   Exactly.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:01.300]   And the question was really specifically, you know, when is he coming back?
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:02.500]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:08.340]   I mean, anything can happen. And, you know, they could have had a very good faith belief that he is
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:13.940]   coming back. And then he still might not. But I just don't personally believe, and it's just
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.860]   an opinion, which means nothing. But I don't personally believe that they have any reason to
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.300]   think he's not coming back.
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:25.860]   Right. Me neither. My opinion is that it is exactly as they've been saying that there's every
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.860]   anticipation he's coming. He's planning to come back in June, and he's going to be back in June.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:32.020]   I don't see any information to contradict that.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:32.580]   Good.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.020]   And I sure hope he is.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:34.980]   Ah, we all do.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.340]   And I have.
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.140]   Go ahead.
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:42.260]   Even if he announces that he said, just like just like was after his ultralight accident,
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:45.300]   said that, you know what, I'm glad that I'm going to be fine. I came through this.
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.100]   Okay. But this is told taught me that there are things other than technology.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:51.780]   And I'm retiring as CEO so I can go sail the world and start a rock band.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.980]   That would be fine by me too.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.700]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.940]   Yeah. That'd be fine too. We just wanted to be okay.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:01.860]   That's the main thing. I mean, you know, if you deal with illness and you know what kind of impact
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:06.500]   you can have on your life, it's stuff like, wow, I wonder if I'm going to make today's
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:10.260]   shareholder meeting becomes a lot less important to you than, wow, I wonder if I'm going to get to
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.340]   see my kids have a wedding. Right. Yeah.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:18.260]   Well, I just, I don't know. Maybe we're maybe I'm putting too much into this, but I just,
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.100]   I think this is good news.
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:20.420]   Very.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:25.940]   No, I was equally excited by it. I didn't want to bring it up, but I was equally excited about the deal.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:26.180]   Good. Good.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:32.740]   A couple of other small stories. You can now do mobile me on your time capsule,
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.020]   mobile me remote file access.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:38.900]   And it won't work just as well in the time capsule as it.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:39.700]   Exactly.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:45.060]   But we can add it on the feature list because it won't work any worse.
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.940]   Hey, hey, guess what? It also works on the iPhone.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.180]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:53.060]   Might as well just write that in just as well. Everything works just as well.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.860]   How do you guys like Safari for now here? We've had it for a week.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:03.060]   It came out exactly a week ago, Tuesday.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:07.940]   It's pretty snappy. I had a couple of freezes where my entire computer just stops
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.620]   being interactive for a minute.
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.900]   That's not good.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.860]   And it's happened since I installed it, but of course I installed stuff all the time.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.660]   So I'm not.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.460]   We don't know what we have.
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.980]   There has been reports when I twitted it.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.420]   I did say people were telling me that other people were having the same issue where
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:23.620]   your mouse moves, but your screen doesn't react to it.
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.500]   And it seemed to only be happening when Safari was open.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.500]   But I have to admit that I've been using it for the last.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:33.780]   I restarted a couple times and did the, you know, did all the basic stuff you do to kind
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.380]   of clean your computer up and I haven't had it since.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.300]   So it might have just been something as part of the install.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.020]   Hey, I do have a piece of news.
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:44.500]   We have a covered book that's actually directly related to Max, but out of PMA,
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:52.340]   Apple did update the camera raw version to include support for the new
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:07:02.020]   Nikon PX3 and the new little rangefinder camera from Vivitar, but not for the LX3.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:06.020]   Interesting.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.620]   But the LX3, there was LX3 support, I thought.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:10.100]   No.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:10.900]   Not an aperture?
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.460]   It's an Adobe camera raw, but not an aperture.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:13.940]   Oh, it is.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:14.900]   It's not an aperture.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.980]   And Adobe had to do a weird thing.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:21.300]   They couldn't do, you know, they had to kind of do, you know, the technical terms,
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.980]   but it wasn't ideal.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.100]   The file size is blue.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:29.700]   There's a conflict with the SDK in Panasonic and after dealing with Panasonic's PR team today,
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.780]   I'm now ready to think it's Panasonic's fault.
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:37.860]   I have no effort into that, but if I were to bet on one or the other,
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.580]   who's Apple or Panasonic, I'd be betting on Panasonic.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:45.700]   You know, it was kind of shocking to me to not see the LX3 included in there,
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.340]   but to see a camera that's only been announced.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:52.100]   I he, the Vivitar rangefinder isn't even shipping yet.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.500]   It's just been announced and they got support for that.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.380]   Well, I think Apple's very aggressive about wanting to get this thing working.
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.380]   I don't think it's them holding anything up.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:04.100]   I think it's definitely Panasonic because they're just really sensitive about this.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.380]   It's that barrel correction, right?
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.260]   Barrel correction in their door.
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:06.900]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.260]   That's it.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:14.980]   And I talked to numerous people from both Japan and the US part of Panasonic today
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.940]   and got nothing but the cold shoulder trying to get any info.
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.420]   Actually, almost got thrown out of the booth.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.220]   Huh, really?
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:22.820]   Wow.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.700]   Guy keeps saying, "Boo's not officially open."
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.380]   Wow.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:30.660]   Like, yeah, but I got a press badge so it's open to me.
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:33.140]   Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:38.180]   But anyway, it is important to know that you do have new support in iPhoto09
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:43.140]   for those two cameras plus the usual stability correction for some issues.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.180]   Yay, yay.
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:46.980]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:48.900]   Come back with your picks of the week.
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:53.220]   I don't have a jingle for that.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:55.780]   Sounds like a tone trying to play the trumpet.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:58.980]   Tubby the tuba.
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:08:59.940]   Remember Tubby the tuba?
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:04.420]   No, that's not Tubby the tuba.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:05.220]   That's unbelumpas.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:10.660]   I do have, I think I should play Scott's jingle just to make him happy.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.740]   Scott boy.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:19.060]   Just make a beautiful sound of a full sing jingle.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.020]   You know, when we, after we were talking about jam, somebody sent me,
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.260]   I got to give you a copy of these.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:31.060]   Jam on their 20th anniversary made a bunch of demo discs and there's a special jam.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.900]   I'll tell you what, after we do our picks, I'll play the jam song for you,
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:37.140]   which is a bunch of jam jingles all mixed together.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:42.100]   If you're a radio jingle fan, you're going to love it.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:42.820]   Jingle's are great.
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:43.940]   We all have jingles here.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:49.700]   Thanks to the, the great Jeff Smith.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:50.180]   It didn't work.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.020]   I sent him his picture by the way and he got it.
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:52.660]   Oh good.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:55.140]   And he a not go.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:59.940]   All right, we're going to do our picks in just a second.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.940]   Ladies and gentlemen, before we do the picks,
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:05.300]   let's not imagine our friends at go to meeting.
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:10.500]   Yeah, if you have a meat, oh, I, okay, there are some competing products and
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.420]   competitors for go to meeting out there.
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:19.860]   And we used one, you know, our, our payroll company uses a different product.
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:21.060]   It's from Microsoft.
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.420]   You know which one I'm talking about.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.700]   It is so god awful.
[01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.460]   It is so awful.
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:29.540]   No, no, I want to, I want to, first of all, it doesn't work with the Mac.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.380]   First thing I do is I go to my iMac.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:31.940]   No, sorry.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.420]   Of course not.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:35.220]   You have to use Internet Explorer and it's active ex controls.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.860]   And I'm thinking, why aren't you using go to meeting units?
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:43.780]   Oh god, you know, go to meeting spoils you go to meeting is online meeting the way it ought to be.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:44.900]   There are other products.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.060]   I'm not saying there aren't, but I've tried them all.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.540]   I'm sometimes forced to by other companies.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:53.060]   And look, listen, when you are doing a sales pitch to a client,
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:58.420]   you do not want to do something that makes them, for instance, not use their Mac
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.660]   or makes them install active.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.580]   You can't make a client jump through hoops.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.900]   If you're trying to sell them something, it doesn't work.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:05.460]   That's why we.
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:09.700]   Jones, this warning message that says it's trying to install something on my computer.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.340]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:10.740]   What?
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:11.620]   How exactly?
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:12.980]   It's not fair in advance contract.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.660]   Yeah, right.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:16.820]   I'm working on the Marine one.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.660]   I don't think I can install that.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.540]   So go to meeting.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.100]   You don't have to worry.
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:20.900]   Here's the deal.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.460]   Do it right now.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.180]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.260]   It takes two minutes to install.
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.180]   Now you do have to install, well, not exactly install,
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.780]   but you have to set it up on your computer.
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.700]   But their client doesn't.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.460]   What you'll do is you'll say you could do it ahead of time.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:35.380]   You could send them an email and say, you know, we're going to have a meeting
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.420]   at 10 o'clock.
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.460]   Here's the link.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:37.860]   Go there.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:41.380]   I'll meet you there at 10 o'clock or even while you're on the phone with somebody,
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.580]   you could say, look, I've got to show you the keynote.
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.820]   I've got to show you some drawings.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:47.860]   We're going to collaborate, whatever.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:50.180]   Here's what you tell your client.
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:50.820]   It's this simple.
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.820]   You can see my screen right now.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:55.220]   Just go to go to meeting.com and enter the meeting ID.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.340]   It's like a six digit number.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.140]   And that's all they do.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:58.340]   And they're seeing it.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:01.220]   And it goes even farther than that because you could say to them,
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.540]   all right, I'm going to let you work on a document together.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:06.980]   Why don't you type a little bit here?
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:07.540]   You could type.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.340]   You could collaborate.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.180]   You could do training.
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.180]   So if you're on a Mac and he's on Windows machine and you're running go to meeting,
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:17.060]   even if he has a Windows machine, he can use your Mac software.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:17.940]   So you know, this is what you do.
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.580]   You show him how much better keynote is than PowerPoint.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:23.220]   Say, you know, you're trying it.
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:23.940]   Just give it a try.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.020]   And he'll say, how can I get this?
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.460]   And you'll say, you can't.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.020]   You have to get it.
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.700]   Go to meeting.
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.180]   It's great.
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:31.300]   Yeah, even for that.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.980]   Go to meeting.com/Macbreak.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.020]   I want you to try it today.
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:37.860]   30 days free unlimited use as many meetings as you want as long as you want.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.740]   And then after the 30 days is up, if you continue to want to use it,
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.660]   it's still very affordable, one low flat monthly rate.
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.060]   For as many meetings as you like, you don't have to count the meetings
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.500]   or even watch the clock just, you know, use it as much as you want.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:55.940]   You get, by the way, built in free VoIP, VoiceOver Internet and free teleconferencing.
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:58.580]   Makes it very easy to use within the application.
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.900]   As I said, now Mac and PC compatible.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:03.140]   I just think this is a no brainer.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:05.860]   I don't, there's, there are other products out there.
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:06.820]   I see the ads for them.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.500]   Trust me.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.180]   Trust me.
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:16.580]   You don't want to be that guy that your clients are going, oh no, please.
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:18.340]   Don't not again.
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.380]   Not again.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.980]   Go to, they love go to meeting.
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.300]   Go to meeting.com/Macbreak.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.940]   We thank them for their support of our show.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.340]   They wouldn't be on Macbreak weekly if it weren't a great Mac product.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:29.380]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.260]   Yep.
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.740]   Speaking of Mac picks.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:33.060]   Okay.
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.340]   Now, now I can use the jingles.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.780]   This is where I use the jingles.
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:38.180]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for...
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.460]   Scott Bawr.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.380]   That is pick of the week.
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.420]   But they come that July from Las Vegas and the PMA trade show.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.220]   This is Scott Bawrnden.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:45.860]   Here's my pick.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.940]   It's the Jokes N'Rilla Pod Focus.
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.140]   Oh, yes.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.580]   Mostly Lisa had one of those.
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.340]   Yeah, but here's the big news.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.860]   They announced it to show Leo instead of $1.39.95,
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.700]   which has been priced for quite some time.
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.500]   They're dropping the price for everybody to $1.09.95,
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.260]   which makes it a lot more reasonable.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:02.660]   Wow.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.140]   And this is their biggest unit.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.420]   It weighs about a pound,
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:09.220]   but it'll hold up to 11 pounds of camera gear.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:14.740]   Now, for your information, that means even your long length is on a big DSLR
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.820]   with the battery pack and everything.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.820]   You can stick it in your pocket.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.980]   You can wrap it around your camera bag.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.060]   I'm extremely impressed with this company.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:27.620]   They started out as literally a guerrilla company,
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.060]   but they really expanded their line.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.700]   I see pro photographers using their stuff all the time.
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.980]   This thing is actually good enough to replace a tripod
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:37.140]   in about 90% of the situations.
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:37.940]   Wow.
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.500]   Wow.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.380]   That's very cool.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:42.500]   And it's available at Jobe.com.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:47.220]   It's now $1.09.95, even though their website today says $1.39.95.
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:51.460]   That announced an impressive video dropping the price.
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.220]   So I play with this thing.
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.900]   It's more than it is sturdy.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:57.620]   I actually tried to pull the car.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.740]   It couldn't be an idiom.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.380]   Okay, whatever he said.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:06.580]   All I heard was I tried to pull my thing hard and then run things and go,
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:07.220]   "Oh, I didn't even..."
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.780]   It's made it tritanium.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.020]   It's made it your thing has made it titanium.
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.540]   Wow.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:18.180]   Oh, it sounds like it is.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.180]   It sounds like everything's made.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:22.340]   It sounds like your whole body's made it titanium.
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.380]   It's the...
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:23.380]   It's the...
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.420]   I'll grab a wallie.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:24.820]   I'm old.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.420]   [laughter]
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.300]   Wallie.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:31.060]   Yee.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:31.620]   It's not a bug.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.100]   It's a feature.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.060]   It's that.
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.860]   I seed the floor to one of my less metallic products.
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:38.180]   No, I want to get this.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.540]   I love the gorilla pot.
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.180]   I really do.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.780]   I think it's a great product.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:43.380]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for...
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.780]   Andy Anatko.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.420]   Yes.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:47.700]   Your pick of the week, Mr. Y.
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.540]   Well, okay.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:53.860]   You've heard me give proper credit and do
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.420]   to the wonderfulness and the perfection.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.500]   That is the 511 Tactical Pant.
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.940]   Yes, we have.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:01.540]   [laughter]
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.660]   Yes, we have.
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:05.620]   These are like favorite pants in the world.
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.860]   They hold all your electronics,
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.420]   hold everything.
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:09.860]   They look like a million bucks.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:10.420]   They fit great.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.420]   I don't like six or seven pairs myself.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:16.660]   Now, 511 Tactical sent me the tactical shirt to match.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:21.540]   And I'm willing to chryse in this as the most
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.220]   awesome travel shirt ever.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.860]   Because you need something that's...
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:28.180]   First of all, it's just a very, very durable shirt.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:28.740]   It's cotton.
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.660]   It's triple stitched everywhere.
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:32.020]   It's got gussets where you need them.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.340]   It's got vents in the back so that it gets a little bit warm.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.700]   It gets some ventilation back there.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:36.900]   It has...
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:41.060]   Leo, you have video, yeah?
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.420]   I have video, yes.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.540]   What should I show?
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:44.660]   Video of you, yes.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:46.340]   Are you going to show us your tactical shirt?
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.340]   Well, I'm wearing the tactical shirt.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.980]   And I can't give you the full print.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.580]   You look like somebody from Blackwater.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:53.300]   Or should I say...
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.340]   She...
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:58.740]   I can either confirm or deny that I have any relationship.
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:16:59.220]   He does.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.180]   He looks like a Muron.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.140]   He looks like a Muron.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:01.540]   You look like a Muron.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:02.500]   Look like a Muron.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.620]   There you go.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:04.660]   Go with X respect.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.380]   E-spect Ray.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.060]   He's...
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:07.700]   I'll just...
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.100]   I'll just...
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.380]   So, they sent me one in my hotel when I was in New York.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:12.660]   And I wore it on the trip back.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:13.540]   And I kept just...
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:16.660]   It's like that Jackie Chan movie
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:19.060]   where he accidentally gets this super secret tuxedo
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.780]   and he keeps discovering new features of it as he goes.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.140]   So, I'll just show you one thing.
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:26.100]   First of all, let's just focus on this pocket here.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.700]   Now, first of all, it's got that cool,
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:30.900]   separate little well just for your special pen.
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.820]   So, they don't all this rattle rounds.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:34.660]   That's cool feature number one.
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:35.460]   Yes.
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.380]   And now, of course, it is big enough
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:40.420]   so that you can hold your iPhone in it.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.700]   That's cool feature number two.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:42.580]   Yes.
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:46.900]   But it also makes your Kindle into shirt pocket size.
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:47.780]   What?
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.500]   No.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.860]   He's got a Kindle in there.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:50.820]   Whoa.
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.700]   It has...
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.260]   You know, that could double his body armor if you are, in fact.
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.620]   Yeah, you know, it's right over your heart.
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:56.900]   Right, exactly.
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.340]   Fortunately, my King James...
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.780]   Unfortunately, it doesn't...
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.860]   Instead of the Hitchhiker's...
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:04.420]   Instead of the King James' Bible stop in the bullet,
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.460]   it'll be the Hitchhiker's kind of galaxy.
[01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.020]   Because he's got the galaxy.
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:06.500]   Exactly.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.260]   I know, I've got that King James in there just in case.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.180]   I carry a Bible over both breasts.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:14.740]   So, and it's got these pockets, like these special document pockets
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.700]   on both sides.
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.980]   So you can have your Kindle.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:19.060]   What's so awesome for when you're traveling is that
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.740]   that's where you keep your travel documents.
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.500]   That's where if your ticket and your passport,
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.740]   we can always get at it without having it.
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.020]   That's going to fall around anywhere.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:27.860]   On top of everything else, it's very, very comfortable.
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:28.500]   It's very...
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.020]   There are little details that I like.
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:33.460]   Like it's a button-down collar, but the button-downs...
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:34.660]   I don't know how they did this,
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:37.700]   but the buttons for the button-down collar are inside the collar.
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:38.420]   Mm-hmm.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.380]   Those don't actually show up,
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.580]   they keep everything nice and tidy.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:41.060]   Mm-hmm.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:41.460]   Mm-hmm.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.940]   And as I said, it seems to have the same...
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.100]   Has pen pockets on the sleeves.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.580]   Again, I'm just noticing more things as I keep talking to you.
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:50.020]   And it looks like a fair...
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.780]   Now, yeah, it does look like a sort of a police sort of military sort of shirt,
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.860]   but hey, we're geeks.
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.860]   We need people to have some reason to feel threatened by us.
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:58.500]   That's not...
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.140]   Compared to...
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.100]   ...what we do at the credit rate.
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.260]   Compared to like the Scott Evist stuff.
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.860]   It seems similar in some ways.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.660]   Well, now, I've been in touch really profoundly with both companies
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:09.620]   over the past few weeks.
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:12.980]   I was on TV last week talking about geeky clothing.
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:17.460]   And so, Scott Evist sent me a whole bunch of clothes.
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.140]   I've been wearing those for a while.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:19.780]   That's all I wear.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.380]   I'm wearing it all right now.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.020]   It's all I ever wear.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:29.300]   And what I love about these two companies is that they both have the same mandate,
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.860]   and they fulfill that mandate in different ways.
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:35.860]   501 tactical is absolutely hardest nails, rugged as iron,
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:39.780]   clothes that it doesn't matter if a certain pocket is visible.
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.460]   Sloms is exactly where it needs to be.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:44.420]   Like the iPhone pocket on the tactical pants.
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:46.980]   Yes, it's external, but that means that when it rings,
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:49.540]   you can easily unholstering get at it like in an instant.
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:55.380]   Scott Evist, their mandate is to create clothing that's very, very suited to technology,
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:59.380]   not only to carrying your iPod, but also having access to it when you need it.
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:02.900]   But their mandate is to make it as invisible as possible.
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.180]   They also sent me...
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.700]   Scott Evist sent me their pants.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:10.340]   And they're very deep capacity pockets.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:11.780]   You can get your Kindle...
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:14.740]   The Kindle 2 will fit in the back pockets of the Scott Evist pants.
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:17.220]   But they will...
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.780]   Unlike the eTapants, you can probably...
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:21.940]   You can almost certainly wear these to a family wedding,
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:25.940]   and no one will know that you're actually carrying $3,000 worth of distractions and
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.780]   amusements as you go along.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.460]   The cargo capacity is not as great, but in terms of...
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.980]   I want to carry a bunch of stuff with me and not really tip off that there's
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:36.900]   anything special about this clothes I'm wearing.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.260]   Scott Evist is your choice.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:42.180]   I do find the 501s, they're more durable, and again,
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:46.100]   because they don't mind that they have that really obvious triple stitching.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:48.820]   They don't mind that they have this really, really obvious big pocket
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:50.580]   on the sides and on the backs.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:56.340]   I'm very, very happy to have both ranges of clothing in my closet,
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.580]   A, because it does cover all the bases.
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:02.180]   And also because I'm hoping that by setting one company against the other,
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:06.420]   I'm only maybe three months away from having my own signature clothing line with one of these two.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:10.180]   I'll be like puffy.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.220]   Like Sean John line of geek clothing.
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:13.700]   FGBG.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.340]   4Geeks by Geeks.
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:17.140]   Exactly.
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:17.700]   FGBG.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:17.700]   FGBG.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.660]   FGBG.
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:19.220]   FGBG.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:19.780]   I like it.
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:20.260]   FGBG.
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:22.420]   I think that's good.
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:26.420]   But anyway, I'm shouting out to the tactical shirt.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:29.140]   It's 50 bucks, and maybe for that you're not...
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.900]   I want to fill your wardrobe with them.
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.540]   For me, my upper limit on a shirt is like 25, maybe 30.
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:36.740]   But they gave me one, and I'm ordering a second one.
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:40.020]   And any time I travel, that's going to be the shirt that I wear on the way out,
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:43.460]   and the shirt I wear on the way back on the cruises that we go on.
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.860]   That's definitely going to be my excursion day shirt,
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:49.380]   because I can't think of a better way to be comfortable,
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.580]   not look like a total pig, and yet still have everything,
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:54.500]   access to everything that I need to have access to.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.900]   And I'm wearing my T-shirt that's going to say I'm with Andy.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.140]   So there.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:03.060]   Is it warm or is it for good places where it would be hot?
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:06.420]   They make it in two different ways.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.940]   I'm wearing the cotton one, which is probably a little bit heavier than the nylon version.
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:14.260]   I would guess that if you're in a tropical climate,
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.100]   it's probably going to be a little bit uncomfortable.
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.980]   It is vented, and it does have big vents in the back,
[01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:22.260]   so that perspiration probably won't build up in the back.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.020]   Also, it has that really cool feature,
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:25.540]   where if you roll up the sleeves,
[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:30.500]   suddenly this invisible little strap and loop appears underneath
[01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:33.300]   so that you can easily not just roll them up,
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:35.700]   but also strap them so that they--
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:40.340]   there's a stay so that the rolled-up sleeves will stay rolled up
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.940]   until you unbutton them again.
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.620]   So it's certainly convertible.
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:46.340]   If I was going to spend three weeks in a tropical climate,
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:50.820]   I'm not sure that I would have a wardrobe of these with me.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:54.980]   But I do think it's definitely flexible for a wide variety of climates.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:56.740]   Well, it's nice to find something that's a little heavier.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:59.940]   I have a whole bunch of REI shirts that have all these big pockets
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.620]   and everything else that are super thin,
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:05.300]   and ex-officiato or whatever,
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.220]   that are really, really thin and great when it's hot,
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:09.380]   especially in Africa.
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:11.860]   But I don't have anything that's heavy,
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.300]   that has all those extra pockets.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:16.580]   I wear a lot of heavy ones, but I don't have a tactical one.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.780]   I need to get a tactical one.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:18.260]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.860]   And in part, when you get it,
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.380]   you will realize that, my God,
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:23.700]   it looks like this thing's going to last 20 years,
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.500]   because it's well-built, again, triple stitched everywhere.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:27.940]   Anywhere there's a stress point,
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:30.100]   there's a little dart or something to take extra stress.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:31.060]   Nice.
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.900]   I like it.
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:34.340]   I like it.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.700]   And available in a range of colors from cocky to sand,
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:38.900]   to gray to police.
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:42.020]   I said 5-1-1 tactical.com.
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:43.540]   5-1-1 tactical.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:48.100]   5-1-1.com, where you'll find both tactical pants and shirts
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.660]   for the fully-closed tactical gentleman.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.060]   It's really quite cool.
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:57.380]   They sent me the prototype of their covert cargo pants.
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.100]   This is their--
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.300]   I think this is kind of their--
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:03.620]   because they do build things exactly for police and for SWAT teams,
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:07.940]   things that people need to have access to certain items and accessories
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:08.980]   and not really show off that,
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:10.260]   "Oh, look, what I'm carrying right here."
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:11.860]   So they're coming--
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.260]   In the fall, they're coming up with a new pair of cargo shorts
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.780]   that have all the pockets and the insides.
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:16.980]   You can't really see them.
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:21.460]   And so that I could show off how much cargo these pants could carry.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:25.460]   They sent them to me and they're all ready with the pockets loaded up.
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.660]   But they loaded them up with MTA K-47 magazines.
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.460]   I want you to picture--
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:34.420]   This box is waiting for me in the hotel room when I checked in.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.620]   And I'm unpacking these boxes and I pull out these pants and I'm like,
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.820]   "Oh, God, here's--"
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.980]   I have to go through all these pockets and find where all the pockets are
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:42.660]   to take all these magazine clips out.
[01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:45.940]   I've got like three in my hands, my one hand, three, two in another hand.
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:47.620]   I'm reading through and pulling out another one.
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:49.780]   And that's when I slowly look up and realize that
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:53.380]   I'm facing a big picture window that looks out over an office building--
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:53.780]   "You're--"
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.580]   And I realize that, you know what?
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:58.020]   They're not even going to knock on the door.
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:59.620]   They're going to come crashing through the wall.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:24:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.060]   And that's the last--
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:06.020]   The other tactical piece of this that's always hidden with all these pocketed pieces
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:10.100]   is when you're going through a lot of these airlines as they start to really restrict you
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.420]   on your weight for things.
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:18.020]   Just remember that I know from experience that a Scotty Vest, for instance, will hold
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.300]   about 40 pounds.
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:20.340]   Yeah.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:21.780]   You know that 40 pounds.
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:22.180]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:23.940]   And it's a little hard to carry.
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:24.740]   And--
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:25.860]   Yeah, it's a little hard to wear.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:28.580]   But it's not-- but the key is it's not a bag.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:29.780]   It's a coat.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:31.540]   It's a different definition.
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.980]   And I have gone through Heathrow.
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:34.660]   And the guy said, "You got so much stuff in there.
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:35.220]   It's like a bag."
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.140]   And my response was, "But it's not."
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:37.140]   But it's not.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:39.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:41.620]   It looks like a bag, but it's not.
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.260]   Checkmate.
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:43.940]   It's tactical pants.
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:47.300]   Yeah, you do want to stay away from anybody who looks like he's
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:50.580]   wearing 40 pounds of hardware inside his clothing.
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.660]   Yeah, I suppose that's one of the big advantage of the Scotty
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.860]   Vest because it hides the wires with all your stuff you carry.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:57.860]   Right.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:58.020]   Right.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:25:59.860]   He's bulky.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:00.740]   He's quite a moving himself.
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:02.340]   He's got 40 pounds for the stuff.
[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.180]   And I see a lot of exposed wires.
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:04.820]   OK.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.540]   Scramble trim.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.260]   Hello.
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.700]   He's got a bomb in there.
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:11.940]   5-1-1 tactical, the choice of tactical professionals,
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:14.740]   and Andy Inato for 30 years.
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:16.500]   Wow.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.020]   I want to say if they come--
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:18.740]   I'm getting on him.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.620]   I'm sitting here ordering.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:23.700]   If they come up with a blazer, boy, is that money
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:27.300]   that I'm going to spend-- before I'm even done typing the URL,
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:28.420]   I will have the credit card out.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:31.460]   If they come up with a casual blazer that's also built
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.420]   like tactical clothing, where, again, durable,
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.940]   hard-wearing, and lots of pockets,
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.460]   exactly where I want them to be,
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.300]   I would be more than happy to dress head to toe
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:40.660]   in just tactical gear.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:43.060]   Now, do you go with the law enforcement line
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:44.820]   or the fire EMS line?
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:45.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:46.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:47.380]   It depends.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:48.500]   Which one makes me sound more--
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:49.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.860]   I would say law enforcement.
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:53.860]   It looks like you can carry cluster grenades as well.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:54.900]   That's fantastic.
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.500]   I don't want to even guess.
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.340]   I want to guess the amount of death-dealing
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:00.580]   destruction devices that have been carried inside
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.540]   5-1-1 tactical.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:02.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:06.020]   The funny thing is that it was originally created
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.140]   for rock climbers.
[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:08.340]   So at least the pants were originally--
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:09.540]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.620]   Decades ago, because you got your chalk,
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.220]   you got your cramp-- you got your this,
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:14.340]   you got your that, you got a bit of bing,
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:16.820]   but boom, I was about to pretend as though I know
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:17.700]   anything about rock climbing.
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:21.220]   And I realized immediately that would be a unwise gesture.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.740]   And then the FBI Academy decided to discover them
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.100]   in the '60s and decided to make them
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:28.020]   standard issue for the Academy.
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:29.220]   And then they realized, hey, look,
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:31.380]   we can sell lots of them to cops and fire departments.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:32.180]   Hey, you know what?
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.460]   I'm going to get the jumpsuit.
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:34.740]   I'm going to make that the uniform,
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:35.940]   the official uniform.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.500]   You know that the tactical vests are pretty awesome, too.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.900]   But the jumpsuit is like, all you need,
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:44.260]   and your pants never fall down because it's all of a piece.
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.900]   That's my problem with carrying 40 pounds of my pants.
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:48.180]   Oh, there's that.
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.780]   They just kind of pulls it down.
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:52.660]   And we could sequin like a really huge eagle on the back,
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.380]   just like Elvis.
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:54.580]   I like it.
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:56.500]   Look at that nice turtleneck.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:57.460]   It's just macho.
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:03.780]   They also do-- you can't put like a bullet resistant
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.780]   plate inside the tactical shirt,
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:07.860]   but they will sell you an undershirt that matches
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.580]   the tactical shirt in which you can put a bullet resistant
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:10.900]   plate.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.020]   Oh, that's good.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.660]   Notice that they say bullet resistant, not bullet proof.
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:15.220]   Exactly.
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:19.700]   And why-- and Mr. Alex Lindsey is our resident firearms expert.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.660]   Why is that, Alex?
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.740]   Because it'll go right through--
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:23.380]   Steel jacket.
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:24.340]   Steel jacket.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.780]   Sniper rounds almost like that.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:26.180]   Okay.
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:29.140]   I think anything 50 caliber is going to go through it.
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.980]   Well, steel jackets will go through even if they're smaller.
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:31.860]   Because they're--
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:35.460]   That is one tough consumer electronic show
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:36.740]   when I have to walk through.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:38.980]   I'm going right here.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.700]   Look, they've got fire retardant shorts.
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:48.500]   The legendary message board flameproof shorts you put on
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.300]   before you respond to anything.
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.420]   I like it.
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:53.220]   Although you got to wonder why you'd be wearing shorts
[01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:55.220]   in an open flame environment.
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.620]   Hey, baby, that's just how I roll.
[01:28:57.620 --> 01:28:58.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:58.500]   All right.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.060]   It's my turn.
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:01.300]   The port.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:04.980]   I'm going to do three, not one, not two, but three different.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:07.140]   And I can't show you because I got the camera set
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:07.620]   differently.
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.900]   Three different iPhone apps.
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:13.300]   So those of you watching at home will just have to use your imagination.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.540]   Those of you listening have been using your imagination all along.
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:16.180]   Good on you.
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:20.340]   These are iPhone apps that I found really, really fantastic.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.660]   We've got an update on our twit.am app.
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:25.460]   Now, I do want to encourage you to take a look at the twit.am app.
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.140]   This is a free app.
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:29.220]   Houdini 7 in our chatroom created it.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:30.900]   Really fantastic.
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.180]   We've got an update on our twit.
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:34.020]   As you can hear, I know that's had a little odd,
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.500]   but as you can hear, as soon as you launch the app,
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:39.860]   it goes right to twit.am, which is our audio streaming system.
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:42.660]   Right on the front page there, it's got a calendar,
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.180]   so you know exactly what's coming up.
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.220]   But here's a nice feature.
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.980]   It also has the chatroom.
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:50.260]   So you can log into the chatroom in this iPhone app,
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:53.220]   chat while you're listening to twit.am audio.
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:56.980]   Also has bookmarks to many of the other useful twit sites,
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.260]   all of which are down right now.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:01.780]   I'm proud of that.
[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:06.500]   Twit.tv, the tech.i.labs, leoville.com, my blog, the twit.army,
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:11.460]   the twit wiki, the twit.army.soundoff.podcast,
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:14.100]   and the live streaming from odd TV.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:16.500]   So all, actually that's odd in demand.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:19.700]   So all of that is built into one little free application.
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:23.620]   So anywhere you go, even on, by the way, even on Edge,
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:29.140]   you can listen to twit.am, the live audio stream of our content
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:31.060]   that goes out 24/7.
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.620]   So that application is twit.am.
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:37.940]   Another application that I've really been enjoying,
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:42.420]   recently came out, is called iDrakula,
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:44.580]   but from more games entertainment.
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:46.340]   And it's, I think it's $2.99.
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.060]   Nothing now.
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:49.860]   You don't see the $10.20 apps anymore.
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:51.380]   They're all two or three bucks now.
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:53.060]   That's pretty much the number.
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:54.100]   Thank goodness.
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:56.740]   Because I feel guilty buying a game at that price,
[01:30:56.740 --> 01:30:59.780]   but this is my son fell in love with this game.
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:03.060]   The soundtrack is incredible.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.060]   The graphics are gorgeous.
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:05.860]   It's a shooter.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.500]   I'm just going to, I'll let you play it in a second.
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.500]   Alex, what's the point?
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.500]   But they've really done a nice job.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:15.460]   But it really, it has that gothic feel to it.
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:16.900]   I mean, it's really beautiful.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:19.140]   And I'm up just once I get started, you'll hear the music.
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:22.900]   Henry was playing, I said, it's scary.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:23.860]   This is scary.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.700]   He was, you know, it's like, oh, they're coming at you.
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:29.220]   It's got kind of like a nice nine inch nails,
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:32.180]   kind of doomy kind of soundtrack here.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.540]   All right.
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:34.020]   Let's.
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:36.580]   Let's play the game.
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:36.980]   All right.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:37.220]   Yep.
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:41.940]   And I'm shooting and there's bad guys coming at me.
[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.380]   And it is great fun.
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.540]   And the graphics are incredible.
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:47.620]   This is called iDracula.
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.620]   It really shows you what this platform can do.
[01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:50.980]   It's quite amazing.
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:56.420]   And finally, I've got a game that lives up to my God complex.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:59.220]   You know, I played villagers before.
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:01.380]   The problem with villagers is you're done.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:03.140]   You know, once the villagers, you know, you're just done.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.060]   But this is called pocket God.
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:08.100]   It allows you to play God any time of the day or night,
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:09.620]   thanks to the iPhone.
[01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:12.500]   This is a really cute little game.
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:13.700]   You can create villagers.
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:15.540]   You can make them do things.
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.540]   You can cause earthquakes.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:21.060]   You can you can have bad things happen to good people.
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:23.620]   Good things happen to bad people because you're God.
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.860]   I just it's fun.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:27.540]   Can you strike him by lightning?
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:28.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.060]   Oh, there's that.
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:30.500]   Oh, they're talking about their bad.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:30.660]   You.
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:32.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:34.260]   You can be eventual God.
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:35.220]   You could be a nice God.
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:35.780]   It's up to you.
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:38.980]   And you can pick him up and drag him anywhere you want.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.660]   I just love this game.
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:42.180]   This is called pocket God.
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:44.260]   And I think this is like 99 cents.
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:45.460]   Everything's cheap now.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:48.740]   So three good games, one free, two inexpensive.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:51.060]   What do you laugh at that, Andy?
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.980]   No, no, I'm just thinking about this.
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:54.660]   There should be an expansion pack
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:58.180]   where your goal is to keep people believing in creationism.
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:01.060]   So you have to keep like burying dinosaur bones, places,
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:01.780]   and you have to keep.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:02.660]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:03.780]   Like you have to kind of trick them.
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:04.820]   Exactly.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:08.580]   Where you get like a sort of a little like pie chart to figure out.
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.580]   Here's how many people are believers,
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:12.340]   atheists, and bright in the middle who don't know.
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:13.300]   OK, damn it.
[01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.060]   This is really like if you ever played populist,
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:17.300]   which I loved and black and white, which was kind of like populist,
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:20.340]   I love those games where you kind of you're all powerful, all knowing.
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:22.820]   This is very similar to that on a small scale.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.580]   It just fits right into your little iPod.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:27.300]   Oh, but Leo, how is that different from your regular life?
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:30.020]   It isn't, but I don't like to talk about that.
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.660]   But I just that's part of your perfection, Leo, your modest.
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:35.300]   I'm modest.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:36.820]   Killing yourself with a modest.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:37.620]   I am modest.
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:40.020]   I'm pulling the levers, but I don't tell.
[01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:41.380]   I never tell.
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:43.620]   Finally, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:47.700]   Catholic Slingsie and his pick of the week.
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.660]   I have an iPhone out.
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:49.300]   Oh, yay.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:52.340]   I'm going the other direction because I've had a couple expensive picks lately.
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:53.060]   Yes, you have.
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.820]   I felt like I needed to give everybody a rest.
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:55.460]   Yes, you have.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:59.060]   You know, people for those of you who buy everything that we
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:05.860]   recommend, I know that I've been a little rough with you later.
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:08.500]   So I'm going the other way.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.700]   This is a new application and it's a lot of fun.
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:16.980]   It is a program that just got released called Photo FX.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:19.540]   It's made by the Tiffin Company.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:20.180]   On Tiffin does.
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:21.300]   Wow, they do hands.
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:22.900]   They do high-end filtering.
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:24.660]   Their filters have been recommended on this show.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:26.580]   I think Scott Born made it pick a tune of that.
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:29.780]   Their filters for Photoshop are high-end.
[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:32.340]   What they've done is they've taken a lot of that technology
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:35.860]   and filtered it down and made it something that's usable on an iPhone.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.860]   You can take a photo.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:40.740]   So let's see here.
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:41.700]   I can take a photo here.
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.780]   I can take a photo of Leo.
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:44.820]   Here we go.
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:45.620]   Okay, I'm here.
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:47.700]   I'll tell you if you're taking a picture of me now and I'm
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:54.260]   posting it by best method of pretending not to be an actual photo of Leo.
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:56.100]   So I can say use photo.
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:58.580]   So you can take it with your iPhone, but then you can add all these effects.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:01.860]   So if I want to, for instance, add a...
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:06.420]   Maybe I want to take some fun effects and make it look like it was pencil, for instance.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:07.780]   So there's here Leo.
[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:09.860]   You can kind of see that pencil.
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:10.420]   Oh, wow.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:11.300]   It did a nice job.
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:12.260]   It looks like a sketch.
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:13.460]   Wow, that's fantastic.
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:14.500]   It does a pencil.
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:15.540]   Oh, I'm buying this right now.
[01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.580]   It's $2.99.
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.340]   So it's really, really...
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.420]   We can have it be a little starry.
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:21.380]   So here's...
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:24.020]   Just that pencil drawing alone.
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:24.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:27.460]   I mean, if that was just the effect, but there's tons of these little effects.
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:32.180]   That you can have kind of that glowy effect that you have there.
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:33.220]   Yeah, that's my halo.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:33.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:39.460]   So a lot of these can be...
[01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.940]   There's tons of little effects.
[01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:44.020]   Black and white, old photo, tint.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.900]   You got wild halos, glows.
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:51.300]   Here's what you'd look like if we were actually viewing you through night vision.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:54.740]   Oh, that's kind of that green little kind of green night vision.
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:55.300]   Yeah, that's a vision goggles.
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:57.060]   So that goes well with the tactical pants.
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.620]   We should have shot pictures of Andy.
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.100]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:02.740]   But you got promissed if you want to have a little promissed.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.900]   You have fog and color grades.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:08.580]   And so, you know, for $2.99, it's just a really cool little ad.
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:09.380]   It's a fun little ad.
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:09.940]   Well, I think a lot of people...
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.620]   As bad as the camera is in the iPhone,
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:14.340]   I think a lot of people use it to upload pictures to Twitpick or...
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:14.740]   Exactly.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:18.420]   If you want to get a little creative and have it just be just a little bit more going...
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:21.300]   I know it's a little cheesy that I'm shooting from my iPhone,
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:24.500]   but I want to add a little bit more and make it a little more fun.
[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:26.820]   For $2.99, it's just a great little down.
[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:28.100]   Photo FX.
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:28.500]   Yes.
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:30.420]   And you can, of course, get it at the App Store.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:32.260]   From the Tiffin Company.
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:34.340]   Regularly $3.99.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:35.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:36.980]   Everything's on sale now in the Apple Store.
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:37.780]   It's only $2.99.
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:38.500]   It's out of $3.99.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.020]   The thing that really bugs me is...
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.700]   Now they put it in their icon,
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:46.180]   because they figured out that Apple actually updates the icon of the application automatically.
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:46.260]   Right.
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:48.900]   So they now put on sale in the icon even,
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:50.020]   which is kind of annoying.
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:51.540]   Knock it off, guys.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:55.700]   If you needed a better indication that the App Store is kind of broken.
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:57.860]   That's one of them, yeah.
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:02.420]   I was looking for a certain application in a certain category just a few days ago,
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:06.420]   and I realized that it was just hopeless to just do a search and try to find the six
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:09.220]   results that were going to be actually relevant,
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:12.980]   and then somehow get information about them based solely on the information that's available
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:14.420]   to the iTunes Store.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:17.540]   I'm really looking forward to a huge upgrade to the App Store someday.
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.740]   Yeah.
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:19.780]   I mean, it's a...
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:20.500]   Look, it's working.
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:21.700]   People are making money on it.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:22.980]   There are...
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:24.260]   You know, how many applications?
[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:26.100]   Thousands of applications.
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:26.740]   But you're right.
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.780]   It's not yet ideal.
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:30.260]   It's a hell of a lot better than anything else that was out there.
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:30.500]   Right.
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:31.300]   That's the issue.
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:32.660]   By the way, my two recommendations,
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:35.220]   I just realized are number one and two on the paid app.
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:38.100]   So I really haven't told anybody anything they didn't already know.
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:39.620]   Pocket God's number one, I directly...
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.380]   Questions where they went before you started talking.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:41.940]   They were...
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:42.260]   No.
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:42.900]   They were.
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:43.620]   I'm sure they were.
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:46.020]   I don't think I've had that much impact that fast.
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:46.820]   Well, well, no.
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:48.260]   That's how much impact you have.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.940]   Your influence is retroactive.
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:51.860]   Oh, I'm going back in time.
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:53.220]   Oh, I like it.
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:56.660]   I like your thinking, young sideburned fellow.
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:58.100]   Oh, did not make sense.
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:01.380]   The application that you liked was not the number one best-selling song
[01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:01.780]   in the eye...
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:02.980]   In the eye of the cap score.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:03.460]   Of course it is.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:03.780]   And so...
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:05.220]   They made it so.
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:07.060]   God listened and nodded and made it so.
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:07.860]   I did, yes.
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:09.620]   All right, folks.
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:11.620]   We have had a great time and it's been a long show,
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:13.620]   but I am so glad you joined us today.
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.380]   And I really thank all of you.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:20.180]   Scott Borden signed off because he had his Cylon meeting he had to go to.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:25.220]   But Anionaco has been here from the Chicago Sun Times
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:28.740]   and the Celestial Waste of Ban with CWOB.com.
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:31.620]   Thank you so much, Andy, for hanging out with us today.
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:32.580]   Love talking to you.
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:35.060]   As always, it's been a slice.
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:36.820]   A slice by Fred's.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:40.100]   Also, Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcore.com
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.860]   for signing up for the incredible Guild of Multimedia Artists.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:44.980]   That is the Pixelcore.
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:50.180]   Thank you, Pixelcore.tv for all your fine shows, including "Twip", "Twim",
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:52.100]   we did "Twim" here.
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:53.380]   I know, it's so cool yesterday.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:54.260]   "Twim" was here with...
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:54.820]   Hope we can do more of that.
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:58.020]   Susan Bratton and Daisy and Daisy Whitney, the host.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:38:58.660]   And you?
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:38:58.900]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:01.300]   And Daisy's going to come up again and do that some more?
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:02.340]   Where I'm working on it.
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:03.140]   I think she's going to it.
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.100]   She had a lot of fun.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:06.580]   We put her in the driver's seat for just a little bit.
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:08.260]   She directed the show.
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.260]   She just, well, she just, she had to do a cute,
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:12.420]   she did a little bit of Q&A talking to people on the,
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:13.540]   and I think we're going to do a lot more of it.
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:14.100]   It was a Q&A.
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:14.580]   It was fun.
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:16.420]   And that's the whole reason to do the streaming live.
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:16.900]   Exactly.
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:23.940]   Is the interactivity. That's the whole point.
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:26.180]   So we're going to incorporate a lot more interactivity into the show.
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:28.100]   Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Good. Good.
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:32.820]   And of course, if you want to listen to these shows, the best way to do is go to iTunes.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:34.500]   Search for any of the Twitch shows.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.500]   TWIT will give you most of them.
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:40.420]   I think all of them, there's a special Twitch page, and you could click the Subscribe link.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:42.660]   There's also a Zoom page, a Zoom store.
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:45.380]   There isn't a Kindle store yet, but we could work on it.
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:50.180]   We have a new app, and we stream live video and audio when the servers are working.
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:59.620]   Every Tuesday at 2 p.m. Eastern, that's why 11 a.m. Pacific at live.twit.tv.
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:04.100]   And the next few weeks, you're going to see, we're going to upgrade the video quality with that new Mac Pro.
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:07.380]   And let's hope that's what looks better.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:10.340]   If it doesn't look better, I'm going to really be, I'm going to really be shagrind.
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:15.460]   I'm going to have a good deal on a Mac Pro, only mildly abused.
[01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:18.820]   Another Mac break is Pro.
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:38.500]   [Music]
