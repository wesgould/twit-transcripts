[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, a special edition Mac Break Weekly today, because Apple had an announcement.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Leo Laport here joining us from North Dakota. I'm sorry, South Dakota. I always confuse those two.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   North Dakota?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I don't know, North Dakota.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Are you in Southern North Dakota?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   University of Southern North Dakota at Google.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Sorry, PDQ Bach joke. I'm in Grand Forks at the University of North Dakota, as a matter of fact.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   You know, I love Andy and I co-cause he and I are the only guys who get PDF Bach jokes.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   PDQ Bach, I just really changed it. It's good to see you.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Peter Schickley.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You just gave the Joy of Tech an idea for a new version of the cartoon.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   PDF Bach.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Andy, great to have you. Thank you for joining us.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Andy's speaking in North Dakota today, which was kind of in app timing, since there were a few things going on in the tech world this week.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Well, fortunately, I'm speaking on digital journalism.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So instead of thinking about what I'm going to be talking about, let me tell you about how my morning has gone so far.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   How many thousands of words I've written and all the different media things I have done.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Let me show you.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And all the things, as soon as I take off the stage, I'm talking to two different radio shows. I've got another column. I've got a right.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Wow. That's great. That's awesome.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Good to have you from the Chicago Sun Times and his own blog, The Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Also joining us from Liverpool in the UK, Don McAllister of ScreenCastsOnline.com. Hi, Skye, Don.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Hi there. How are you doing?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Great to have you. I'm doing great. And we'll get the UK perspective on Apple's announcements today.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Yeah, yeah. Pretty bombarded with stuff, to be honest. I've got to take in. It wasn't just a simple little announcement.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It sure wasn't. Also here, Mr. Renee Ritchie, our newest regular, I'm happy to say, on MacBreak Weekly from iMore.com in Montreal, Canada. Hello, Renee.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Hi, Leo. How are you doing? Apple announced all the things today.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Everything. Everything.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You know, I think most of us are saying, "Oh, this will be the little add-on announcement to the September announcements. This was bigger, much bigger."
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Even though it was in a smaller venue, then last month's announcements. Huge.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   One thing after another, relentless.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   So let me run through kind of in order, the things Tim Cook and Phil Schiller talked about. By the way, no Scott Forstall on stage.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And there may be something to read in that. If that's the balcony on the Kremlin overlooking the May Day Parade, one of the generals was missing.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   But before we get to that, let's talk about what Apple did announce. They started off as we expected with a new version of iBooks 3, adding a landscape mode and a few other features.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   We thought the rumor was this was going to be a big focus on education announcement. In fact, it was not.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   You know, they did update iBooks Author 2.0 is coming out today. iBooks 3 coming out today.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   But really, that was it when it comes to education. These announcements spoke to the mainstream of Apple's product line in a big way, including three new Macs.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Now, we did expect the MacBook Pro 13-inch Retina display. We got it. Very thin, 3/4 of an inch, thin, 3.57 pounds light.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   It's a 2560 by 1600 4 megapixel Retina display. Tim Cook said the second highest density display we make.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's going to come in the industry. That's right, because nobody else is doing this.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   It's going to be shipped with a solid-state drive, 8 gigs of RAM, 2.5 gigahertz i5 processor for $16.99.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So it is much cheaper, about $600 cheaper than the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, but still at a premium price for the Retina.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I'll tell you what, let me get through all of these, and then we can go one by one along.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   There was a new Mac Mini announced, very kind of high-powered Mac Mini with i5 and i7 processors, Intel's Ivy Bridge, Thunderbolt, and Firewire.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   They still make Macs with Firewire 800 on them. I think that's more a tip of the hat to how people use the Mac Mini than anything else.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Not a discrete graphics GPU. It's not intended to run big monitors.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's really intended for server closets and perhaps home theater PCs.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   They did announce a new iMac, and here's where the surprise happened, because I don't think anybody reported much of a redesign on the iMac, and in fact it was redesigned.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Still has a big chin, but boy, it's very thin and profile.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   5mm on the edge, beta of a bulge in the middle, but the appearance is a gorgeous, thin display, using something called "I don't know what it is, but I'm sure I'll find out today."
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Friction stir welding, 2560x1440. They say each display is individually calibrated.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   That's kind of a little bit of a tip of the hat to the photographers and other Pro users who want really accurate color on their display.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   40% less volume in this new iMac. 8 pounds lighter than the previous iMac.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   It will ship with a solid state drive or a hard drive spinning hard drive.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   In fact, the base models are spinning hard drives.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   There is a BTO option with an Apple's calling it "Fusion drive" which combines flash with a 1 or 3 terabyte spinning drive.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   The 21 inch version of that iMac won't be available till November. It will be $12.99. The same price I think is the existing iMac.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   The $27.16.99 in December.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Then they kind of surprised people.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   They replaced the current iPad. The third generation iPad? It's the old one.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   There is now a fourth generation iPad. Not a significant change.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Same price. Biggest change is faster processor and a 6x processor which Tim Cook said is twice as fast.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Remember that the iPhone 5 has the a6 and is significantly faster than the third generation iPad.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Forget your third generation iPad. It's now the fourth generation iPad.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   That was a bit of a surprise as well. Of course, lightning connector as you would expect from all new Apple mobile devices.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The iPad Mini. That's the name. It's the Mini. I didn't think it would be called the Mini.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Lower-clacium.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Lower-clacium just like the Mac Mini. It fits in that line I guess.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   0.68 pounds. Tim said light is a pad of paper. It is not a 7.85 inch screen. It's 7.9.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So there. 10.24x768. The rumor was that it would be $329 for an 8 gig version.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Close. 16 gigs. 329. 32 gigs. 399.64 gigs. 499. You can pre-order Friday.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   You can pre-order Friday but the Wi-Fi won't ship till November 2nd.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   The LTE till November 16th. Apple stock price took a little bit of a hit down to 6.24.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   As a result of the news, that's to be expected.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   So there's the rundown. No special musical guest. It was held in a small, formerly a movie theater.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I'm a Golden Age movie theater in downtown San Jose.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Small enough that I think Apple decided they better stream this event for the journalists who weren't able to go or get in.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   So we were able to watch the live stream. We did make a Twitch special. It's episode.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It's special number one for one if you want to watch Tom Merritt, Sarah Lane, IISACTER, and me comment as Tim Cooks on the stage.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Phil Schiller did most of the demos. Nobody, no third party vendors, no electronic arts showing an Infinity Blade, Dungeons 4 or anything like that.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So it was a fairly quick announcement. Considering the amount of material they had to go through, they did also talk a little bit about the great success of the iPad.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   There are now 100 million iPads in use worldwide over two and a half years of sales.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   How many? They said 750,000 apps, 35 billion app downloads, lots of big, big numbers.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Let me start with you, Renee Richie, because of course, I'm more was the source for most of the rumors about the Mini.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Were there surprises here for you, even for you?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I think the only big surprise for me is when we initially heard about the iPad Mini back in May,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   we heard there'd be an 8GB model at around $200 to $250 with the express purposes of taking it to the sort of Nexus 7 Amazon Kindle 7 space.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And it looks like Apple didn't go ahead with that skew. They went right to the 16GB model.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   That was the only thing that surprised me, but I think the form factor, the screen, everything like that was pretty much what we heard.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Wasn't everybody saying a 7.85 inches?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I mean, I thought this matters.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   They might be rounding up. We'll have to measure it.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   It doesn't matter that much. Half an inch.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   How about the iMac? Did anybody expect that?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Yes.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I think I'm sorry, Renee.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   No, I'm sorry. I was just going to say that the Chinese message boards are becoming a wealth of information about upcoming Apple products because they have to make them.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And so, absolutely.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   They're seeing them?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And they posted about some of the internals for this device, and we heard independently that they're going to be using the laminated display from the Retina MacBook.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Right.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So, you put that together with the other stuff, and it sounded like a thinner iMac, and that's pretty much what we got.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   If you've seen pictures of this new iMac, you would have immediately assumed it was a rendering.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And it looks so thin. It's like this is not possible.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   It's kind of shocking.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   It's kind of shocking.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's like it's on screen.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   It's just not a render.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It was a render, probably. That's right.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   He did have one on stage. Go ahead, Andy.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I was going to say it's a pretty shocking statement about how committed they are to design and how committed they are to thinner devices because we now have a desktop computer that doesn't have a DVD drive or an optical drive.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And usually one of the reasons why you would defend deleting an optical drive is because, well, I mean, at bulk, and how it has to make things less reliable.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Well, those aren't really problems with desktops.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   The really surprising thing is that you notice that where's the most convenient place to put an SD card slot that would be like right on the side of the display so that you could easily get the thing in and out.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   No, you have to reach around to the back where the USB connectors and the Thunderbolt connectors and all that of the stuff are.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   That's how thin it is. Not so much. That's how thin it is.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   But that's how committed Apple is to developing just thin displays, thin everything.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So the back of it, as we're seeing right now, as an SDXCC card slot for your cameras, it's got three four USB three ports two Thunderbolt ports in a gigabit ethernet port done.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Yeah. Well, no, that's okay. I was quite surprised because I sort of gave it a hard time on Twitter because it felt to me that it was just the edges that were thin.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And, you know, it's got a big bulge in the back. Yeah, quite a big bulge in the back. But I mean, if you look at the website now, if you look at all the promo photos, the angles that they're taking out as, and I suppose that's when, you know, that's the way most people will look at it.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   They'll look at it from the side off and front on. It does look super thin. But yeah, I think there was being a little bit, um, I don't know a little bit.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Not sneaky, but you know, the way they they help.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It's a beautiful device. I mean, you can't take that away from it.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   And the thing is the amount of engineering that's had to go into it to actually make those changes is significant. And I really thought they were probably just bump the specs without doing the complete redesign until the retina display, without to be honest.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Renee.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And while the welding that you mentioned earlier, Leo was really interesting because that sounds like the kind of welding.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Apparently, that's what they use on rockets. I mean, it's to the point where Apple is trying to make devices so seamless so thin that they're using aerospace technology to deliver them.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And it's very impressive. They also mentioned that the screens are being individually calibrated.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And they're not retina.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   They're not retina, but we knew that they wouldn't be. I think anybody who's done the math, John Gruber's talked about this. A lot of others have talked about it, knew that you can't do.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   It's very difficult to do retina bigger than 15 inches. We're going to have to wait for much higher end GPUs and faster processors, things like that.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And I think Thunderbolt doesn't even drive a retina display that big gets. We'll have to wait for a Thunderbolt 2 before we can get.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   That's right. If you have the 27 inch Thunderbolt and attach it to your MacBook retina, you don't get retina.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   All right. Well, so okay. I stand corrected. We knew that you knew that I met. Oh, big deal.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I'm going to say that I'm back.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   I did think it was interesting that Tim Cook said, for those of you living in the past, we will sell you an external superdrive.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   It's been floppy. It's been totally floppy.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   You know, you remember that Steve Jobs said that the Blu-ray was a bag of hurt. We're never going to put Blu-ray in.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   People, I as actors still saying, "Where's my Blu-ray? I want an HD home theater PC mini with a Blu-ray available."
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Well, guess what? You can't even get a DVD player in these things anymore.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   You have to get an external.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I wonder if Apples is spending a lot of time, money and effort, designing features that real people don't even care about.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I mean, so many of the spends a lot of time during the presentation talking about all these new technical buzzwords for how this thing was put together, how the display is fused, how there's no air gap between this, that and the other.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   I'm wondering if the person is going into Best Buy with $1,500 to spend on hardware equipment really cares about how thin a desktop PC is.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I don't know. I wish I'd seen more value than what I'm seeing in the feature set for the new iMac, but I'm pleased with the price.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I mean, it's certainly a reasonable price for an iMac. I don't think they even really increased the price that much.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Maybe it's a 100-plus more. I can't remember what the...
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yeah, I remember being like, "I've got 100 bucks, 150 bucks," which is not a lot of money, considering that all the extras that you're getting compared to the previous year's model.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   But I just can't get over it. I can't ignore the fact that so much of an Apple keynote has not talked about things that you don't hear the verb of.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And because we did it this way, the benefit to the user is this. It's no, we made it thinner because we like things that are thinner.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   But when you go into a computer store or a Best Buy and you see all of the computers lined up and there's this blade, thin, 5mm, thin, regardless of the bulge,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   computer there, it does draw the eye. I think that that, in fact, is more about getting a retail customer to step up than anything else.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   It's interesting if you look at all the other computers that have come out. A lot of them look like Apple products now. A lot of the all-in-ones look like iMacs.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   A lot of the laptops look like MacBook Airs. And Apple, in a way, has to keep pushing the future of design, or they look like just another product on the shelf.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   I have to say, though, that they did, and I agree with Andy, they do seem to, in most recent presentations, really be focusing on the technical specs.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I've never heard of a knit before. Well, not a knit as a product.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   They're really going into knits, aren't they?
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   What was it thought about? You know, who's who?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   It's a measurement of screen brightness. Well, especially since I don't think anybody has anything to compare it with.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Oh, it's 300 knits. Okay.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It used to be the processor. We could relate to processor speed, but they sort of dropped that, and they're sort of bringing it back.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   One of the really interesting new features that they brought out is this Fusion Drive, which I know it's not brand new technology, and other vendors have had it for a while.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   But without them bracing that and bringing that into the iMac, that's going to be really interesting to see how that plays out and the details on that.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   It's available. I'm glad that if anything else to see a commitment to spinning hard drives, I really wouldn't be too.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   You could only buy a real hard drive during the keynote. They did identify that a lot of people who prefer the higher capacity for lower price to the higher speed of a, of a, of a, of a, of a solid state drive.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And so this is a nice little tip to the hat that leads to people who still like this sort of thing.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   We should point out that the Fusion Drive is optional. It's not standard on the iMac or the Mac mini.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   And what I'm not clear about yet is if it's a hybrid drive, like something like the Seagate Momentus, or if Apple's doing RAID with two separate drives, the benchmarks I've seen for hybrid drives are unimpressive.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Alan Malvin-Tano looked at them at PCPer.com and was, and came away saying this is not a good product. It makes nobody happy.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   But we don't know if, what this is.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   It looks differently because the performance compared to Flash looked very, very good.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And they made a big deal not about it being one drive, but about Apple, intelligently managing where your apps go as opposed to where your documents go.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And they did single out that this was a mountain lion feature. So it seems as though there's a lot of heavy lifting being done on the OS level to make it all work.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Ivy Bridge apparently has a technology. The new chipset, the Intel chipset that both of these new Macs are using has a technology called M SATA, which enables this kind of hybrid drive.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   So I suspect that this is something that is part of the Ivy Bridge chipset that Apple is now taking advantage of.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   The MacBook Airs with Ivy Bridge have a revised SSD model to take advantage of this as well.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And for magical, right?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Magical SATA.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Yeah, I'm just as you are learning about this. So I'm not sure exactly what it means.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   But they're very careful what technical specs they give us. Like they can't really explain retina or laminated screens.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   They tell us about nits and about brightness and viewing angles and try to reassure us that even though we can't see pixels anymore, there are still pixels there.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   They're not cheating us out of pixels. But for stuff like drives, they're still very opaque about everything that's going on inside.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   The way M SATA is my understanding works is it supports a caching system. And so it would sound like there's solid state memory or you notice they don't say solid state drive anywhere anymore.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It's all flash, even though they are obviously solid state drives in most respects.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   So M SATA apparently allows you to use flash as a cache.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   So I'm not sure. Thank you to the chatroom, which is trying to fill me in as quickly as they can.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   And they're increasingly just putting the chips right on the board and not actually making little physical drives anymore and putting them into the old sockets.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Somebody in the chatroom has pointed me to a link on Wikipedia to something called Smart Response Technology. Eric Duckman says this is pre-launch name was SSD caching, a proprietary caching mechanism launched by Intel in 2011 for Sandy Bridge,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   which allows a SATA solid state drive to function as a cache for a conventional hard drive.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   That would make sense. If that's what they're using, that would make sense. It would kind of be conformed with what they described.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   But that would be two drives. Now they had two drives. I have an iMac with two drives.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Earlier edition iMac with a solid state drive and a spinning drive. So that's not undoable.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   What I would like to look at is the slide, I don't know if you could find it, the slide that he showed during the presentation of the internals of the new iMac,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   because that would tell us probably something about whether it had the capability of doing two drives.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I think I was.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   What Harrison says is the same as Ready Boost and Windows, I don't know. Now the cache in Intel's SRT is a maximum 64 gig, so maybe it is not the same.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   I don't know. I fix it. It's going to have to do a tear down. That's the bottom line.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   By the way, I could see Kyle Wiens of iFix it. Spinning in his grave is Apple touted the recyclability, the EP certification on this new retina MacBook,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   and presumably on the iMacs as well. It's his opinion that these are the most unrecyclable computers ever.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   He's not he's not did not spinning in his grave spinning in his air on chair. Pardon me.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   So if you're interested, I do have the screen capture of the internals of the iMac.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   It specifically has two different call outs, one for up to three terabyte hard disk drive, and that's like up on the left hand side.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   On the right hand side, it's a separate plug in saying up to 768 gigabytes of flash.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   There you go.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   It seems as you get the idea that they actually have separate docs for the fix and spinning in the electron.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And there you go. That would make it consonant with that Intel technology.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   So I think that's probably there it is. That's what they're using.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   So there's a section on the motherboard, in fact, that is where the flash is stored.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Wow. I mean, it's a beaut. I have to say it's beautiful, the new iMac.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   But Renee Richie, you said you, then by the way, all right, we're going to have to do a poll.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Who bought anything? Renee, you said you've already bought the 13 inch MacBook Pro retina.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Yeah, immediately. I made a mistake and I waited for the 15 inch and I had to wait 30 days to get it.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   So this one I pounced on immediately.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   You have a 15 inch already?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Are you giving that to somebody or you just want both?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Well, the 15 inch totally, I don't use my air anymore. I don't use my Thunderbolt to play anymore.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   I just use that computer, but it's a little bit big and heavy.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And especially if you have to travel to shows and do things like that.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   It's a little bit, well, it's more weight than I'm used to carrying around.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   So the 13 inch, it looks like a really good blend of the two.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Now you're making me want to buy one.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   But you did suggest and the one I'm tempted is this new iMac looks gorgeous.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I just can see it on my living room on my desk.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   But you say don't get the new iMac because you think that probably next year they'll do retina displays,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   you know, cinema displays, maybe not retina, but cinema displays on this form factor as well.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   The last year I bought the iMac to use as a display from my Mac Pro.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   That's a step out.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And I swore I would never do that again.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Great, you're that.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   So I'm waiting this time. I'm not going to buy the iMac as a display.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Now here's my question.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Phil Schiller called this new iMac a serious computer quad core Ivy Bridge processor 32 gigs of RAM at Macs.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Nvidia Kepler dedicated graphics.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   This SSD hybrid fusion drive.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Is this the Mac Pro now?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Or is it, you know, they, Tim did imply that in 2013 he didn't play it today.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   But he hasn't told people in emails that in 2013 they'll be a new Mac Pro.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   But boy, it sure doesn't feel like it.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Yeah, I don't think so because when he, the first of those really public emails came when they were talking to someone who was
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   deeply IT or like deeply graphic designer, the people who don't really want an iMac no matter how powerful it is,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   where what they really want or they want rails, they want drive bays, they want a big box that they can then fill with whatever specific peculiar hardware needs they have.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   So until Apple can really get those Thunderbolt bus devices in large quantity and large diversity,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   I think we're going to see a Mac Pro next year.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I don't think it's time for them to kill it yet.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   I mean, look at what's happening on the Hackintosh Mac message boards.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   It's almost become like a legitimate alternative now to build your own tower Mac and they're people who are just so frustrated because they do need this sort of expandability and they have no idea when Apple's going to be actually making one.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And so that's why they're building their own from scratch using PC components.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I think that alone tells you that there is a lot of people for whom the iMac and the Mac Book Retinas aren't really doing it for them.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   So you think somebody in the chat room says he says it'll be third quarter 2013 before we see the Ivy Bridge EP microprocessors designed to do that Andy.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Third quarter.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   That's going to be a while.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And I don't know how important a market it is to Apple anymore, but I presume that they're going to honor their energy and do it.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   It wasn't this like the first time I can remember we heard mention even mention of Mac OS server in today's event.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And it was only because they're talking about the top level Mac mini which ships in server configuration because people who really do need that extra performance, people who do need that closet grade Mac are now buying Mac minis.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I think it looks like this thing has the firework board.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Sorry.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   I was just going to say that I think another limiting factor is the availability of thunderbolt peripherals.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   I mean by now I really would have expected to see a whole wealth of peripherals.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And that was always the my consideration when they when they would rejig the Mac Pro they sort of lose the built in expandability because everything would be ring on thunderbolts.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   It's not quite there yet.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   There's still you know the still the peripherals although we're seeing more and more that ecosystem hasn't exploded as I thought it might have been by now.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   So probably still you know a little while before that can happen.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   We're talking about Apple's announcements where there's still a lot more to talk about and we will continue Don McAllister's here screencasts online.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Don how many talks are you doing on the geek cruise in two weeks?
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   I'm doing seven ninety minutes.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   How you doing on the prep time?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Well, well and I've had to do six weeks worth of screencasts online shows in advance as well.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Me too.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   They're all done.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   So this week is is Mac mania week so I'm actually I'm half I've done the skeletons of all the second and now I'm going through about half way through you know putting the.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Are you going on Australia earlier you're going to you're not.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   We're actually getting there when we're traveling on the second which is the day the new iPad mini comes out.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   So I delayed my flight to the fourth so that I can have a mini on the boat.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   I knew I knew.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   I'm going to be at the Apple store eight o'clock in the morning on the second and then we fly on five o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   So I should I should be able to take one with you.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   I'll have something to play with and they do say ten hours battery life so you'll be able to get to.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Yes.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Great.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   So I'll be able to carry on and I deliberately did my keynotes both on the iPad and also on the Mac because I knew I'd be on that twenty hour journey.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Still do a Macchino present.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And I know Don I've put you delegated you to plan the tweetups of the meetups for Sydney.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Yeah well that's actually some guys some guys in Australia actually are kindly arranging that for us.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   I'm not the venue was it yet but it looks as though it's going to be the sixth the afternoon of the six will probably have a meetup in Sydney.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   I'm not sure if we'll be able to do anything in Brisbane because we're only in there for the day and we're in and out of Brisbane.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   But yeah the Sydney one should be going ahead and assume I've got some information on that.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Well I'm going to I'm going drinking in Brisbane so I'll let people know where you can find me.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I don't think I have an excursion plan for Brisbane so I'll just my excursion will be to the local pub.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Oh there you go.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Well we're there from with their old day and we don't leave till six so you have an afternoon drinking in Brisbane.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   I'll never forget seeing Chris Breen and a few other people we were in St. Petersburg on one of these things and they're literally saying the captain's on the loudspeaker saying we're going to leave.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   They were pulling they pulled up the gangplanks and I see Chris Breen in the distance running the three they top defense they're running because the boat's going to sail without them because they don't wait I mean if you're not there you know so I imagine myself and Brisbane doing the same thing.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   By the way Chris did make it.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   We were standing on the rail laughing at him and they put they put out a plank like they lower a plank.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Come on get out of here. What are you doing? Get in here you crazy Mac maniac.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Also with us Renee Richie from imore.com.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Are there any more rumors are we done?
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   I hope so Leo we need a vacation.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   It's just it's been a crazy I think one of the most densely packed falls I've ever seen for Apple.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Every single product in the product line except the Mac Pro has been updated now in the period of a month.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Also Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times who is in North Dakota speaking.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   What are you talking about digital media digital journalism?
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Yeah it's a three day conference on like digital media and arts here at the University of North Dakota.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   I'm talking about my big my biggest spotlight moment today is digital journalism.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So that's why I'm wearing my official like digital like cup reporter V next player.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   They don't let you they don't let you wear this until we got five years with the experience with colonists.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   It's a it's a I thought I give the kids something to dream about.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Couple more years you'll be able to get the Jimmy Olsen bull tie and you'll be set boy.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Our show our show today brought to you by our friends that go to meeting from Citrix.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Boy even more exciting now because go to meeting on the iPad mini now we're talking.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   We're talking light we're talking you know you can get work done anywhere you go.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   I really believe that be successful in business you got to meet regularly with your team.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   I tried not meeting with my team for about three years.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I even I I saw those people in the hall so we finally decided we should probably have staff meetings.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Problem is staff's never anywhere you want them to be.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   We've got people all over the place but you got to get together.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   It's the best way to share ideas to get new ideas to create to collaborate.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And of course if you're doing sales you know you can't make your client come to you
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   and you may not be able to always go to your client.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   That's why I go to meeting is so great especially now with HD faces because not only can you collaborate screen share
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   show them the PowerPoint of the keynote presentation but you can also see them and they can see you
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   with high quality HD video and that really makes a huge huge difference.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   There's big news now they've just added the ability to host I am so excited.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Previously you had a user Mac or PC host from a desktop you can now host meetings on go to meeting
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   from an iPad or even an iPhone.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   So now you can literally have a meeting from your iPhone.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   The HD faces I don't know if they've added the camera for the iPhone but they do have the camera for the iPad
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   which means you can be anywhere you can be in a cruise ship and join meetings launch meetings share your screen share your face.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   It's so important in sales to see and for your client to see you to build report to build trust.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Try I want you to try this free for 30 days if you've got an iPad now especially an iPhone.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Works with by the way Dropbox or share file on the iPad so you can share files.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It's got the highlighter the whiteboard capabilities on the iPad so you can draw.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   It's really fantastic.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Go to meeting.com here's the deal click the try it free button and use our promo code Mac break and you've got 30 days free to try it.

[00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Go to meeting.com from Citrix go to meeting.com use the promo code Mac break.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Let's see here.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Gosh it was so much to talk about now of course all the gadget blogs and everybody's just going crazy with different takes.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   I'm actually I'm pleased I think we're the first people to really identify with this fusion hybrid drive in the eye Mac.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Are they offering that in the new 13 inch retina?
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   I don't think so or maybe they are.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   No that's the only.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   To me.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   So on it's a $250 premium price over the standard drive.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   I'm not sure they got that from this.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   That's not bad given that you're getting 128 gigs of extra solid state drive.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   You need the chips in the MacBook Air to do the power nap though so they can't go to a discrete drive in those devices anymore.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   That's right.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   That's right power napping is available now in the retinas and the ears.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   That means that your while your laptop shut down or shut not shut down but shut it will continue getting email and updated self and so forth.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   I'm also watching tweets from people in the demo event Dave Morin says well you've got to see this new Mac mini.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   It's gorgeous.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   As usual with Apple technology seeing is sometimes believing.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Sometimes people get have different opinions when they actually held the device.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   I'm anxious to help the new iPad the iPad mini.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Let's talk a little bit about that.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   First of all any surprise that they called it the mini.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   I was.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Yeah I did a blog post today I sort of went out on a limb and said now they're just going to call it the iPad.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   That's what I said to Don.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I'm with you.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   I thought well they don't say MacBook all different things.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   It's different sizes right.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   They have the MacBook Pro 13 or 15.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   It's one of those things though.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Everyone has called it the iPad mini since it's been rumored about so I think it's just something that's stuck and there we go.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   So you can't be right all the time.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   I hope you guys went to Gazelle and got your price on the iPad three because there is no more iPad three.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   That blew my mind.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I was filling my head with conspiracy theories immediately like do they because all my inbox for the past three or four weeks has been filled with Windows 8 machines like hybrid machines that are convertible between tablet and keyboard.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   So they fuse together to a nice notebook.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   The typical specs I've been seeing on some of these things are where it's a really good high performance CPU batteries in both the keyboard section and in the tablet section a tablet section that's not that much thicker than an iPad.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But with a combined battery life of something like 16 17 18 hours and a price range that usually hits right into the middle of the price range for the for the iPad that none of these are $499.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   But if you tend to buy LTE if you tend to buy extra storage, you can easily buy one of these windows eight convertibles for 700 $800.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   So I'm wondering if there was a preemptive strike against some of these cheaper tablet like devices.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   I would I think that Microsoft would like to tell themselves that this is a sign that Apple's running scared about Microsoft surface which also launches this week.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   But overall, as an Apple guy, my last thought was, Oh, man, I can't I really I wonder if this signals that they've got something really huge planned for the traditional next year early season iPad release.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   If they're willing to do their conventional bump up all the specs of everything and released for the same price upgrade in October instead of in March or or or May, what are they going to be doing in March or May that's going to be so distinct from this that they were they're able to simply say
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   we're not we're not we'll just we'll just get this out there and grab more sales in October.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Let's be getting the press release. Yeah, let's let's look at the menu and then we can go on about this.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   I so the many the many is my fault.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   I brought it up, but but I do want to finish the many before we move on to the shock and awe.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   The many is interesting in design. It looks a little bit like an iPhone 5. It has that beveled edge all the way around the white mini will have a silver beveled edge.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   The black mini will be black and slate again like the iPhone.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Also, you might note if you look at the pictures, a much narrowed bezel on the left and right Johnny.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   I've talked about that in the video saying you need to be able to hold it with one hand. So we did that.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Because if you try to hold it with two, you'll accidentally turn pages.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Well, that's the question is what happens because you are holding it on this thin bezel.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Your thumb is inevitably going to overlap. According to Mac stories.net, the software and iOS has been tweaked to notice inadvertent clicks along those edges,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   which is probably necessary. I imagine they brought the design in and they tried it and said, whoa, those pages keep turning.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   That was the first thing everybody others. Yeah.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Unless you want to go ahead.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   I was going to say, if you put the iPad and then the iPad mini and then the iPod touch next to each other, you'll see the bezel shrinks almost at a relative scale between those three devices.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And this really has the same body as the new iPod touch same beveled edge, same unibody construction, same aluminum finish.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And they just made the bezel relative to the size that you need to hold the weight is more about the weight than the size.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   You really only need one hand. It's so light to hold it up. You don't need to worry about the giant thumbs on the side.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   I think another thing is.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Go ahead.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   I think another thing as well is the physical size of the screen because they haven't gone with a 16 by nine screen.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   So to compare it with it and they did. And again, it was another surprise to me in the keynote that they actually did.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   So clearly compare it with an X7.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   I can't remember them ever done doing such a direct head to head comparison with the competitor.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Yeah. But you can see there from the size 60 by nine aspect to keep the iPad, the mini and iPad mini relatively narrow.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   The only option they had with a four by three screen was to reduce those bevel sides.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   And I think it's a bit of a masterstroke really because they can still make it so that it's literally the same size as the Nexus 7.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   They'll get a huge increase in relative screen size in the same physical device.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   I think they showed them off side by side. At least when the minute I saw that, I thought, oh, it's going to be more expensive because there's no need to show them side by side unless you're justifying why yours is going to cost more than theirs.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   But you also noticed that wasn't that kind of weird where it's clearly the Nexus 7 that they're showing off and clearly the Nexus 7, they're comparing it to.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   But they just say, oh, an unidentified and top tablet.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   That's selling Android. Which by the way is not new. You know, it's five months old and we fully expect Google to announce an update on Monday.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   So it's a little unfair to say, hey, here's what they're doing.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   However, I think the comparisons were apt. One thing he should have mentioned, he didn't mention, is that the Nexus 7 does not even have a camera and only has a front-facing camera.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   The build qualities are surprisingly different.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, that's clear.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   And that leads to the question, is the price right for the mini? If you compare, it's only, what is it, as 350 for a 16 gig?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   329 is a really odd price for Apple. I mean, that's usually the 3D price. 329. Yeah.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   And the Nexus 7 is what, 250 for a 16 gig? Yeah.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   So that's what, 70 bucks? That's not a huge premium.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Well, no, it is. It is. I mean, a lot of people aren't going to be seeing it as 16 gigabytes at a slightly lower price. They're going to be looking at as $199 as the most affordable Nexus 7.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   And remember, we still have the Kindle HD to look at. I think that with a gap of $130 between these two devices, I don't think that it's a, I don't think that it's a fatality of any kind for the iPad Mini.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   I'm sure this is going to do gangbusters numbers on it. But I think that breathes new life into this category of $200 Android tablets.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   If Apple had sold it for $240.49, that would have caused immense problems for Google.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Right now, they're, they've really pretty firmly allowed all these other companies to say that we are the affordable content driven tablet device. We don't care about developing something that's truly post PC.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   We know you just want to read books. You just want to watch movies. You just want to Facebook from your device. And we're giving you the affordable option.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Yeah. And one thing he did, he left out of the comparison, which you might want to throw in is that the iPad Mini is 1024 by 768.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   It is a much lower resolution than a Kindle. I'm sorry, the Nexus 7 and a much lower dot branch. The Pixel's branch on the new Mini is only 162. It's far from retina.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   The advantage though, is that they're going to sell this in 90 countries where the Kindle and the Nexus are going to be in so much.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Like the Kindle, they literally cannot sell anywhere without an Amazon content store, which is only a handful of countries still.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Right.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Go ahead. Just to make a comment on, we've talked about build quality before, where they also pointed out that how much nicer constructed the iPad Mini is where it's an all aluminum enclosure.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   But if you take a look at a Nexus 7, I mean, there's nothing cheap looking about this. It does have a plastic back. But if you actually pick up and hold it, it makes it like grippier and less slippery.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Well, and you can remove it and put a new battery into, which is nice. You can. Can you? Yep.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Okay. I've never pulled it apart that way. But it gets back to the idea that are people walking into the store and thinking, "I hope that I can buy one that has a elegant, unibody, aluminum design."
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   I'm not sure if people really, especially if they're, I'm sure they much rather have $130 in their pocket or better yet $130 to buy apps with and content with, then aluminum back, they probably aren't going to really even notice exists.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   I think it's just two different markets. And I think Apple is very clearly positioning itself in the market for people who value design. I mean, that's obvious, right?
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   You don't put Johnny Ivan, the heavenly room, and have him expound every time, unless you're saying, "Look, we've got the best designer in the world."
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   And if people care more about, there's people who care about dollars and there's people who care about design, and, you know, B&O turntables have never worried about the price.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   It's always a bit about the design. And maybe Apple's just saying, "Look, we're the design driven company. If you want beautiful, you're going to pay a little more."
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And I don't... Now, you're right, Andy. People are comparing the 8 gig, Nexus 7 to the 16 gig iPad mini. But if you compare app, you know, something a little closer, 16 gig.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   It's only $70 difference. Is that such a big difference?
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   The psychology is strange because when you go over, if they had done this at 99 and not had gone over to the 29, I think just mentally, it's a huge difference. People would have seen it as still a relatively low price, but 3.29 ends up being that odd dollar amount.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   It is a weird number, isn't it?
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   And I thought it was important that, you know, Tim Cook spent... No, sorry, Phil Schiller spent some time talking about the apps because that...
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   At least my understanding is that Apple's key differentiator that Google, Amazon, to quote Ryan Block, is still not a tablet.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   It's a media... Consumer media device. It doesn't run a lot of tablet software yet. Google is still struggling to get tablet software deployed. They're going to be putting a lot of time and effort into it.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   But the Nexus 7 still runs, to me, more like iPod touch software than tablet software. And every single one of those umpteen thousand iPad apps, including the Citrix stuff that you showed off, is going to run on an iPad.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   And that kind of software, that class of software, will be a differentiator to some people in the market.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   It's a lot thinner to this. Go ahead.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   I think that what we've hit upon is that Apple really... I do believe that Apple believes that there are two different markets for smaller tablets, and they are specifically going for people who want a smaller version of an iPad, as opposed to people who wish the iPad were better as a content device.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   I think that I was surprised by some of the direct comparisons. I thought some of them were kind of... Oh, I don't know, a little snake oily saying, "But look, if we delete all of the user interface elements from the Chrome browser, now suddenly our screen is 181% larger than the screen on the next..." Oh, did I say "neck" is on the unnamed Android tablet?
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   So I think that Apple realizes that they can sell a $329 tablet in ungodly quantities, and that they're aware of and perfectly at peace with the fact that Amazon will sell plenty of kindles, and Google will sell plenty of 7-inch tablets.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   What we haven't talked about is the comparison between the iPod Touch and the iPod Mini. A 32 gig iPod Touch is $2.99, and the 64 gig is $3.99.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Are people going to make the distinction between an iPod Touch and an iPad Mini? Does the pricing make sense? It's a very non-linear, that's for sure.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   I think two different devices aren't they? Are they? Yeah, I think so. You know, if you're reading the market for a tablet or you're reading the market for a small media, you know, music playback, video playback machine, I can't really see that they are completely separate devices, and I think they're targeted at different areas of the market.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   The Touch runs iPhone software. They're both iOS, but the Touch is kind of the iPhone side, and the iPad is the iPad side, so they do run different apps.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Also, if you look at the sales numbers, while the iPod Touch remains roughly 50% of iPod sales, iPod sales keep going down, where iPad sales keep going up.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   So for Apple to have a cheaper, smaller, lighter alternative to a growing product category, I think is highly valuable to them as opposed to miniaturization is nice, that you won't be able to strap an iPad with a laptop.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   You won't be able to strap an iPad mini to your arm and go jogging unless you're really, really big. So it's nice to have that, but I think the iPad they see is more of the future than the iPod line.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Yeah, they did put the same camera on the 5 megapixel camera on the iPad mini as on the iPod Touch.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   It's the same device basically, it's just the bigger screen 3.4 and running iPad software. Right.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   Yeah, I was surprised that it's so similar to the iPad 2, it really is the iPad 2 only smaller.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   We had heard that although it's faster. No, no, it's got an A5, dual core A5, right?
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   By the way, you did not mention that the Nexus 7 has quad core compared to their dual core.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   I know we're because you can't really compare Apple with Android specs because the integrated model versus the separate model.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And who needs quad core on a portable device anyway, really? Right.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   It's quite a surprise though that the iPad 2 is still there.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Yeah, no, so that's the last 30 pin connector device. They kept it.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   Obviously, they kept it as a price point.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   And for schools and education, easy cheap device.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   But they dropped the price on it? What's the new price?
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   It's still $399.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   So $3.99.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   See, I don't, yeah.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   See, the thing just caused confusion for people now because they've now got three different iPads.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   And not just three iPads. They've got six different models within two of the levels.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   And they've got two different models within the iPad 2.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   And Apple's fairly famous for their kind of linear pricing.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   I mean, it's nice and simple and easy to make that judgment.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   But it's quite a complex judgment you have to make now to try to put as the one that's for you.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   And the iPod touched last generation and current generation overlap now.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   So you can get last years and this year is in the same storage capacity.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   And there's a lot more math than you used to have to do to buy an Apple mobile product.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   And this goes back as well to the price point.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   And I think you talked about it last week on my break weekly.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   That getting it below $299 or price to get $299 to get people in the shop would have been what I would have expected.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   And people don't buy that price point.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   But that's the price point they perceive as being where the iPad starts and it's a place to go from.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   And I think that's sort of missed a trick there.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Nothing is going to impact them at all in sales.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   But it would have been nice to have seen it at that lower price just so that it adjusts people's business slightly.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   I mean, it's sort of a tactical thing.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   What they've given Kindle and Amazon and Google is another year to get their act together and get those tablet apps together.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   If they had managed to do a 249 tablet or even a 299 tablet, it would have been a much, much greater struggle.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   I think that would have, that lead time would have collapsed to about four to six months, at least until the next version of the iPad Mini came out before they would have had to demonstrate an attractive alternative.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Right now they automatically have an attractive alternative to the iPad Mini and that is the $199 price.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   So this does give them some breathing room.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   It is important to point out that you can run Siri on the iPad Mini that has an A5 chip.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   So the iPad 2 will not run Siri.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   So that is another differentiator.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   I think the new Nexus 7 is just going to be the 32 gigabyte version and the Nexus 10 from Samsung will be the new competition at the large size and the surface which you mentioned.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   So I don't think there'll be a new Nexus small tablet this year.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   So they pretty much knew what they were what they were pricing against when they made this choice.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   We're talking about the Apple announcement. Lots more still to talk about. Renee Richie's here from iMore.com.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Don McAllister from Screencast's online Andy Enoco of the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   You got a little more time for us Andy?
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   I can give you 15 more minutes.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   15 more minutes. We've got to hurry.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   We want to welcome a brand new sponsor to the network.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   American Express. I'm real happy to have them.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   My goodness.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   The American Express Bank FFB wants to encourage you to save.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   You know, they always say this, don't they?
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   In all the debates of people, Americans don't save enough.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Let's hope we're getting a little more disciplined about putting some money away, whether it's for a rainy day or to save up for something big, a new house, a new iPad.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   A great idea to keep a little bit of what you earn in savings, but maybe the bank isn't the right place.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   The American Express personal savings high yield savings account is a better choice than your bank.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   A competitive variable interest rate to help you reach your savings goal.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   It's easy to link it. It's a digital bank.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   So very easy to link it to your existing bank account.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   You're not switching banks.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   You're just opening a savings account with American Express.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   So you can transfer the money back and forth depending on your needs.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Keep track of your balance.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   They've got great apps for the phone or on the web 24/7.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   No minimum to set this up. No fees.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   And of course, great phone support.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   I've always liked American Express phone support whenever you want to talk to someone.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   It is a great complement to what you're doing already.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Let's set up a savings account for a special event, a new baby, a wedding.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   I'm saving up for my boat someday.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Just add the American Express personal savings high yield savings account.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   FDIC insured from American Express Bank FSB.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   It's a great way to take control of your finances today.

[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   The American Express Bank member FDICFSB.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   It's nice to have it.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   I was looking, I made a change from my bank for something that had really good online capabilities.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   I no longer want to go to the bank. Who goes to the bank?
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   I want to transfer stuff. I want to do it all.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   I want to do it on my phone, on my iPad.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Really is nice to have that capability.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Let us, we got everybody right. I hear a Skype sound, but that's not us.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Maybe it's me.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Have we said everything there is to say about the new iPad, the shock,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   and at the loss of the iPad 3 after what it came out in March,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   announced in January after we hardly knew ye after a mere seven months,
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   not even on the price list anymore?
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Well, surprising to me was that they actually called it the iPad 4
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   because we heard fairly early on they were going to be revving the iPad.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   They were going to put lightning on.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   They were going to put the new LTE chip so you could put it in more countries.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   But I thought they would soft sell it like the Verizon iPhone.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   It's just a slipstream up.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   It's a great kind of, you know.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   By the way, we fixed the antenna.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   By the way, we fixed the heat issues.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   But to actually put an iPhone, an iPhone, an iPad 4 name on it makes it that much more,
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   I would have been shocking to people who might have bought an iPad 3 already.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Are they calling it the iPhone, the iPad 4?
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   No, they're calling it the 4th generation.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   The slides that iPad 4th generation, so they wanted to make sure that you understood that.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   But I'm looking at the website and it's just saying iPad with retina display.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   And they are saying twice as fast.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   They're pushing that.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   That's really the big upgrade.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   It's also lightning.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   So twice as fast, A6X chip.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   This is the first time they've used these 6X, yes?
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   The X is for retina.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   You need the quad core graphics process.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   You can drive all those pixels.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   Ah, that's the X's retina.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   So they had a 5X in the previous, yes?
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Okay.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   And the A6.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   Now they're really pushing the retina, but of course this is not the first retina iPad,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   but it is the first with the A6X in it.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Twice the speed.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Now, we did see that with the iPhone 5, that it was much faster than the existing iPad,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   the 3rd generation iPad.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.760]   Always take a big hit when you go retina for the first time, and a lot of the processor
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.600]   has to go to driving those new pixels.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.600]   Right.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.440]   But they paid that with the iPhone 4 and the iPod Touch 4, so the new iPhone just benefited
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.960]   from the extra speed.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.040]   But the iPad 3, if you put an X1 iPad 2, you could see that it struggled to do the same
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.920]   content at double density resolution.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.520]   And now with this chip, you've probably paid for that already.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.520]   So now you'll get the performance hit.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.720]   Because some people who bought the iPad 3 were upset.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.800]   They just wanted a faster iPad, and they got a better looking one, but a slightly slower
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   one.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.480]   And now they get the best of both.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.280]   So this really is the one you want.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.800]   You don't want to get an iPad 3.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.040]   You want to get this new iPad 4.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:31.520]   Also they're using the new MIMO 4.0 dual band MIMO Wi-Fi.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.880]   Jeff Bezos' favorite word, MIMO.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:40.880]   LTE, well, they had that before.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.880]   All right.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.720]   So that's a lot more countries.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.800]   And again, that's kudos to Tim Cook, the production guy.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.600]   They've shown that Apple has the industrial cloud, the manufacturer cloud, to really put
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.400]   these out in every country.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.640]   It was North America only.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:00.480]   And they actually got in trouble in other countries for advertising it as 4G when they
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   didn't consider it.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.480]   Are you talking about the LTE?
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.320]   So the LTE is now international.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.120]   Yeah, the LTE is now international.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.920]   So before it was North America only, you could get it on AT&T, Verizon, Rogers, Teles, and
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:10.920]   Bell, I think.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.680]   And now you get it on all the countries that you get the iPhone 5.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.760]   It's essentially the same new Qualcomm chipset that they're using in the iPhone 5.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.080]   Is that also true for the mini?
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.280]   I believe so, yes.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.280]   Okay.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.640]   Yeah, they showed a lot of countries and they showed a lot of carriers, including China.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:30.280]   And that's what the Nexus 7, I think, will be getting cellular data because I really
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.640]   missed that on my Nexus 7.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:36.320]   I use my iPad out all the time and I couldn't use, unless I tethered the Nexus to the iPad,
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.320]   I couldn't use it.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.400]   So I really think the small tablets benefit from having the radios.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.400]   You're right.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:45.160]   I think that surprised me was the way it was positioned and the way it was introduced.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:49.480]   I mean, what they spent about five minutes running through the specs and that was it.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:56.800]   But for such a high-level product, it really taught me that they weren't expecting people
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.800]   to upgrade to it.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   It was just right.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.640]   We'll just bring everything into line positioning for next year.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.600]   But it really didn't get much coverage on that entire keynote.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.280]   It was such an important product.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.040]   It was that was quite a surprise to me, really.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:14.320]   Well, and go to the Apple front page because it's the iPad mini.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:20.040]   And maybe the 13-inch Renau, but they don't make a big deal about a new iPad by any means.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.520]   I think that they're expecting people to...
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:26.640]   It's not an instant upgrade, whereas, say, from the two to the three months.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.120]   They wanted to fuse some anger, frankly.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.120]   Absolutely.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:37.560]   We just gave away two iPads and it's the old iPad.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.960]   Unfortunately, we got them engraved so we can't bring them back.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:44.440]   Well, I think it can get them changed if they're even if they're engraved.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.440]   Someone did mention that on Twitter when they had his in the pre-show, so they did say...
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.080]   Oh, well, that would be nice.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.640]   Because we had the line, "We're real sorry about this.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.000]   We had no idea to the engraving, maybe they'll do it."
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.440]   I mean, the iPad 3, I mean, it's a collector's item.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.080]   Now, there's, you know, it's such a limited run.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.080]   It's worth keeping.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.760]   The Apple front is probably $25 million.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.880]   It's a collector's item.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.800]   They said 100 million iPads total.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.840]   That's not really surprising, isn't it?
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:16.440]   But it certainly is when you compare it as they did to PC manufacturers, they are really
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.440]   knocking it out of the park with this iPad.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:23.040]   For a new product category, it's doing very, very well.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.040]   And those are nice.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.040]   I like when Apple comes out, they announce good, solid numbers and they announce numbers
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.400]   of sold to consumers, not shipped, not stuffed in channels.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:35.200]   Not we hope that people will buy, but that's 100 million iPads that they have delivered
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   to people.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.880]   You know, usually we get like 22% of the North American market and we can't tell what that
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.880]   really means.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:48.040]   So it's nice that Tim Cook still puts such solid metrics out at every show.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.720]   Let me just run through.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:57.240]   I have to say this MacStories.net is a very good analysis from Frederico Vitici of the
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:02.160]   ins and outs of the new iPad mini.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.160]   People are reacting.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.560]   I've also been reading on Twitter the reaction.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.560]   People are reacting.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.160]   TechCrunch has an article about how nice.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.200]   One of the things they say is remember how the iPhone 5 felt so light.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.320]   This one even more so.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:21.240]   It feels completely like a demo hollow product because it is so much lighter than the existing
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.600]   iPad.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.400]   The Apple line is it's not just a scaled down iPad.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.560]   We designed it to be a concentration rather than a reduction.
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.160]   So Johnny I've said in the video.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.600]   Yeah, it's concentrated.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.080]   And what is a reduction when you're making a sauce?
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.080]   You're kind of concentrating.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.080]   That's true.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.080]   That's okay.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080]   There's not much of a difference is there.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.160]   It takes a lot of money to build a shrink rate and make an iPad.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.400]   I mean, they're not building machines to make them.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.000]   They're shrinking existing iPads down.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.640]   That's a big sci-fi investment.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.640]   The covers a little they does come with a smart cover wraps around a little bit more.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.880]   Redesign it, but it does have a magnet, right?
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.880]   We still got magnets.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880]   Yep.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.840]   So I have the little flip up thing.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.960]   Also the nicest little announcements of the event was that now we finally have lightning
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.000]   USB and lightning camera card connectors.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.120]   HDMI and VGA as well.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:22.040]   So remember that the other side issue is that this is a bloodbath for the old dock connector.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:26.320]   Now the iPad 2 is the only thing they sell that has the old style connector.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.200]   So it's almost as if it's time to start ordering like you know, rolls a toilet paper before
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.200]   the apocalypse.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.480]   If you want 30 pin cables and accessories.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.920]   Mac rumors Arnold Kim gets a little tip of the hat, a little kudos.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.000]   I'm sorry, digit times get some kudos.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.200]   Remember we gave digit times an F minus on reliability of rumor prediction.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.800]   However, they did predict an iPad 3 in March and an iPad 4 in October.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.960]   And when did they predict it in January?
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.520]   So maybe the supply chain did know a little bit something.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:02.240]   I'd often have excellent information.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.760]   Which company or what year but they have a lot of good source information.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.000]   They have the data.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Yes.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.440]   Jim Dowl Rimple holding from the loop holding it says the iPad mini can easily be held
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.440]   with one hand for reading.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.160]   I think he's a big guy.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.520]   But he says he can hold it anyway.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.280]   Mac observers Dave Hamilton says despite lacking a retina display, it still looks crisp
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   and sharp.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.640]   Josh Topolsky says the same thing.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:31.000]   He says the text on the iPad mini looks incredibly sharp despite the fact that it isn't a super
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   high DPI.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.280]   But 160 DPI is still better than we were used to with computers for years.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:41.040]   It's exactly the same DPI as the iPhone 3GS but it's got that new laminated panel so
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.280]   everything looks much closer, much brighter, much sharper.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.240]   There the anon tech once again doing some great digging posted a photo of the Wi-Fi and
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.800]   cellular iPad mini showing the usual black stripe across the top of the device for the
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.440]   RF model.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:03.680]   They say there is a pretty noticeable difference in performance between the iPad mini and the
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.320]   A5 and the iPad mini and the A6X and the fourth gen iPad.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.000]   2X right?
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   That's what Apple's claiming.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.760]   Boy there's a lot of information buzzing around the net as people get their file their
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.120]   stories as Andy was doing this morning.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.640]   I'd like to see the RAM still.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.560]   We haven't seen any RAM yet and that makes a big difference.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.960]   Will they stick to the 512?
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.760]   Will they go to the 1 gig like the iPhone 5?
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.240]   That'll be interesting to say.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.200]   That makes a big difference in performance does it not?
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.200]   And how many pages you can keep open?
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.200]   How many apps are responsive?
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.200]   Right.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.200]   Right.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.880]   I fix this is almost like a public utility at this point.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:49.080]   They provide so much valuable information that everybody needs in order to do the next level
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.080]   of thinking.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.480]   We won't get a tear down for a while.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.240]   Not till November 2nd.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.640]   So do we order the Wi-Fi Leo and then go and buy the 3G a two weeks later?
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:01.640]   I don't know what we do.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   We wait for the 3G.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   He must be.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.600]   But I'm ordering the Wi-Fi because I'm going on a boat and I need it.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.400]   Are you going to use like some of the Twitter resources to have like some guy like on a
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:18.000]   speedboat just chasing after the craze is going to get me as an iPad man.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.320]   No, that's a I guess you know I could probably get one in Sydney, right?
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   Or Brisbane.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   Because they're being launched in Australia at the same time.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   Right.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.160]   I don't think I'll be able to get one in New Caledonia.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.960]   I don't know if there's an Apple store there.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960]   Probably not.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   No.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:38.920]   Just remember that when that the rotation rotates left to right.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.760]   So right to left when you use the iPad.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   Right.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760]   Because it's the sub.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   I kill me.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.760]   That wasn't even from a script.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.760]   That was an ad.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.760]   You're good.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.120]   You're good.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.280]   I am getting my my surface RT.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280]   I'm so excited.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.680]   My windows tablet comes on Friday.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.680]   Yes.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.840]   I'm going to have all these all this.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:05.520]   I'm just laughing because like I've told my neighbor to if you please check my front
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.920]   ports is going to be a package there that's very important to me.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.240]   You're not do not take it away.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.440]   I want to get you to move.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.280]   What would it take to get you to move out here Andy?
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:21.280]   If George Lucas's office ever said we need to hire a guy to look at every single script
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.120]   we're considering considering our characters.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.120]   I would I would move.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:32.080]   I've often thought that if there was ever a really cool job like involved in like movies,
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.840]   the arts, things like that, I'd be like, Oh man, are we really going to leave Boston?
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.840]   Come on.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.840]   Come on.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.480]   Tell you what, you come out here.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.160]   We'll hire you and then you can talk to George.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.160]   I'm good.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.920]   I'm good at both the mop and that battery operated for buffer machine.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.320]   Oh no, we have a we have one of them wet Roombas.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.320]   It's great.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.320]   It just goes around all the time.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.080]   Right in the middle, right in the middle of the job interview, I've been obsolete if
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.480]   I take that one.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.880]   No, you know, I haven't bought one of those, but I can only imagine what an awful job that
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.800]   thing must do.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.800]   What I need is if ever I have a room in my house that isn't covered with cables and books
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.680]   and power adapters, right?
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.040]   I'm sure I'm sure we're polished like the 12 inches by 17 inches of a open floor.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.280]   I've got somewhere in the house.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:20.120]   Does the Wi-Fi mini have GPS?
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.120]   Almost certainly not.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.920]   Almost certainly not.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.480]   That is significant.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:31.800]   I'm going to have to buy the Wi-Fi one to review it and then buy the 3G one to actually
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.960]   use it two weeks later.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.960]   They're going to get me again, Leo.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.600]   You're going to get you're going to buy both.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.600]   You have to.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.600]   You've got two retina MacBooks.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600]   Why not just get two iPads?
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.600]   I need one iPad for each fret and a Mac.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.320]   So I think we decided Sarah Lane was going to get the fourth generation iPad and I'm going
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.320]   to get the mini.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.320]   I don't know.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.320]   You know what?
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:52.680]   I shouldn't be such a cheap sketch.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.600]   It's just buy one everything, shouldn't I?
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.840]   I've just I've just imagined I want this should be a Kickstarter campaign anytime now for like
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.120]   have you ever seen those like little like portable religious shrines that fold in?
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:08.160]   So I knew iPad full size iPad case with like a hinge on one side and the other side so
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.920]   you can have iPad mini full size iPad mini and just like close them on themselves when
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   you're not using it.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   iPad trifectic.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.160]   Have a three screen setup.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.000]   All the time I was becoming.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.360]   The mini comes out then the mini comes out then the iPad comes out.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.280]   It's the Mothrushka the Numa Trushka iPad.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.720]   I'll miss Olia with me on the trip.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.720]   If I take my I my normal iPad I'm going to have to take the 30 pink cable and the lightning
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.720]   cable.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.520]   So if I get both I could just take.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.960]   I've ordered so many adapters and lightning adapters and lightning cable.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.280]   I spent 200 bucks on cables and adapters and everything.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.640]   First nerd problems first nerd problems.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.320]   Hey you're going to new phrase very richy.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.640]   I'm more.com.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:51.000]   Tom McCallister screen casts online Andy and not go.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.960]   We're doing one more break and come back.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.760]   But is there anything more to say about the announcement before we go to the break?
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.760]   I think you nailed it.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.760]   No iOS 6.x.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.480]   No Scott forest all.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.020]   Yeah well you want to talk about that a little bit?
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:09.960]   No Scott forest all now Scott who is in charge of iOS 6 is the guy who's kind of taken the
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.520]   fall for the maps to back all.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:18.320]   He was the guy who came on stage last time and said the best maps program ever made.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.680]   Do you think we should that means anything that Scott was not to be found anywhere in
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.680]   this announcement?
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.680]   I think it's just that iOS 6.1 is a next year project.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.680]   Nothing to say.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.320]   We won't see him again until yeah until there's something else.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:33.360]   He comes off to show new iOS features and despite a lot of rumors there weren't any
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.360]   new iOS features.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.160]   He's still you.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.600]   You see here next to be with the next iOS 7.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.200]   He's not he's not he's not getting a timeout.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:48.280]   No he's not in the naughty step unless there's a magical March event for some new thing that
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.600]   we don't know about or some updated thing then yeah.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.720]   WWDC for iOS 7 will be his next stop.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720]   All right.

[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.360]   because you know Microsoft thought it would own this week windows eight I mean that's
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:39.840]   a new version of windows is normally a big deal on Thursday they having a big party in
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:46.080]   Manhattan Friday the pop up stores 32 of them open people will get and surface RT tablets
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:51.400]   they'll get windows eight software they'll get windows eight computers windows RT which
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:55.840]   is the tablet thing sold out immediately the surface tablets sold out immediately they're
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.600]   giving they were giving vouchers out but if you go online now I think it's three weeks
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.480]   now we don't know maybe they only had a hundred I don't know how many they made but did you
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:14.240]   know they did their best to just do it created demand for it is this anything that Mac users
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:22.280]   or Apple fans should worry about is windows eight at all significant for me I'm gonna wait
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.480]   and see I was I'm always interested when Microsoft does something different but the inarticulate
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.760]   way they've expressed what windows eight is as opposed to windows eight RT windows eight
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.600]   pro the tablets that they're making the tablets that partners are making which mode you have
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.880]   to use which one is in their attempt to make no compromises I feel like they've just shoved
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.640]   all the compromises and decision making on to me so I'm gonna wait a couple of months
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.560]   I'm gonna see which one you get Leo what a lot of people say about it and then I'm gonna
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:53.460]   carefully decide based on on actual shipping product what what what's interesting probably
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:58.740]   wise and I think boy is that a perfect word for inarticulate it's not it's not malicious
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:02.600]   it's not that they aren't doing something good or interesting it's that they have really
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:07.820]   not been able to articulate what it is or what it's doing or the differentiation between
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:13.820]   different devices I ordered a thirty two gig surface RT tablet with the higher end you
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:17.820]   know typing keyboard and I'll have that on Friday and I'll certainly be talking about
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:21.980]   that over the weekend and on Twitter and demoing it as best I can I think like people on your
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:25.500]   radio show where I was using example of my mom or father they'll walk into a best buy
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:30.540]   like store and they'll see an iPad and now an iPad mini and they'll just choose based
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:36.820]   on size but then on the other shelf they'll see a Samsung Windows tablet a Samsung Android
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:42.120]   tablet a Windows RT tablet a Windows 8 pro tablet from various it's gonna be a much more
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.100]   complicated decision making process for them and I think that I think that makes it harder
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:50.780]   to buy a mainstream kind of tablet for a consumer yeah I have to say that although I don't follow
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:55.020]   it myself the thing that sort of my eyes was the blog post by Paul Therat earlier on in
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:59.820]   the week when you know even Paul said and he's a big Microsoft guy that you know it's
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.980]   just a mess and people really don't know people who should know even don't know what the differences
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:09.180]   do not are team windows 8 and and what you can run with the tablet you know and the different
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:13.660]   types of services that are coming out so it sounds a little bit like they've got some
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:18.700]   trouble possibly coming down the track if people are just going you know it's a Windows
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:23.620]   replacement for an iPad and people might come a bit of a crop if they don't research you
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.620]   properly and from the sounds of it you know people aren't on to do that well and also
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:33.140]   Microsoft really is kind of behind on tablets and behind on phones and I don't think they
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:37.700]   have the luxury of being in articulate I think they need to really they're kind of
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:43.700]   remind me of the San Francisco Giants you knew I'd work this in and you can ignore this
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:47.300]   Don because it probably makes no sense but here they are you know down three games to
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:52.500]   one in a seven game series they had to do everything perfectly three games in a row in
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:57.260]   order to have a chance to win the pen they did Microsoft's kind of get down three games
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:02.060]   to one they need to execute and that's more than just designing a good product they need
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:05.580]   to articulate the differences they need to sell it and market it effectively they need
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:09.540]   to let consumers know why they need to buy it and so far every consumer I've talked to
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:13.140]   is so confused and so worried about windows 8 they just say well I'm gonna get windows
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:14.140]   7
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:17.900]   look at the comparison you go into the store there's the iPad there's not the iPad iOS the
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:24.180]   iPad Mac OS the iPad made by some other competitor to you it's it's it's this old knock against
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:28.180]   Steve bomber that he's not the decider he doesn't he doesn't firmly believe in any one
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:32.260]   thing he doesn't like with Steve Jobs and maybe Steve cookie get the feeling that if anything
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:36.460]   is wrong with the iPhone or iPad he's down there throwing it at somebody's head and with
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:41.900]   Steve bomber I'm not sure how much he uses the stuff and those windows only strategy seems
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:45.820]   almost to find them instead of let them do what they need to do to move their products
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:51.460]   forward I will say one thing though when when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 97 the first
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:58.220]   thing he did was get rid of dozens of SKUs he really streamlined the product line he according
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:02.860]   to the Walter Isaacson biography he drew a quadrant he went to the chalkboard or the
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:09.420]   whiteboard and and and drew a plus sign he said we're gonna make four products the two
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:15.940]   columns are home and office the the two rows are desktop and portable we're gonna put one
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:22.500]   product in each of those four boxes and that's it and he killed dozens of SKUs and I do notice
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:28.460]   a little skew creep here at Apple I mean a significant skew creep they now have a lot
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:33.780]   of different devices and there is overlap it is not as linear size clear as it used to
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:41.700]   be is that a little bit of mission creep I think that is I think yeah go ahead that
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:47.300]   done the thing is with the with the laptops I think it's because the transitioning from
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:52.180]   the the old traditional laptops to the retina laptops we're going to see probably more of
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:57.340]   a spread of SKUs in the laptop it's transitional yeah but that's transitional yeah and I suppose
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:00.580]   you could say the same for the iPad because you know we mentioned it earlier in the show
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:05.300]   about you know that the mini with the six different SKUs and then the iPad the fourth
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:08.620]   generation with six different SKUs and then this this confusion in the middle of the iPad
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:14.500]   too so you know eventually that will go and then if that might simplify things but yeah
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:18.060]   they need to be a little bit careful because that is one of the nice things about you know
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:22.780]   recommending app products people it's normally very easy to ask a few key questions and to
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:27.220]   easily identify the sort of product they want and if it gets too complex it makes difficult
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:33.100]   so choices for people you agree Renee yeah I was gonna say exactly the same thing that
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:37.380]   Don did and it looks like it looks transitional but almost like Apple the new technology is
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:41.820]   expensive enough that Apple wants to keep something at the lower end so the older products
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:46.020]   are kept around a little bit longer and they muddy things up the more the more pressing
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:51.900]   concern for me is just how much product Apple is putting out it's they famously they delayed
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:56.140]   a leopard in order to get people to finish iOS for the original iPhone and now they're
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:19:00.860]   putting out everything at once and no company no matter how rich can really do that you
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:05.860]   can't throw money you can't throw developers even Apple has their limits and I just don't
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:10.700]   want them to start fraying around the edges by doing too much at one time the thing is
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:14.860]   as well with all these product announcements at the end of the year and yeah far be it
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:19.740]   for me to start worrying about rumors for next year but they do seem to do not know
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:21.940]   a full lot in the past quarter.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:28.940]   You can't have that.
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:28.940]   This really makes you think well you know what can they do next year what one are they actually
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.940]   positioning themselves to do for next year because obviously you know I mean Apple have
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:35.780]   got plans 10 years out to the future but they seem to have had it especially with this
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:41.700]   last one a real rush to get these products out before the Christmas period but then it
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:45.380]   makes you think you know are they going to completely revamp their strategy for next
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:51.020]   year so yeah I'll be very surprised if we see a new iPad or you know the traditional March
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.420]   launch for the new iPad I think that's dead and gone I don't think that's going to happen
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:58.860]   so you know you think they'll launch iPads in October now this is now the October.
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:02.300]   Yeah you know and where did they you know and the max have all been released in the
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:07.940]   past few past quarter so what are they going to release in you know October next year.
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:12.740]   What was interesting is previous years we heard and other people at Don Gruber MGC Gler
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:17.500]   heard that the new iPads were ready in in the September period the retina one was ready
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:22.860]   in in September the iPad two is ready in September and Apple held off delayed them until March
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.100]   to keep those different product cycles going and this year that was my thought too as we
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:30.620]   heard the new iPad was ready but you know Apple has delayed them in the past maybe they'll
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:34.940]   delay them in the future and they didn't it sounded almost like that grizzled old president
[01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:39.540]   or admiral on the deck of the aircraft carrier saying clear my skies and they just threw
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:43.940]   everything out shot fire everything and that's what we got this year.
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:48.140]   Well there's no question now we this is it the pipeline is empty everything Steve Jobs
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:54.220]   probably touched is done is shipped is out and it's now clearly the post it's the Tim
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:59.540]   Cook era and we'll see you know what that brings we can only we can only guess at this
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:03.460]   point I mean it's just begun in effect.
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:06.900]   Any surprise they didn't mention the new iTunes they've announced it last month.
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:11.700]   Yeah I thought that would appear today but my Twitter is alive when people wait and get
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:15.660]   suddenly to suddenly appear so it might just be released overnight or something if they
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:16.660]   didn't mention it.
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:23.060]   What day was it supposed to come out was it just said October something someday which
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:30.900]   means October 31st at Halloween yeah and Zinga very wisely decided to shut down its Boston
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:35.820]   office and lay off a hundred employees from the villain bingo teams in Austin during the
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:41.220]   Apple keynote figuring no one would notice and they almost got away with it.
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:44.540]   Zinga's just really struggling.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:49.700]   That's a good time though if you want to announce grim news do a during an Apple event almost
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.100]   political like savvy.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.860]   Some bad news I'm going to go through some of the other stories before we get to your
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:59.900]   picks of the week I should have asked Andy for a pick of the week but okay did he put
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:07.020]   one in the dock I have to look maybe maybe he gave us one as a no as a departing departing
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:14.820]   gift Infinity Blade Dungeons which they showed in January on the iPad 3.
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:20.940]   The iPad 3 died before Infinity Blade Dungeons came out.
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:24.540]   Isn't that interesting I've been way I looked good right here with Infinity Blade which is
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:31.900]   kind of the quintessential Mac app and they you know they've been bringing the guys from
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:38.140]   the games up on stage for every iPad announcement Epic has announced that the Dungeons isn't
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:42.380]   going to launch till next year maybe just in time for the iPad 5.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.940]   Yeah they need that a7x really badly.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:49.580]   You know I might well be that I wonder if it was that I wonder if it was as just as you
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:54.020]   said the retina pushing all those pixels on the iPad 3 and doing all the calculations
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:59.260]   necessary for a game like this just wasn't doable.
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:04.460]   Very interesting to see it that the announcements kind of coincide don't they.
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:10.900]   The other announcement that got a lot of attention in the Mac world was Tweetbot.
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:16.260]   The Tapbot's app that's been so good on iOS is now out for OS 10 we've been waiting
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:17.260]   for it.
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:21.420]   Tweetbot's been struggling a little bit under the weight of Twitter's restrictions on third
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.820]   party developers.
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:28.380]   They had to pull the beta test because they didn't want to use up all their tokens and
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:32.020]   now they say it's 1999 on the app store.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:35.180]   By the way I think it's probably worth it.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:36.940]   I mean it really is great.
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:41.340]   I had been using OS 4 which you recommended Don McAllister a long time ago.
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:46.780]   It was retina ready and so I left Twitter behind thank goodness they're desktop app.
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:52.460]   They've just killed Tweety it's very sad.
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:58.340]   Tweetbot's nice it's retinized it's got all the nice features of Tweetbot on the iOS.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:04.140]   But they say we have to charge $20 because we're not going to be able to sell as many
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:08.140]   because we're going to be severely restricted on the number of tokens we can number of users
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.900]   we can have by Twitter.
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:12.660]   Twitter wants everybody to use the web.
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:17.020]   Yeah there was a lot of upset on Twitter itself.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:20.260]   People thought it was priced too heavily but I think we've well a couple of things.
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:22.780]   One would become too accustomed to get the cheap software.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780]   If you know.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:25.700]   20 bucks isn't much for real desktop software.
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.100]   Yeah yeah exactly.
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.300]   And we're getting so conditioned to paying 99.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:36.780]   99 cents for software that we aren't becoming desentatized to paying the true value of the
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.780]   software.
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:40.460]   And they did have this other factor as well about the tokens.
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:45.180]   And if anyone did get a copy of the beta and they're not going to buy it you know you
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:49.980]   can go in and revoke your token so that leaves a slot open for somebody else.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:51.860]   That's when else does want to buy it.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:56.380]   But it'll be a while before they run out of tokens but they've priced it to sort of take
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:59.260]   that into account.
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.260]   Is it worth it?
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.940]   I mean as far as pretty good and it's what?
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:03.940]   499.
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.380]   Well I mean I use it.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:10.860]   The iCloud integration is great you know the syncing via iCloud between iOS and Mac is
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.340]   the main thing that I like.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.340]   Okay sorry we're running.
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:18.220]   No I was going to say I use it eight hours a day plus every day I've been using it since
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:20.860]   it was in alpha.
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:26.020]   The original Tweety for Mac before Twitter bought it I think was around that price.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.620]   It might have launched at 15 but it was around it's one of the price.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:29.620]   It's right yeah.
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.620]   It's a no it was an absolute no brainer for me.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:35.820]   And I want to be able to pay them enough so that they stick around and keep making this
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.220]   app and improving it.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.220]   And because they have the cap it's an additional factor.
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:43.300]   But development isn't cheap paying full time developers isn't cheap and the Mac market is
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.220]   not as big as the iOS market.
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:49.740]   So I'm happy to invest in software so that they invest back and giving me great software.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:50.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:54.980]   Yeah well I bought it for sure.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:59.900]   But you know ours technically had a very interesting article they reached out to a tap bots.
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.100]   They quoted the blog post but they also reached out.
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:10.300]   And really the issue is that the upper limit on the number of users who can use your product
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:14.980]   thanks to Twitter means that they've got to charge enough to make their money back.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:16.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:22.340]   Ours technically asked tap bots if they knew when they might run out of tokens.
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:28.300]   In other words have to stop selling the product.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:35.380]   And they said well it's selling well.
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:39.940]   And users like us kill it because we all have multiple Twitter accounts and we put all those
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:40.940]   right.
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:41.940]   Right.
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:42.940]   I bought one copy.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:43.940]   Right.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:48.860]   And so that you know that I understand they need to charge 20 bucks it's worth it.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.660]   In some respects as well it's like a pro Twitter app.
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:55.780]   I mean you know I'm the same I'm working at my desk all day I've got it running constantly.
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:56.780]   It's there.
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.100]   Yeah for a typical Twitter user it might be overkill it.
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:04.300]   It might be something that you know they're quite happy to use the web client or the web
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.340]   you know or just the free app that comes with it although it's rubbish.
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:10.780]   But you know if you're a pro user of Twitter and because of all the support for multiple
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:16.420]   accounts for the iCloud synchronization of your positioning within tweet within iOS and
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:17.420]   the Mac.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:21.220]   For the ability I mean it's worth 20 dollars for me to actually mute various things as
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.860]   new times and mute people you know it's it's valuable.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:27.940]   Paul Hadad at TapBot said it was too early to tell when they might run out.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:29.980]   He says sales were very nice.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:34.820]   If you look with the number two top paid and grossing app and pretty much all the different
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:40.220]   app stores just behind Mountain Lion at this time we have no idea when we'll run out of
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:43.140]   tokens we'll know better in a week or two once we can get some more data on how they're
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:44.140]   being used.
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.140]   That's the key right.
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:49.620]   Many different people are you know people are when different accounts and different machines
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:50.620]   people are using.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:53.700]   And some people kind of unfairly compared it to Mountain Lion saying Mountain Lion is
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:57.900]   only 20 bucks but Mountain Lion is heavily subsidized by Apple hardware margins it is
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:58.900]   not a fair comparison.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.900]   Right.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:03.820]   No yeah all right I think I think we've justified it.
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:05.900]   And you know you don't have to buy it.
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:07.780]   The Twitter app is free.
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:09.260]   If you that's good enough for you.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:10.300]   It's a band and wear but it's free.
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:12.380]   It's a band and wear but it is free.
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.340]   Yeah they're not they're not developing it.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:18.260]   They haven't they haven't made a single update to it in months and months and months.
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:21.980]   They've and everything Lauren Bricke or touched has pretty much been wiped away from the original
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:25.420]   author Tweety which yes product bought by Twitter to kill.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.380]   Actually I don't think they intended to kill it when they bought it but they changed
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:32.180]   their their their business model they really want to see those ads.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:36.260]   Well it's also I mean from least from talking to people at Twitter we're not their user
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:41.020]   anymore their average user now has almost no followers follows hundreds of celebrities
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:46.020]   never DMs uses American Idol hashtags all the time and that's not anything Tweety was
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:51.820]   designed for that's what the new Twitter experience is designed for.
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:52.820]   That's depressing.
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:53.820]   Yes.
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:59.380]   You saw there's a competitor feed PHED.com that all this all the celebrities are using
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:05.940]   now because you can charge people to see your feed.
[01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:06.940]   Yeah.
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:12.620]   They're using this Miley Cyrus and what's their name Tisley ashdale tis whatever her
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:14.620]   name is I don't know.
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:16.020]   I don't follow these people.
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.020]   That's me.
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:18.020]   Don't ask me.
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:20.940]   They're all doing that they're putting music up there and charging for it and stuff like
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:23.380]   that.
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:25.860]   I bought I did sign up because I wanted to get my name.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.540]   Let me see if I can but I'm not following it.
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:32.460]   I hesitated because they were spamming Twitter feed so I was hesitant to sign up.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.460]   Oh.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:35.380]   Too late.
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:40.180]   I had to get my name so that Ashley Tisdale couldn't steal it.
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:44.820]   Let's see surface orders sold out in the US some UK orders delayed in November 2nd.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:50.460]   There are three week delays I think in the US.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:58.020]   The patent on rubber banding has been invalidated by the United States patent and trademark office.
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:02.100]   That was the patent Apple was using against Samsung.
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.100]   The bounce scroll.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:08.460]   You know when you slide when you get to the edge and you can't scroll over anymore it
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:11.940]   goes bing bing that's called rubber banding.
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:20.140]   It was one of the patents that Apple won in court beat Samsung on in court a filing from
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:27.540]   the United States patent trademark office invalidated all claims for patent 381 including
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:33.100]   two rejections that claim 19 which was used against Samsung.
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.100]   Oh boy.
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:37.180]   I don't know what that means.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:43.500]   It was an anonymous request to reexamine the 381 patent along with 4949 touch green heuristics
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.660]   patent that brought it back in front of the USPTO and the USPTO looked at it and said
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:51.660]   oh yeah you didn't event that.
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:56.980]   Or if you did it was obvious or it's you know they say prior art.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:00.300]   And a rejection D based on prior art.
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:09.660]   One from a PCT publication number by AOL controlling content display published 2003.
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:14.180]   And another patent by Scott forest all.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:20.460]   Oh what in his spare time you was inventing rubber banding.
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:23.220]   Now he's really in trouble.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:26.660]   Wow that's very interesting.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:30.940]   So I guess I don't know I'm sure Samsung's immediately pleaded.
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:37.420]   Hey judge you see we were right.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:40.660]   We've already talked about what Google's expected to talk about on Monday will watch
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.460]   with interest.
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:48.820]   Samsung some have said is no longer Apple's no longer buying stuff from Samsung but Samsung
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:54.980]   spokesman says that we are not ending our agreement to supply LCDs to Apple.
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:59.820]   We're still giving them panels.
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:00.980]   Apple needs as many as they can get.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:03.820]   That's why I think they went to three manufacturers to begin with.
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.540]   They are severely panel constrained.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:08.460]   Well this but it's interesting about this story was this one was Samsung saying hey we're
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:11.500]   not going to sell you anymore which would be one way you could kind of get back at Apple
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.220]   I guess.
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:16.260]   All right I think that's it.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:20.740]   Let's get to our picks of the week our tips of the week with Don McAllister for screen casts
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:21.740]   online.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:25.900]   I'm sure you have a few you're preparing for your talks on the boat.
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:31.100]   We're sailing for we're leaving Sydney November 7th right.
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:36.060]   Selling for uncharted territory somewhere out there to see a total eclipse.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.060]   That's right.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:38.060]   And then we'll be back.
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:39.060]   Well it's exciting.
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:40.060]   I can't wait.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.980]   I know I know Gene McDonald is going to be on the cruise from a smile software she's
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:44.980]   watching tonight.
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:51.060]   Yeah actually I think she's going to spend two weeks there ahead of time.
[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.060]   So jealous.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:55.140]   Gene you're so lucky.
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:59.380]   Now somebody I think Alice and Sheridan said they might still be you couldn't still go
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:02.060]   could you if you went to incite cruises.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:04.820]   I'm not sure if they've sold out yet.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:09.940]   That would be unusual because it is a it is a total eclipse cruise among other things.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:16.580]   And often those sell out because you know hey people want to do that anyway it's Mac
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:22.740]   Mania 15 the Australian eclipse 2012 cruise looks maybe you can still book we would love
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:27.100]   to see it'll be me Don Allison Sheridan Sal Segoin.
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:33.420]   And lots of great art lectures and solar eclipse lectures from actual scientists.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:37.220]   So you can find out more about what we're about to see that it's going to be fun because
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:42.740]   when you know I guess the ship will look for a clear skies will go there astronomers will
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:47.300]   be on on the PA system explaining what we're seeing.
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:48.300]   It'll be fun.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:49.300]   I cannot wait.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:53.060]   I hope if I if it's not yet booked do absolutely if you've never done a Mac Mania cruise there's
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.060]   so much fun.
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:34:00.140]   You know 150 200 Mac fanatics lectures we get together we're going to do the ingenious
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:02.300]   bar again Don I hope I can count on you for that.
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:03.860]   Yeah that should be good.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:04.860]   That's always good.
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:09.260]   We all go to the crow's nest bar about an hour before dinner.
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:12.620]   And and anybody who has a question wants some help you can bring your Mac you bring your
[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:18.380]   pad your phone and we can talk it's fun it's always fun it's very social and it's great
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:24.060]   to get advice late in that hour because it's often a little bit more lubricated than the
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.900]   advice earlier in the hour.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.460]   That's right.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:31.140]   Renee you're not going with us next time I'll tell I'll tell Captain Neil we've got to
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.940]   bring the guy from Montreal.
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:35.900]   Absolutely I'd be thrilled to be really good to have you.
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:42.460]   Renee Richie from imore.com speaking of Gene McDowell smile software our sponsor this portion

[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:35.180]   Let's start with you Don McAllister you got a pick of the week or a tip or anything you
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:37.700]   want to pass along of value up.
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:41.980]   I'll do well I do a pick of the week okay.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:47.540]   Sure as I have done loads of shows in advance for going away and one of the shows includes
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:51.180]   this little utility which is hopefully it's not been covered on the show before but it's
[01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:52.780]   called pop clip.
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:58.420]   No you see on by a pilot moon basically what it does is you know on iOS if you do a copy
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:01.580]   and page you get a little pop up menu that says copy and paste.
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.780]   Yeah well it's the same but it's on your Mac so you can when you select some text you
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:11.580]   get a little bubble of things with copy paste all but it gets better than that though because
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:15.380]   it was it's been out for a while and I sort of used it in the beginning and then I sort
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:20.340]   of forgot about it really but I revisited it recently and there's a whole host of extensions
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:26.660]   now so it's not just to do copy and paste but you can install extensions so that if you
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:30.660]   select some text you can go straight to the dictionary or you can send it straight to
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:31.660]   Google translate.
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:36.460]   There's about I think there's about 20 odd different extensions that you can install
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:41.340]   you can install up to 10 at a time but it really it's a really very functional very useful
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:45.860]   application now and it's really you know come on leaps and bounds since it was first
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:50.740]   introduced I think it's a it's 4.99 from the Mac App Store and it's great just to do
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:53.460]   the copy and paste but with the extensions it takes it to the next level.
[01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:55.740]   I'm buying it right now.
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:59.700]   You can do things like uppercase words you can do a word count on the I mean it's very
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:00.700]   powerful.
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:04.860]   And what I tend to do all the time is when I'm pasting and I want to paste the match
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:08.060]   style and I'm always having to go up to the menu bar where you can actually put an extension
[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:12.620]   in that does a you know paste the match style straight from the just a slight move of the
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.860]   mouse cursor click and it's done it's really good.
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:18.340]   Really cool.
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:25.940]   It's called pop clip P O P C L I P 4.99 on the App Store desktop App Store right now.
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:31.060]   Renee you want to pass along a recommendation a tip will let your new you're the new guy
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:33.620]   so we'll let you do anything you want.
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:35.580]   I prepared an app.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:36.580]   Okay.
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:41.020]   Yeah I didn't know what tips were on the tables I prepared an app and I I was going
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:46.140]   to pick a different app this week but it was approved today and it's Lauren Brikters new
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:51.420]   app and he very wisely decided that maybe he would see the data Apple news and not try
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:56.220]   to release with all the new product so that's going to come out tomorrow but the app that
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:58.820]   I'm picking today is tweet glass for iPad.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:04.500]   I was a huge fan of these sort of niche Twitter apps and there was birdhouse in from Adam
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:09.580]   Lister Gar years ago in reportage from where cloud tweet glass is just a conversational
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:14.900]   view of Twitter it shows the people that you follow and then the streams of conversations
[01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:20.020]   almost like a threaded list view and it's got a very large presentation for photographs
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:25.140]   so if you want to just sit back on your iPad and read Twitter not quite like flipboard
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:29.460]   but almost like that kind of a feeling it's not an on the go engage it's sort of a sit
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.260]   back relax and just enjoy your stream.
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:33.700]   It's an excellent way of doing it.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:38.260]   It's from Glasshouse app so makes just beautiful applications and that's Lauren Brikter.
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:41.340]   No Lauren Brikter sorry I apologize Lauren Brikter is new app was supposed to come out
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:44.860]   today it comes out tomorrow instead so I can't talk about it yet but this one comes
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.860]   out today.
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:52.660]   Oh sorry this one is Lauren doing that thing we talked about last week that we were thinking
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:58.980]   of using for that's Brent Simmons cloud that's Brent Simmons yes Lauren Brikter is he's
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:01.460]   only announced so far that it's a game and it comes out tomorrow.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:08.180]   Oh that's right yeah we can do a game so it's not out till tomorrow yeah oh I want to see
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:11.660]   it yeah we were talking about glassboard and Chad and I are trying to decide whether
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:15.300]   to use it or not for preparing the shows I think we just decided to keep texting each
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.300]   other.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:22.700]   It's so good the you know we've been writing letters for years now so we we mail them I
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:25.980]   like I need the exercise walk into the mailbox.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:30.260]   I like I like having a full mailbox it makes me look like social.
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:33.700]   It's about a sort of galactic approach you're keeping it really old school so we mentioned
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:37.780]   the tweet bot which would have been my pick but really it's a news story is available $20
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:42.380]   it's still worth it the greatest Twitter app out there although I'm going to try this
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:44.180]   new glass house that actually looks pretty good.
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.180]   Can you tweet from it?
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:49.380]   Yeah you absolutely you can do almost anything you can do with a regular Twitter app it's
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:53.660]   just the way it presents itself is more like a reading experience than a strict and this
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:56.620]   is what kills me about Twitter's new rules is they're trying to destroy the ability to
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:01.580]   make clients they don't want anything on that consumer engagement access and stuff like
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:05.860]   this shows the potential of really good developers that they can still make fantastic new ways
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:08.460]   to use Twitter they were only allowed to.
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:14.500]   Well I so I mentioned that I mentioned a tweet bot from tap bots if you use busy cow which
[01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:19.420]   has been a pick before busy cow to just came out it's a paid upgrade I think it's $20
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:24.860]   $30 but I'm a big busy cow fan as a replacement for calendar on the desktop and we should
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:29.980]   also mention another product we've mentioned many times before be loved by photographers
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:36.980]   has just been updated.
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:46.140]   As of blinks photo magic of four just came out 9999 if you want to make slide shows if you're
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:51.800]   a photographer you want to you know create a ways to watch your photos that are very interesting
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:58.060]   add layers titles music narration sound effects photo magic of four I really love photo magic
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:05.080]   of three we use it a lot and the new version just came out so there's a couple of new program
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.780]   new versions of old programs and one new program for you.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:12.400]   Renee great to have you aboard the Mac break weekly train.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:14.600]   Thank you very much thank you for having me it's an honor.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:20.600]   Yes Alex we're not replacing Alex Lindsey but he's here so seldom that we thought we
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:23.920]   should have somebody who's we can count on a regular basis and Alex will be here whenever
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.960]   he's in town by the way I got an email from Scott born who wants to be back on at some
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:30.360]   point just to so we'll get Scott on.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:31.360]   Cool.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:36.400]   Yeah the guy with the iPad vest I'm sorry it was an iPhone vest wasn't it so well we'll
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.360]   call give you his email will contact Scott we'll get him on soon.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.920]   Love having Don McAllister on to we we are big fans the connection was really good today
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:49.080]   so I'm now encouraged I was a little discouraged we've had some trouble in the past but rock
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.080]   side.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:57.960]   Yeah don and I will be on a boat insight cruises.com if you if and I don't know if it's too late
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:04.200]   I mean do you want to go on a cruise in two weeks for two weeks.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.320]   If you have the kind of person who could drop everything and go on a cruise for two weeks
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.280]   just as a 14 days from now you probably can afford it so do it.
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.760]   We'll see on the boat.
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:16.920]   Thanks everybody for joining us huh I was going to say can I do some blatant self promotion
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:19.680]   now that we've got the new iPad mini and don't think we can.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:21.680]   Oh I forgot screencast online.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.960]   Well no but my magazine is going to be on the new iPad mini so I'm made it with that.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:29.280]   So I sort of predated Marcos by a couple of months you know he's got the magazine but
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.400]   Screencast Online Monthly is on the new stand now.
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.400]   It's A Magazine.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.400]   It's A Magazine yeah.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:40.440]   It's a magazine with all my video tutorials and articles and stuff by my friends.
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.680]   And it's called again?
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.520]   Screencast Online Monthly.
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:47.640]   Screencast and if so if I search the newsstand for that I should find it.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:51.960]   Yeah yeah I'll just say for Screencast Online the SEO 2 Teraps will pop up and this new magazine
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:55.680]   as well it's it's up to issue number three now I think that's been before I've been
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:00.120]   coming out in November but the nice thing is because they've used you know it's a say
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:03.040]   IOS and it's the same resolution as the iPad.
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.080]   All the magazines in newsstand are now going to be able to work on the new iPad mini so
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.400]   I'm quite excited to see how it looks in that different form.
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.720]   And did you use author to do that?
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:16.600]   No I use an application called Magcast which again I've put a video upon YouTube actually
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:21.880]   as to how to produce a magazine from using this this platform has been developed by
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:27.080]   a guy called Ed Dale over in Australia by Coincidence and it's basically I generate
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:33.880]   a PDF run it through the Magcast platform add some rich media and add links etc and press
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:38.480]   a button and out the back comes a newsstand application that's published by Newsstand.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:42.920]   That's a really really clever system but search for YouTube for Magcast or in fact if you
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:48.600]   go to Screencast yeah just search YouTube for Magcast and I'll go to the link for the
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:52.520]   direct link to the video it's about how far video shows you my my work class how to create
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.520]   the magazine.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.120]   And we have been used I forgot you set up a glass board board for the Macmania cruise
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.120]   for the speakers.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:01.640]   That's right yeah yeah and that was pretty neat.
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.600]   I co-incidence actually because I've heard lots of people using glass board on conferences
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.200]   and stuff like that and I thought well this is this would be a nice way to interact with
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.720]   the group because the worst thing is when you're on one of these cruises you don't
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:16.440]   really want to flood Twitter with you know where you are and where can we meet up and stuff
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.440]   like this.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.920]   The glass board seems to be a so like a nice little private group where you can still send
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:24.600]   stuff out on Twitter but you know so communicate with the group it's probably best to keep
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.320]   it in that little environment.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.080]   Well you open it for all the cruisers I guess we could do that right?
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:35.320]   Yeah you can set up an invite people or you can give out an invitation code.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:38.240]   Right so once we get on the boat we'll just let everybody on it.
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.240]   Not that we'll be able to talk because there's so little internet on these boats.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:51.160]   We'll actually have to talk face to face.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.400]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
