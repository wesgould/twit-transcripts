[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.320]   there is to know about Macintosh.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.160]   And boy, today there's a lot to know about Macintosh.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.360]   We've got the Apple earnings call.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080]   We've got a new operating system.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.480]   We've got new hardware.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.600]   And we've got a great panel to talk about it all,
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.800]   starting with Mr. Andy Inako from Boston, our regular guy
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.040]   here, Handy.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.800]   Can't talk writing.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.360]   Yeah, I bet you are.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.480]   Now you've had Lion for a while, so you've
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.880]   been able to work on this, right?
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.760]   Yeah, unfortunately, I--
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.520]   But it's only when I had to spend this morning waiting
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.440]   in line to download it and then downloading
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.480]   because what I had was, of course, the developer edition.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.920]   And I didn't know for sure that what the regular installation
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   process would be.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.240]   That's at least the stupid thing.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.040]   You have saying, well, let's reread the entire review
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.560]   and make those changes.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.000]   Oh.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.280]   Now that we know--
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.000]   what happened?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.960]   Nothing.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.400]   I'm just-- I'm like, I'm exaggerating.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.680]   And so also because now, like, things
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.240]   I was trying to shag down for the past three weeks,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.680]   like, you're sure that you're not going to be selling this
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.800]   on a flash-- not even on a flash drive, you're sure?
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.360]   So I'm going through the list of questions
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.040]   that I reckon that might be answerable on the day
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.920]   of release, but not before.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.120]   In fact, they're going to.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.800]   But before we go too much farther down that road,
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.280]   let's say hello to a new member of our panel.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.680]   We're really glad to have him.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.760]   Mr. OS Can-- can Ray, my old friend from Tech TV.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.120]   Hey, can Ray.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.000]   Hey, Leo, how's it going?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.760]   Mac OS Can?
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.400]   Yes.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.240]   Yes, I'm keeping the Mac.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.560]   You are.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.400]   You're not going to give it up.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.240]   You're dropping it.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.760]   Nah, because that--
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.880]   That could be Lion OS Can?
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.120]   Probably not.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.480]   I might change my-- I can't--
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.360]   Oh, it's 10 can?
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.800]   Kind of has a certain sound to it.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.880]   That gets a little too grimy, though, doesn't it?
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.400]   OK.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   For me, anyway.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.440]   I don't know.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.280]   Yeah, I'm going to keep the Mac part, because why not?
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.720]   Why not?
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.680]   And then when they go to 11, I'm probably
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.840]   still going to be OS Can.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   You're stuck with it.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.080]   Forever.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.720]   You're the rest of your life.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.160]   It's been a few years.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.520]   Don McAllister also joining us from the other side
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.840]   of the pond.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.720]   Indeed, yes.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.760]   Brink has been a really long day for me.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.720]   Did you get up with the birds to get Lion now?
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.960]   Not really, but there was lots and lots, of course,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.760]   being a head all behind you here.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.880]   We're ahead of you, aren't we?
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.920]   So no, there'd been lots of speculation this morning
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.800]   when it would actually come out.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.480]   It actually came around about outrun about lunch time,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.840]   which is probably about six or seven hours ago now.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.760]   Yeah, I think I got up--
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.320]   I looked at midnight last night just to see.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.200]   Nothing.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.360]   I got up at 6 a.m.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.800]   There it was.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.920]   Downloaded it immediately.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.160]   And one of the first things I did, of course,
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.440]   was installing on my air.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.520]   And I was all set to make a USB key,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.440]   because we know how to make a USB key out of it.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.640]   And then I thought, oh, no, I'll just do it after I install.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.840]   And son of a bitch, if it didn't delete the install file.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.320]   Yes, you have to stop at that point
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.440]   and then make a copy and then carry on one.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.640]   Lesson number one.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.560]   If you don't want to download this 5GIG file 800 times,
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.960]   and it's completely legal, apparently,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.400]   to install it on every Mac you've got.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.480]   What you should do is stop before you say OK.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.120]   And then extract the open package contents.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.600]   And you go into, what is it, something resources?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.120]   Yeah, there's a folder in there, resource.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.240]   So I'm going to do a video.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.840]   At the same as Andy, I've had it for a while now.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.920]   But I've been sort of hanging on and hanging on until that.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   He did the final release.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.000]   And just in case they changed it.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.640]   We got a change or something.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.200]   So they did?
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.720]   They did?
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.200]   They did?
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.240]   And then you could drag that to that DMG file to disk utility.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.000]   I burned it onto a USB key.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.080]   And in fact, as part of the fun today,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.240]   I've got my Mac OS X install ESD.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.000]   That's the name of the file.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.320]   And I made a boot key out of it.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.240]   I am going to restart and install Lion as we talk.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.960]   This is the only way to do a clean install, though.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.840]   All I have to say on my air anyway, which is a--
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.360]   you know, October air running Snow Leopard.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.520]   It was very painless and smooth and easy.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.400]   It's almost disconcerting the how few questions it asks you
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.800]   while you're installing.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.120]   It's like, do you agree to the license terms?
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.400]   OK.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.200]   There's no options.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.880]   There's no customization.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.360]   You can't take out languages.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.840]   You can't do a clean install.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.440]   Or it's just boom.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.920]   Now, John Sierra-Cusa in his excellent article on iOS
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.200]   Technica talks about what happens.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.000]   Apparently, a new partition is actually
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.080]   created on your drive that won't go away.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.280]   It's around a 600 megabyte partition, CD-sized partition,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.480]   that will hold a rescue version of this file.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.600]   Is that right, Andy?
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.960]   That's one of the coolest features is a fact
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.440]   that there's a standard OS-level partition that
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.920]   has recovery tools in it.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.960]   So if you have a problem with your hard drive,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.560]   and it's not mechanical, if it has
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.600]   to do with your regular boot system,
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.600]   just hold on the option key to get the standard volume
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.960]   picker or command-R to boot into the rescue picker--
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.440]   excuse me, the rescue volume--
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.880]   and you will have essentially a rescue boot DVD
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   that you'll boot into.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.480]   And the cool thing is, it also includes Safari.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.000]   So where's comes to where?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.640]   So you can hit the internet to look for diagnostic problems.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.160]   Or--
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.280]   It's a Chromebook.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.200]   Only look.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.040]   You can actually do stuff with it, and it's cool.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.880]   Mind you, there is a really neat thing as well,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.160]   which we didn't know about until today, which is the ability
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.520]   now.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.760]   Because a lot of people are saying, well, the recovery disk
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.840]   is a great idea, but it's on the same hard drive
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.000]   as your main hard drive.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.560]   So if your drive just completely crashes out or burns,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.480]   you're stuck.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.120]   But you can actually, on the new Macs
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.280]   they're bringing out from today, you can actually bootstrap
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.520]   using the EFI to app servers and actually restore
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.160]   your machine from an Apple server.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.080]   Oh, that's really cool.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.720]   Start the process often.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.680]   Obviously, you have to either have a wired internet
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.480]   connection or a Wi-Fi access point locally.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.120]   But once you boot to this new service,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.120]   you can then recover your machine without--
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.120]   even if your physical disk has been wiped down,
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.360]   you haven't got your recovery partition,
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.520]   and you haven't got a flash driver.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.120]   So that's pretty neat.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.200]   So as of now, the only way to get this is to go--
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.360]   you have to be running Snow Leopard.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.120]   You have to go to the app store.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.680]   You have to pay $30, and it is a upgrade in place.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.400]   And that's that.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.160]   Boom.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.800]   But they say they will sell a $60 USB key,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.120]   kind of like the key that comes with the air, I presume.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.600]   You can bring it to the Apple store
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.560]   if you want some help or you want to do something different.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.680]   And you can do this undocumented
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.320]   and I presume unsupported technique of burning a CD, a DVD.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.160]   I guess it'd have to be a DVD or a USB key.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.640]   You need about four gigs for this.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.920]   So I'm booting that of the USB key,
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.040]   and we'll actually walk through the install process.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.160]   I want to do a clean install.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.000]   I think this is the only way I could do this, right?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.480]   Yes.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.880]   It's interesting that they're so sure of themselves
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.600]   that they don't give that as even an option.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.040]   I'd say--
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.240]   We don't have to say that.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.680]   The couple of installs I've done where it's not
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.520]   going to clean install.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.680]   I have really few problems.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.320]   Very, very few problems.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.440]   I haven't seen anything at all.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.080]   I mean, except for scrolling completely confusing me,
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   everything else is--
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.880]   Yeah, fine.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.800]   You can see that's something interesting,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.560]   where you know that Apple has been in the middle
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.360]   of an internal struggle about that scrolling direction,
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.120]   where that now it scrolls away and iPad scrolls,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.120]   not the way that you're used to scrolling with a trackpad
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.360]   and that really screws you up.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.680]   You can tell the amount of fighting
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.520]   that must have been happening inside of Cupertino
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.800]   by the fact that the only-- the first thing that the lion does
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.560]   when it went first boots up in the first time
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.160]   is present you with this window that says, oh, by the way,
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.400]   we changed the way that we did scrolling now.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.240]   Don't freak out.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.560]   Just give it a chance.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.600]   Here's an animation of the fingers doing the scrolling.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.240]   Just do that.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.280]   You'll be fine.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.160]   But there is a way to turn that off.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.960]   That's good.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.360]   But I like to think that some manager somewhere could not
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.160]   avoid just giving people a little bit of a kick in the teeth
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.840]   because they refer to the lion default way
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.280]   of scrolling as natural mode.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.240]   So if you don't want to do that, you
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.160]   want to scroll in an unnatural fashion.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.520]   See, I got to say, I haven't had a chance yet.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.960]   I haven't downloaded the lion.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.360]   After this, I'm going to download the lion
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.880]   so I can talk about it on my live show that I did night.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.080]   I'm really excited about that because it feels like that's
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.240]   sort of the future.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.280]   It feels like the future.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.640]   It feels like the capital F future, which I know sounds stupid
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.600]   because we're talking about something as tiny as scrolling.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.720]   And I fully expect to be completely frustrated when I use it.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.920]   But it really is--
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.880]   I mean, it's the whole manipulation of the data thing
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.480]   that Jobs talked about when he first introduced the iPad,
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.560]   right?
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.280]   Well, in a larger sense, and there's
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.360]   many, many more other bits of this,
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.960]   including under the hood bits of this,
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.080]   it's the iOSification of the desktop operating system.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.680]   It is very clear now.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.520]   I don't think it's fair to say that iOS is driving the desktop,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.760]   but it's sure there's a lot of cross-pollination.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.320]   And after using it for just a few hours today,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.600]   at first my first reaction was you just spent 27 years
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.360]   teaching us how to scroll this way.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.000]   And now you're telling me, I have to scroll this way.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.240]   For people who haven't tried it yet,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.320]   it's exactly the opposite direction
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.440]   that you're used to scrolling.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.320]   Because on a tablet, it's direct drive.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.960]   It makes sense.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.840]   You move like this to go up and you move like that to go down.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.640]   But on a mouse wheel, it makes no sense at all.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.800]   It's exact opposite.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.520]   On a touchpad, it makes sense.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.040]   At a trackpad, it makes sense.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.960]   If you're using a magic mouse, it makes sense,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.760]   because you're going, hee.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.160]   So it's only really on these old scroll wheel,
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.480]   which Apple, in their defense, never even sold.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.120]   But many of us use that it's a little confusing.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.320]   But I got used to it.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.480]   But there's so much more.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.760]   This is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.920]   Yes, I'm sorry.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.760]   Go ahead, Ken.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.680]   Well, no, it's stupid how excited I get by it.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.680]   It's really good.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.240]   Because I don't think of it as the iOS
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.880]   notification of the desktop.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.080]   I think of it as this is how we're
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.960]   going to play with our data when we're
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.080]   able to-- like they do in Minority Report,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.200]   except without the little flash drives, thank you.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.640]   I like that contextualization.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.440]   It's direct driving the data.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:10.880]   Exactly.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.720]   When we're able to toss it to the wall,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.640]   and when we're able to toss it to the table,
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.360]   like you can with a piece of paper.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.760]   You move a piece of paper across the table with your hands
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.800]   the same way you're going to be moving with this.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.120]   And don't misunderstand me.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.560]   I'm sure I'm going to hate it.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.480]   I'm sure I'm going to be really frustrated when I first get it.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.960]   But it's exciting to see--
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.840]   I hate it less than I would.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.560]   --possibilities of it.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.040]   I hate it less than I thought I would.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.720]   I mean, I have to say I have a few problems with the scrolling
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.120]   because I do like it, which is a strange thing to say.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.600]   But the problem I have is that on my desk machine,
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.800]   I've been using a Wacom pen tablet for the longest time.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.440]   I actually use this instead of a mouse.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.480]   And that's what Ken was saying.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.880]   That's direct drive, right?
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.760]   Yeah, and that's great.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.080]   So I can actually sort of grab something and pull it down.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.600]   So if I'm sort of scrolling in the column, I can pull it down.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.680]   But now with the reverse scrolling in Lion, it's reversed.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.920]   So my pen works the wrong way round.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.200]   So I can either have the trackpad working
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.240]   and not the pen working or the pen working fine,
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.480]   and the trackpad is the wrong way round.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.120]   So I'm hoping that Wacom will actually bring out a driver
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.080]   that you can enable your pen to be in a--
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.760]   I'm not sure if they could actually do that, though.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.600]   But it's causing me a few problems at the minute
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.320]   because it really is useful having a trackpad
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.840]   because there's so many gestures in Lion--
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.600]   Agreed.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.880]   --in between the full screen, et cetera.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.320]   But it is causing me some complications
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.360]   with using a pen tablet with it at the same time.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.960]   And I should say, I was using an air.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.200]   And because the air has a large trackpad
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.320]   and does all-- is always done those gestures,
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.200]   it's very natural on the air, not the new air, the older.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.280]   And of course, as the chatroom is yelling at me saying,
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.240]   you can turn this off.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.680]   But I think Ken's saying you shouldn't.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.640]   You should get used to it.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.880]   Kind of severe.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.440]   Persevere.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.520]   It's probably a good idea because if you're
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.520]   going to be switching between multiple machines,
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.200]   it's best to learn how the default mode works
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.440]   or else you're going to be driving yourself crazy every time
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.400]   going and switching that back the way it is.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.360]   I'm not liking it more.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.920]   I'm hating it less, but I'm getting used to it.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.320]   The bigger disappointment for me, though,
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.600]   is that one of the big bullet point items
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.480]   and bringing features back to the Mac from the iPad
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.040]   is making sure that there's just
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.800]   like chock full of nougaty, multi-touch goodness
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.400]   and just about everything that you do.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.960]   And it is kind of cool to be able to switch apps just
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.880]   by putting the right number of fingers down and swooshing.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.240]   It is cool to put a different number of fingers down
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.640]   in the browser.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.000]   And you're doing that to go back and forth between pages.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.560]   And I like my iPad.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.280]   I like the way that works.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.040]   But the problem is, though, all those things require me
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.520]   to take my hand-- if I'm on my notebook,
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.000]   it requires me to take my hands off the keyboard
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.960]   and move it to something else to make that happen.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.240]   And there are really cool keyboard shortcuts
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.600]   for all of these things.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.440]   So I'm wondering how much saturation
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.640]   they're going to get with it.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.360]   That's interesting.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.000]   New users are-- they're not going to instinctively think,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.400]   oh, if I put four fingers down this way and swoosh it that way,
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.840]   I'll get the application launcher.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.440]   They want to look for that dingus in the doc that says,
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.880]   oh, here is the tool for the launch pad.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.160]   And here's how I activate that.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.840]   Power users are going to be thinking, well, actually,
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.780]   by would I even bother to use that gesture
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.920]   requisite command tab and see a list of all my running apps
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.160]   and then switch from it that way.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.800]   So I've been using it for two or three weeks.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.080]   And I really-- few of these gestures have really caught on
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.600]   with me.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.960]   I'm different than anybody else.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.200]   But it is a factor.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.360]   I don't think that was thought out as well as it might have been.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.600]   Well, there's a number of things.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.160]   And even John Sercuzu in his extensive review,
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.800]   which is mostly positive, does talk about those.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.440]   We're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.240]   One of the things he doesn't like is linen.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.040]   There's a lot of it.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.800]   This is the new linen texture, which you'll see kind of everywhere.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.320]   I have made a boot key.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.960]   I created a boot key getting the install ESD DMG file out
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.520]   of the contents, the package contents.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.360]   When you boot to it--
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.240]   this is the interface you get.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.640]   You get four choices.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.160]   You can restore from a time machine backup, reinstall OS X.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.400]   That's a clean install, by the way.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.440]   Get help online or disk utility.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.000]   So I guess for the rest of this show,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.440]   I'm going to be on this machine installing lion.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.800]   You could start the clock now.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.320]   It's 11.32.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.280]   And there's the picture you're going to get.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.080]   You ready, kids?
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.240]   Here we go.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.560]   And we'll continue our conversation at 11.32.56 mark.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.800]   Now, crap.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.760]   Agree.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   Oh, crap.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.000]   Agree.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.760]   I'm going to install it on this machine.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.520]   Yes.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.600]   OK.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.000]   Now start the clock.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.480]   11.33.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.240]   And I'm installing it on that machine.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.160]   A lot of UI changes, a lot of little things
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.840]   like the scroll bar changes, too.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.800]   You can now drag and resize windows from all directions.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   Even the little-- all the widgets have changed slightly
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.440]   in an interesting way.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.840]   But it's the under the hood changes.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.760]   Cucia-Cusa points out that I think are really significant.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.320]   For instance, applications don't really quit anymore.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.000]   It's much like iOS in the sense that, I guess, in a way,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.160]   this part's not about users.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.760]   It's a new way of thinking of what an operating system is.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.400]   And I kind of like the new document model
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.880]   and the new application model.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.440]   Andy, can you describe what I'm saying when I say
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.120]   they don't quit anymore?
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.720]   There are a couple of different things
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.520]   that sort of work together in a very subtle way.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.920]   One of the things that Lion takes away from iOS
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.960]   is the idea that you don't necessarily quit NAP.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.080]   You just sort of freeze it in place
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.200]   and then reallocate its system resources
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.560]   so you don't need them right now.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.360]   So the idea is that if I'm in text edit, which is right now
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.360]   the best text editor that is optimized for Lion,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.920]   if I've got nine windows open and I've selected some text
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.040]   and one window, some text another window,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.120]   if I need to quit out of text edit,
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.400]   I don't have to save every one of these windows
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.880]   and reopen them later on.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.040]   I just quit text edit.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.360]   Then when I open it again,
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.840]   this is restored exactly to the state that it was before.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.760]   Not only are the same documents open,
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.240]   but they're also scrolled to the exact same space.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.960]   They're scrolled to the exact same space.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.440]   Any text that was highlighted is still highlighted.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.000]   And because it does this version control,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.360]   it's automatically saved all of these documents.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.360]   So it didn't have to go to that really horrible wall.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.520]   So we've been going through for the past five years,
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.280]   10 years with macOS 10, where you want to just quit,
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.560]   but it has to show you every one of these open files
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.440]   just because you changed a comma somewhere.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.560]   There's unsafe changes.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.680]   Do you want to review those before?
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.680]   No, please, I just want to shut down and leave.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.520]   (laughing)
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.640]   No, this is actually,
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.320]   it's starting to make sense to me.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.440]   It is also iOSification,
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.000]   but I think this is also a modern operating system.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.160]   Yeah, I mean, there are a couple of,
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.120]   we'll get to versions a little bit later,
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.040]   but versions is great, but we all have to say,
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.880]   well, hold off a minute.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.240]   One of the things that really occurred to me is that,
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.280]   I think that Apple is taking the first really visible step
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.200]   in making files and folders and directories
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.520]   into an abstract concept
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.920]   and trying to hide those whenever possible.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.200]   You can see these in so many different places.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.720]   There's now a new find review
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.800]   that just simply says,
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.600]   it's simply a button that says, "All my files."
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.120]   And you're like, well, surely it doesn't mean,
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.560]   show all my files in my window, but yes, it does.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.520]   You click this button,
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.480]   it will put every file you've got on your file.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.320]   (laughing)
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.320]   You can find it on the top.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.520]   But the cool thing is,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.920]   it makes it totally abstract.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.760]   It doesn't show you,
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.000]   if you drill down into your pictures folder
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.480]   inside your photos folder,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.240]   inside your vacation folder,
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.600]   now we'll just give you files,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.460]   just break all the files that Spotlight has indexed,
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.040]   by group and by type.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.560]   And so it makes it very, very easy to get.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.520]   It doesn't really make a difference that,
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.520]   there's a picture that you're in a rush.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.240]   You didn't realize you saved it to the desktop
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.520]   and so the pictures folder.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.080]   You might not find it if you forgot what the name was,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.200]   by looking at the pictures folder.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.040]   But if you just look in all my files, there it is.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.400]   And it's actually very, very fast way it does it.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.680]   Also the way that it's organizing the applications
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   in the launch pad,
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.040]   again, is trying to get you to forget
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.000]   where, what directory these applications are actually in
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.760]   and just think of them as the resource that you're using.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.440]   I could make it sound like it's more ambitious
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.280]   than it actually is,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.120]   but I think it's significant that Apple's doing so many things
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.160]   to sort of make you remember that it's no longer really
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.800]   necessary for you to know exactly where a file is,
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.000]   so long as the operating system can give it to you
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.840]   when you need it.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.160]   >> Now, of course this is a precursor to iCloud as well.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.000]   I mean, we saw this with the WWGC with iPad,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.480]   you know, and then suddenly the penny dropped.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.520]   This is why the file management on the iPad was so poor
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.800]   and why we had so many problems getting files in and out
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.320]   in the iCloud wasn't ready.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.080]   Now, we now see what the grand design is for iCloud
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.920]   with iPad.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.880]   I think we still yet to see it for Lion,
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.520]   but as Andy says, these sorts of technologies
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.040]   and these ways of handling files are very much indication,
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.000]   I think, on the direction of Apple are taken with iCloud.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.240]   >> So by the way, this is happening very quickly,
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.680]   but I think that the reinstall is almost over.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.840]   So I think for a clean install,
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.760]   it doesn't take very long, maybe eight or nine minutes.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.840]   >> I had somebody on Twitter tell me that an upgrade
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.120]   or not a clean install took them about 20 minutes,
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.640]   which was stunning.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.000]   >> Yeah, everything happens much faster than you'd think,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.120]   except for the download, that takes forever,
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.240]   which is why I birded on a key.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.200]   It does look like though, if you do that,
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.840]   that you don't have the option to upgrade,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.200]   that you're going to do a clean install.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.320]   It looks as far as I can tell,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.880]   I didn't see a upgrade in place,
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.320]   it's clean install when you boot from a key like this,
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.040]   which is fine on this machine, we'll see.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.680]   So you have kind of a time machine-like versioning system
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.800]   as well, which I think is, now, again,
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.320]   this requires an app be written to use this feature.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.360]   Of course, all of Apple's apps will.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.560]   Same thing with full screen, although I noticed Chrome
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.040]   is already ready to go with the full screen button,
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.480]   which is great.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.240]   I didn't think I would like the full screen,
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.800]   this is another iOS feature.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.040]   And I really kind of do when I'm reading a browser page,
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.280]   when I was reading John's article,
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.080]   Syracuse's article, for instance,
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.640]   full screen on Chrome, and it was just very natural,
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.080]   even the fingers with the scrolling,
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.320]   again, on an air, on a small factor system,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.000]   it made a lot of sense.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.400]   >> And it's not just the idea that it expands to full screen,
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.080]   even though that's in itself is a great feature.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.920]   I mean, it's a great for distraction, free working,
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.120]   and maximizing small displays and big displays.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.200]   >> The talk goes away, the menu goes away.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.280]   >> Right, everything goes away.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   But also that a well-written app will also go
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.080]   into a whole different manner of thinking.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.160]   I love the fact that when you're in the mail app,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.960]   another app that I really, really like,
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.800]   I think it's a huge one.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.720]   >> Yes, we'll get to that in a second,
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.480]   'cause it shocked me, it changed so much.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.680]   >> So if you're in regular mode, you hit reply to a message,
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.720]   you get the usual thing where it opens up a new window,
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.600]   and okay, now you're dealing with that.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.080]   In full screen mode, though, it does this really cool
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.720]   little camera move where it sort of dims the lights
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.480]   on your inbox and puts a spotlight on this brand new
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.600]   document that you've put that's front and center
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.720]   inside the screen.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.120]   And so you're just focusing on taking on writing this email.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.360]   And then when you click, sand it, window shades up,
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   the background now fades back up again,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.200]   and now you're back into the task you were looking at.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.240]   >> It initially might be looking at all these different takes.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.440]   >> Initially might be looking at phusing,
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.320]   because when you go full screen, there's nothing,
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.280]   and it doesn't seem like you can escape or anything,
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.720]   but you have to move your mouse up to the top,
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.840]   and then the menu comes back.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.480]   The first few times it's going to confuse people
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.320]   a little bit, I think, but I think in the long run, great.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.640]   Now they're telling me that this is not an upgrade,
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.600]   that this is an upgrade in place.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.520]   We shall see, because I didn't format,
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.840]   but the language it told me sounded like
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.800]   it was going to rewrite the whole drive, so we'll see.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.120]   Didn't give me a big warning about you,
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.400]   sure you want to erase all your data,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.440]   so maybe you will keep me in place.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.840]   I know we're jumping around a lot,
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.000]   but we only have an hour and a half,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.240]   and you could probably take 10 days
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.600]   to talk about all the new features of Lion.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.080]   Let's talk about the versioning a little bit.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.720]   It's using a time machine interface.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.000]   So instead of now on, again, apps that are designed for Lion,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   instead of saying save as or save, it says save a version,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.960]   and right below that is a duplicate command.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.000]   Explain that to me, Andy, what's going on?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.440]   >> Now, instead of just saving one final state of the document
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.560]   and replacing it every time you do a save,
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.480]   it's actually saving the process
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.040]   of putting the document in that state.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.720]   There are a bunch of circumstances under which a Lion app
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.320]   will automatically save a new snapshot of the document
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.160]   you're working on.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.320]   Every time you open a document,
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.040]   it creates a new snapshot of what it was like
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.800]   when you reopened it.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.760]   Once every hour, it will take a new snapshot.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   Also, whenever Lion detects that you've made a significant
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.800]   change to it, it will take another snapshot.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.720]   So that means that if you are in the middle of like hour three
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.160]   of writing this thing and you realize,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.440]   ah, dang it, this whole, I shouldn't have deleted
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.720]   that whole section, actually, I actually need to go back to that.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.320]   It's possible to open up a time machine.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.840]   So there's the revert feature that you're familiar with
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.840]   in the file menu is now actually sort of a document-based
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.160]   time machine where on the left-hand side of the screen,
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.080]   you'll see the document as it is the version
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.560]   of the document you have right now.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.680]   On the right-hand side of the screen,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.560]   you will see a time machine like progression
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.560]   of all the different versions that got saved.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.720]   So you can rewind and replace the current version
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.080]   with a version that was saved about an hour ago,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.840]   or you can just review what this document was like
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.480]   two hours ago, just take that paragraph that you deleted
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.160]   and just put it back in this new document
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.960]   and then say, okay, that's what I wanted to do.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.960]   Please take me back to the future and just,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.320]   with that one change that I made
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.960]   to the current version of the document.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.120]   So in my case, for instance, not only is it good for booboos,
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.280]   and not only does it protect you
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.200]   from not having saved your changes,
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.880]   but also you could use it for almost every column
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.240]   that I write for the Sun times.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.320]   I write a long version of it that goes onto the web,
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.960]   but then I have to do like a 500 to 800 word version
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.120]   that's for the print edition.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.600]   And usually I have to do that by writing one edition
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.080]   and then saving that and then creating a duplicate of that,
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.480]   creating a brand new document,
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.760]   and then rewriting it and cutting paste it all over again
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.920]   to make the shorter version.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.000]   With this version control,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.400]   I can just simply make sure that after I finish the web version,
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.440]   I just save a snap to make sure I explicitly save
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.280]   a snapshot of it.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.080]   If I don't want to trust the system,
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.160]   I can do that explicitly.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.800]   And then I can just simply cut this 4,000 word thing down
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.840]   to 750 words, knowing that the file that I've got
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.640]   on my desktop there contains every edition of this document
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.720]   that ever existed.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.200]   So if I want to get back to that 3,000 word version,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.320]   all to do is just re-want to the 3,000 word version,
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.160]   I've got it.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.640]   I can duplicate of it or do whatever I want.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.000]   You never lose any version because even if you revert
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.120]   to an older version, the more recent version gets saved
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.760]   as another version, that's part of the whole history.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.240]   And I think that this is going to be a lifesaver
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.320]   for normal people.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.600]   And I think Geeks will be used to it.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.800]   I think this is how it should be.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   It's such a far ranging feature too,
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.800]   because when you think about what Apple wants to do
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.160]   with iCloud, where they want to make,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.520]   in the word processor that hopefully you'll be using
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.880]   in September or October, it will not only be
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.160]   studly for line, but it will also be studly for iCloud,
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.000]   where as I'm writing this review--
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.960]   Go ahead.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.680]   As I'm writing this review, I can say,
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.560]   I want to share this with every single copy
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.320]   of this word processor that I use.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.000]   Now, instead of having to update this 200K file
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.840]   to a million different machines,
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.640]   all it has to do is every time a new version is created,
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.440]   send maybe 8K worth of text.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.440]   Oh, by the way, he changed this line to this line
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.000]   or he added this paragraph right here.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.360]   Right.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   That was much faster.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.840]   Is there a go through that until we get iCloud in?
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.840]   That I think it does actually need Time Machine.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.360]   I mean, if I'm not using Time Machine, which I'm not--
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.960]   I don't think versions were.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.960]   Correct me if I'm wrong, Andy, but am I limited testing?
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.200]   Because I haven't been that many applications
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   that we've contested with me.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:32.760]   Let me check.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.440]   I might have to turn on Time Machine.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.000]   That's a good reason to turn on Time Machine.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.360]   We check.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.560]   I don't believe I have Time Machine turned on here.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.480]   It's interesting that neither you nor I nor Don use.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.480]   Can you use Time Machine?
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.320]   Has anybody used Time Machine?
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.120]   No, you don't need it.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.720]   I've got Time Machine turned off here.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.120]   I did a fresh install, and they complained
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.040]   that it couldn't find a Time Machine volume the first time
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.240]   I tried versions, but I tried it today, and it seemed OK.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   OK, so now I know we rebooted, and now I
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.680]   know what that stick was doing.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.560]   It was creating that 600 megabyte partition,
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.240]   copying the rescue files over to it,
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.200]   because now it says installing OS 10 on the disk to its studio,
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.760]   time remaining 33 minutes.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.000]   So what it was doing-- this is actually very analogous
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.960]   to what Windows 7 now does, which is it copies files onto the drive
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.360]   and then installs from those files.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.760]   It's using an image system.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.560]   I imagine Apple's also using an image system,
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.720]   which is blast this stuff on.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.760]   It's much faster than a direct copy.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.600]   Can I ask a question that I will be able to answer for myself later,
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.520]   but I want to know right now?
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.600]   I like it, Ken.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.600]   You have not installed it.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.760]   So you can be the person listening at home who says, what the hell?
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.040]   Well, I am that person right now.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.480]   Yes, what the hell?
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.320]   As far as versions goes, is there ever a point
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.760]   where you can get rid of the other versions?
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.800]   Because you were saying, you know, you can hold on them forever.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.880]   Can I, at some point, just put the stamp down and say, OK,
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.280]   Ken, the rest of this, I just want this one that I finish now.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.440]   Yeah, there are two different things you can do for privacy.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.120]   One, when you go into that time machine view,
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.600]   you can delete previous versions so that they no longer exist.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.200]   What most people are more concerned about is, if I send this to my editor,
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.720]   is my editor going to see just what things here I made out of this
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.880]   while I was screwing around for the first five hours?
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.120]   But every time-- and I haven't had a chance to really experiment with this--
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.640]   but every time that you export this file,
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.320]   either save it into a different format,
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:18.400]   or use some mail or something else to share this file with somebody else,
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.080]   it essentially does a save as and burns it down
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.160]   if you're just the current version, the latest version.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.880]   So no one will be able to see the previous history of it
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.400]   unless you explicitly--
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.200]   I think I'm running it from out there.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.640]   I was trying to--
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.360]   No, the answer is no.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.440]   One of the last things on my punch list was,
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.800]   under what circumstance can you give somebody this file with all the versions?
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.920]   Oh, Ken, I wonder, can you bundle the versions up?
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:48.360]   I'm sure that if you zip it, that would sort of prevent any fudu from happening to it later on.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.680]   What Apple says explicitly and what I've been able to figure out
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.720]   just by emailing files back and forth is that as soon as you leave
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:59.400]   sort of the domain of your machine, all the different versions of it go away,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.280]   and it becomes just a standard word file, which when you think about it,
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.480]   is what happens otherwise--
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.320]   That makes sense.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.600]   People in their own netbooks with Windows wouldn't be able to open it.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.280]   Now, some things are going to confuse people.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.880]   First of all, not all apps will support this,
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.040]   and so you're going to be in a weird for a while hybrid world
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.240]   where some apps are--
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.080]   You have to continue to do this save, save, save, or save as.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.680]   Some apps just do it for you automatically.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.280]   That's going to be confusing because you got to pay attention to what app is doing, what.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:27.720]   I think that people also need to understand some of the other advantages of this.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.000]   You touched on it a little bit, Andy.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.640]   Apps can share files with other apps even while you're working in them.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.920]   So if another app wants to look at this file, for instance,
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.280]   let's say you're working on a word processing document, but you want to email it, you can.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.400]   The email application will say to the word processor, save the most recent state,
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.360]   "I'm going to use that."
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:54.760]   It's actually exactly how a user doesn't want to know about a file being busy or locked or
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.800]   anything like that.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.080]   None of that happens anymore.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.200]   And then after two weeks of inactivity, an application gets kind of locked down
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.640]   so that changes don't get made, versions don't get kept.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.040]   What's happening all across the board behind the scenes is a lot of
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.760]   automatic operating system activities, which initially might disconcert people because
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.520]   this stuff happens without anybody explicitly telling you.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.240]   But I think makes sense to the novice.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.880]   I think those of us who are paying attention will figure it out and it'll make sense to us.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.560]   But there's going to be this period of time where it's not something's happening here,
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.600]   and I'm not sure what it is.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.800]   Or if it's happening with all my apps, which it won't be.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.200]   Yeah, but the first time someone actually thinks,
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.520]   "Oh, where's that version of that document gone?"
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.240]   And then goes into it the first time and actually sees all these different versions.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.120]   They'll probably go, "Wow."
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:42.440]   Wow.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.360]   And it's in a time machine interface, which I think is very intriguing.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:52.920]   Or the first time that someone, your kid needs a place to plug in the charger for his phone
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.560]   and unplug your iMac wire in the middle of working something,
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.720]   and you plug it back in and it just restarts exactly to where everything was before,
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.240]   and everything has automatically been saved.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.920]   You're like, "I'm going to kill that kid."
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.400]   But first, I'm going to write a lovely letter to my local app.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.760]   Thank you, Steve Jobs.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:12.760]   Here's the versioning interface from John Syracuse's article, his 27,000 word article,
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.040]   which by the way, ours Technica is not only offering for free on their website,
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.280]   but you can buy an e-book or a PDF of it, which I think is a really nice idea,
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.000]   because it is a book.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.960]   So here's the versioning, as you can see, in final draft, which apparently supports it,
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.600]   and you can go to the current document, go back in time,
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.480]   and we've now verified that's without the time machine running,
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.000]   but it is a time machine interface to all of that.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.800]   I think that's great.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.840]   You can also, that's what the duplicate command does, is now saves another,
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.720]   like this is the version, I want to preserve this version,
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.160]   and you can keep, I mean, some very interesting new ways of working.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.600]   You do have a lot of control over this, and I think you're right that there are going to be
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.200]   some people who are going to have to adapt to it,
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.680]   but among those features is the ability to lock this version,
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.160]   to say that, "Look, I don't want to be messing around with this anymore."
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:57.720]   So here it is.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.360]   Right.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:03.560]   And then it says, "Lock documents two weeks after last edit,"
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.880]   which means that you basically, this document,
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.320]   then can't be accidentally changed.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:15.640]   I think there's going to be huge pressure on developers to lionize their programs quickly.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.160]   Do we know how many developers are doing that?
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.480]   It seems like I've seen a number of lion versions come across the App Store.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.400]   You're going to want to use the App Store too, by the way.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.600]   Yeah, I've seen quite a few now.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.960]   I think that will be a requirement of all apps in the App Store, I would guess.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.280]   I would think when people start to see apps that don't have the full screen mode,
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.440]   they'll think, "Well, that's an old Apple bundle, right?"
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.760]   I think developers will actually strive to get them lionized so that they can,
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.800]   they look modern and they look part of the operating system.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.240]   Just like a car designer can keep putting TILF in on a car,
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.800]   but that will really broadcast the world at while you really are.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:57.320]   And again, just to reiterate, and Syracuse points us out,
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.160]   that when you look at the dock, there's no more of those little lights on the dock
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.640]   saying which applications are running because it's meaningless to say that an
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.560]   application is running nowadays.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.200]   Actually, there were.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.600]   You could turn it on if you want.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.120]   But I think it used to be switched off, but used to be on by default,
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.400]   but I think it's the other way.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.760]   I think it's switched off by default.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.440]   But they are on or off by default.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.480]   I think they're on by default now.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.440]   Oh, interesting.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:20.760]   Okay.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.600]   That's a change since the developer version.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:27.320]   That probably, they thought, and this might scare people too much.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:27.960]   Sure.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.720]   But the notion of an app, so an application can be asked to kind of
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.560]   terminate by the operating system if the resources are needed,
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.400]   but can be relaunched instantly.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.760]   The application, of course, gets to say, you know, I'm, wait a minute, hold on.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.520]   Let me say that, okay, now you can do it.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.200]   There's sudden termination, automatic termination.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.280]   Let's, I want to take a break.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.160]   When we come back, I want to talk about some stuff that users are going to see,
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.480]   particularly the new mission control.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.760]   It's considerable new user interface modifications.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.680]   We're talking about Lion.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.520]   We still will talk about, we have not,
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.840]   but we will talk about Apple's earnings call.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.840]   Good news, of course, there and new hardware.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.920]   Some really interesting new hardware and the loss of a dearly loved Mac.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.600]   Gone forever.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.920]   Before we do that though, our guests, by the way,
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.600]   for the first time ever, really glad to have OSKEN.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.640]   Tell us your, the name, how do I find the Mac OSKEN podcast?
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:33.720]   Well, online, it's MacOSKEN.com, or just search iTunes for Mac OSKEN.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.680]   That's the easiest way.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.960]   And then searching iTunes for Mac OSKEN will get you both that
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:42.600]   and Mac OSKEN live, which is a call-in show that we do with every Wednesday night.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.880]   Yeah, I love it that you do that.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.320]   And you'll be doing that tonight.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.520]   Yeah, we will be doing that tonight.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.880]   Yeah, I think that's me.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.760]   Yeah, thanks.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.960]   So nice to have you on the show.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.240]   I don't know what's kept me.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.120]   I think I thought you were just competition.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.240]   But now I know it's you're a frenemy.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.880]   Why not?
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.800]   Yeah, well, thanks for having me.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.640]   No, I'm the meaning to for the longest time, and so I'm so glad we could.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.440]   And of course, Don, our great friend, Don McAllister, from Screencast's online,
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.920]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times, who's writing his own.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.200]   Are you going to make it 27,001 words?
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   No, I have an editor in Chicago who could be here in about three
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.080]   hours and kill me.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.480]   Also, I'm not as hard a worker as John Syracuse is.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:33.080]   It looks like he's going to be clocking in at about four thousand words.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.000]   I've got another three paragraphs to write and I've done.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.480]   I can only think that John just hasn't gotten any sleep in the last three or four days.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:44.920]   No, no, I went up near with him a few weeks ago, and this was just a plea.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.000]   He's an apple of shipline, so I don't have to write anymore about this.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.400]   But as he did with Snow Leopard and Leopard before it, he has written the definitive
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.040]   kind of summary of everything, especially.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.800]   I mean, it gets technical within the first six pages, everything under the hood that you
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.440]   might want to know as a serious power user.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:10.760]   But I think that we can summarize the bottom line is that it is truly the IOSification of the
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.240]   desktop.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.280]   And that can be good and that can be bad.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.480]   He taught me a new word.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.360]   Let me see if I can find it in the review.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   What is it? It's what?
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.160]   Okay, I got to look it up.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:29.480]   I think I'd rather say that it's the most future forward release of the OS since 10.4.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.760]   Okay, future forward.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.360]   And part of that involves taking some components from IOS, but it's mostly,
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.040]   this is what we're, these are the introduction, the new technologies that Apple is going to be
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.520]   relying on for the next two, three, four, five years, I think.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.640]   He introduces to me, anyway, the word skewomorphic,
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.960]   which I love, which is when you take something on a desktop, a computer screen,
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:55.720]   and you make it look like the real world analog, and he uses as an example, this appalling
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:04.440]   stitchery on the, on the calendar, the leather stitching, just it's nicely done.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.560]   But why? So we'll talk about and oh yeah, by the way, look at that.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.080]   There's a little edge of paper left over from the last page you ripped off.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.480]   Why? Oh, why Apple? We'll talk about that too in just a bit. But before we do,
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:21.160]   I want to thank our good friends, at Citrix, guys who make go to meeting and of course, make it Mac
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.320]   capable, go to meeting is the greatest way to meet you've ever tried.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.360]   You could start your meeting in seconds, even if your attendees have never used go to meeting
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:36.760]   before. It's as simple as sending them a link or an invitation. In fact, I do through a calendar
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.640]   invitation. So they get a pop up in their email, it adds it to iCal, they click the link and they're
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.880]   in the meeting. Phone number that they can call is there if they want to use teleconferencing,
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:51.240]   but of course they can also use VoIP, use their Mac built in microphone and a headset to make the
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   call. They see your screen, you can see their screen, everybody's in the meeting instantly.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.640]   There are no technical hurdles, no headaches, you don't waste time getting started, you just
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.680]   get to the point we use it even just for teleconferences, because it's so much easier to start a
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:14.840]   meeting that way. I just love it. And by the way, iPad capable, so you can attend a meeting on the
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:20.200]   iPad and that is pretty dramatic. I want you to try to go to meeting right now, click the try it free

[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:08.440]   So what is that word again? I wish I could remember it's Greek. I'd never heard it before.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:14.280]   It's skew skewomorphic. Is that how you say it? You had you heard, I don't you're nodding like
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:19.880]   you know this word. You've heard this. You've used it in a sentence. Yeah, no, I was thinking
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:25.160]   digital conference and actually came up in some of the talks there about this, you know, making
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:30.760]   inanimate objects or objects that don't really need this layer of authenticity to sort of overlay
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:35.960]   this this this real life rendering on them. And I guess I mean I would guess that the reason to do
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.680]   this is make people feel comfortable with it. Oh, it looks like my real calendar. But Sir
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:47.560]   Q says makes the point he says that always 10 lion is writing checks. It can't cash. For instance,
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.560]   he says, you know, this this tear off implies that you could tear off this page. You can't.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:57.800]   That you know that there are things that the UI is implying that don't that don't help. And I'm
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:04.040]   not sure I really want stitching on a digital calendar. It's it's possible to be kind of a
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:09.160]   Sheldon about this. So you we understand you can't tear a page off of the screen. We're doing
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.000]   something pretty to make it look interesting. But you could well but you could you can tear
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.160]   perry. There are plenty of that's where you can tear pages off. But actually actually that gives
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.960]   me an idea of something to think about. What if we what if you change the system clock to December?
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.360]   Would there I bet you any amount of money that there'd be thicker stack of torn off pages because
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.600]   somebody's Apple thought that this is the end of the year we've torn off 12 pages of calendar.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.160]   They're doing the same with a dress book haven't they? They've turned it into a proper book.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   Yeah. And they put book a bookmark there. What do you think happens when you click that bookmark?
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.000]   Can you move it? Can you tear it? No, it's it shows groups. I guess that's what that double
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.480]   head icon should be doing. Yeah. You can apparently turn pages but he complains that the page pages
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.840]   showing on the left and right don't change. It's you know, it's nice to know that this is a
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:00.120]   hands-on signature. But do I really need that in this day and age? I mean,
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.080]   well you got too far with it. That's that's been an item of pretty severe discussion over the
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.880]   past two or three weeks. Well, why are we laying things out to look like a paper calendar? Today's
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.360]   generation has ever seen a paper calendar because with their rocket boots and their flared trousers
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.840]   they've never heard of those things. But I might mean my reaction is can you think of a better way
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:23.720]   to let people see what their entire month looks like? Did they have a grid of seven by like seven
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:27.000]   by six? Well, that's one of the art the arguments that John makes is
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.800]   if okay on a computer desktop, especially a big computer desktop, which many of us now have,
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:39.080]   you can show more than the 30 days in a month. But then you never do in the apple eye cow.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:45.240]   It just makes the makes each day bigger. He says, you know, this is a computer. We could have more
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:51.320]   than four weeks at a time or, you know, seven days. We can we can use this space more intelligently.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.880]   We don't have to be slavish to the physicality. And I think that's his complaint is that it's
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.440]   slavish. I mean, it's a minor complaint. I don't think it's a huge complaint. It's not going to drive
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:06.920]   me crazy. But I think the stitching is a little annoying. I have to admit. I think it goes back to
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.840]   making it not I hate the way I don't think they're dumbing down the operating system, but they are
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:14.280]   making it more user friendly and more friendly to people who perhaps might need youth computers.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.840]   Because I still think that the, you know, that the transition from having the iPod as being the
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.480]   halo device when people had an iPod and they moved to the Mac because they like the iPod and they got
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.640]   all the music on it. It was completely different now. The halo device now is the iPhone, you know,
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.200]   and the iPad. And that's probably going to drive a lot more people to the desktop and laptop
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   platforms, you know, once they've used those devices for a while. So this is really just, you know,
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.880]   it's the iOS certification of OS 10. It's just to make it more friendly for those people who
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:47.720]   perhaps have cut the teeth on an iOS device and want to come across to a desktop Mac that some of
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.120]   these, you know, small minor touches just making that bit more friendly and that bit more easy for,
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:57.720]   you know, quote, normal people to use. Now, one thing I do like, and I think is a good, is a good
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.920]   positive move in the right direction is mission control. Andy, you've used it for a while. Would
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:07.640]   you describe mission control to me? It's sort of a mashup between spaces and expose. One thing
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:13.720]   that's absolutely great about it is that it makes expose into a little bit more useful of a thing.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:18.200]   Expose the old expose, you have like, if you have like more than let's say a dozen windows open,
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:22.520]   it's no good because they're all like poster stamp size, know what's going on. The mission
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:27.400]   control will group them together by application. You can also select a window, a thumbnail within
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.520]   that pile and then use quick look to so you can see exactly what that window content is. And then
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.920]   you can manipulate that as it were like a document hole and then move it onto another,
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:42.360]   move it onto another desktop, move it onto another application. There's also organization for
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.800]   different spaces up at the top there. So that's another way of organizing windows around.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:50.280]   And it makes it really easy to create new spaces. There's a hidden control up on the left, on the
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.840]   right hand side of the screen that will sort of slide in a brand new space in there. I like it
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:44:00.520]   that when you take an app full screen, it makes it a space. Yeah. So it makes it easy to flip between
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.680]   all these different full screen views. I didn't use spaces because it was kind of non-intuitive
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.120]   and it would seem like a lot of work. But this I will use I think because I will use full screen
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:14.680]   apps. And the fact that I can forefinger swipe an app out or launch this mission control and see
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:19.480]   what else is there is I think a nice to me that seems sensible. I can't have to defer judgment.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.280]   I don't I don't respond. I think it's cool. But and there's another direct lift for my review.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.440]   It's like I also thought that expose was cool. I also thought that the space was cool. But
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.840]   about a week after a week after writing the review, I never used it again because it just is not
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:37.240]   the way that I think it's not the way that I use the thing. So hopefully when more full screen
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.920]   apps start to appear and more of the apps that I use are full screen. I'll find
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:46.840]   space in my heart for for mission control. Right now it's a cool thing. But I was thinking about
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:52.680]   the dashboard is now like the extreme leftmost thing when you're scrolling from pain to pain
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.160]   from running after running space running space. And it occurred to me that that's the first time
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:02.680]   I have seen dashboard on any one of my Macs and what must be seven eight nine ten months.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.960]   Yep. Yep. I never use it. Well idea that became completely useless and it's still what about this?
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.840]   And it's not the purposes. This is pure iOS. You now can see all your applications in a grid.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:18.440]   You can even if you hold down the option key, they jiggle and you can even drag them into
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:24.200]   folders. Look, we have little iOS style folders for utilities and developer there. I mean,
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:31.400]   this is pure iOS. There's even the dots for which screen you're on. Yeah. Good idea, Don. Bad idea.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.440]   Again, I don't know if it's something that I'll use a lot to be honest, especially I think lots
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.640]   of these features are best suited to the laptop rather than I mean, I sit in front of a 30 inch,
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.280]   you know, you don't need this in a big sky. Double you know, double screens as well. And one of the
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:50.120]   things that slightly irritating is that the full screen mode actually doesn't handle multiple monitors
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:55.320]   when you do a full screen mode. It just goes on your primary monitor. So the the secondary monitor
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:01.640]   is pretty much redundant. But I think on a monitor, sorry, on a laptop, I think a lot of these
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:07.640]   features are be really very, very useful. So but again, I probably won't use it on my desktop as
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.840]   much as probabilistic to some of my favorites like launch bar and command tab, etc. But I think,
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.440]   and I think I don't know if you'd agree with me, Ken, I think the laptop, Apple sees a laptop as
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:23.800]   its future is particularly the air. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, what was it? I know we're
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.960]   not getting the earnings call yet, but I think it was I can't remember somebody asked Tim Cook,
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.040]   what was the deal with not selling as many maxes everybody thought they were going to sell. And
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:39.720]   Tim Cook said this time last year, we launched the MacBook Pro and this year we're launching the
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:44.040]   iMac and we don't sell as many iMacs as we sell MacBook Pros. So I mean, just just even in the
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.960]   answers to the questions, they're saying that as the future. The question of course, then when Steve
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:54.520]   Jobs goes to WWDC and demotes the Mac, I mean, is the laptop the future is just the whole iOS thing,
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:01.400]   it's just the whole portability thing. But yeah, it's not the desktop. Yeah, I mean, so people like
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.960]   Don who are desktop users and I have, you know, I have a big Mac Pro, all our editors have big
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:11.720]   Mac Pros, we're just we're kind of a sideline. You're the truck people, you're the truck people
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.960]   that's talking about. Yeah. Well, you know, I have to say, I've been seriously considering
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:20.920]   I've got my Mac Pro which is for video editing, but really the only power of the Mac Pro I need
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.760]   for video editing is when I actually do the video encoding. I actually use a MacBook
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:29.000]   for my... It's not very interesting. You can see. And like I did a show last week all about Final
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.920]   Cut Pro 10 and I actually recorded the entire show using Final Cut Pro 10 on the MacBook and this
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:39.320]   is the old generation MacBook. This is one of the, you know, one of the really old ones now that
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:44.760]   six months old but hasn't got this fancy new processor and it ran fine. The only time it
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:48.600]   hiccoped was when it was doing lots of sort of background rendering. But it sort of makes you
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.680]   think, well, and it's such a pain I've had to go somewhere and do something to move from a desktop
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:57.480]   to my laptop. So, you know, I'm seriously considering moving to a laptop as my primary machine even
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.640]   to do my editing on. Still give the Mac Pro and then just use that as like a render farm, you know,
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.520]   when I actually do the heavy lifting. But these new MacBooks, I mean, the same, the performance
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:11.800]   on them is in some cases, like two and a half times the previous MacBook Air plus there's also
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:17.080]   some on-chip video encoding and decoding capabilities as well. So we'll have to see how that works. But,
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:23.160]   you know, I could very well see myself moving from the Mac Pro to a decent spec MacBook Air or MacBook
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.000]   Pro. And they're just having one of these fantastic new Thunderbolt monitors.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.920]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's talk about the hardware in just a bit. In terms of security, you won't
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:38.520]   notice it. But Syracuse, it talks about the fact that sandboxing is now part of the OS. And in fact,
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:44.600]   starting in November, all Mac apps sold in the app store must sandbox, which is a separation of
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:51.400]   one process from another so that corruption cannot spread. You've got privilege separation,
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:57.880]   you've got enhanced keychain, you've got cryptographic signatures to lock stuff down.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:06.120]   Yeah, can you have him call the ISD inline? Yeah, that'd be great. So we're going to have
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.760]   John Syracuse a call just so we can applaud him and then he'll hang up. He's too tired to talk
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:16.680]   from one in a few minutes. But I'll put the ISD online on if he calls, we'll hear him.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:21.880]   We'll hear him call in. So this is, you know, Apple has always been very careful not to
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:26.440]   trumpet security because to do so would imply that there's a need for security.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.960]   Obviously, though, there is and they're paying attention to it. And it sounds like they've done
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:35.240]   some some good things in that regard. Any thoughts there gentlemen before I move on?
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:41.640]   Yeah, I think General users will just see the cosmetic changes to line and not really have
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:46.200]   the appreciation of what's going on under the hood. But it's very difficult to put that across to
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:51.880]   to anybody really. Right. Hopefully that will have the same situation we've had for years where
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:57.640]   there are just no significant incidents of nasty wherever being released and it has to be a Mac device.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:02.920]   Well, I'm actually even even keener to know about the new file vault encryption.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.600]   Where now it's the file vault encryption will now extend to the entire volume.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:11.400]   And it's going to be possible to remote wipe the entire drive. So if it gets lost or stolen,
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:16.680]   you have to make that choice between, okay, do I keep my security spyware installed so I can
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.960]   keep taking secret pictures of the guy who stole it? Or do I do I ignite the bomb so that make
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:26.520]   sure that he can't get access to any of the data that's on it? So that's a feature a lot of people
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:34.440]   gonna like. Are we gonna miss Rosetta? The question is, are you a quick and user or you're not a
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:38.520]   quick and user? It's most like quick and user. How are you enjoying that hand churn butter?
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:46.600]   Rosetta is the ability to write a power PC code. It was included in every version of OS 10 all the
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:50.360]   way up to Snow Leopard. It is now for the first time not there. There's no even download that you
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:57.480]   can do. There's nothing. You just can't run power PC code. Period. It's been what how many years?
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:04.680]   Five years four or five years. So I guess that's not unreasonable. What do you do though if you
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:08.120]   want to run quick and I guess they're putting some stuff in quick and that will let you perhaps
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:12.680]   run quick and the most important thing that message to get out today is to make sure that
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   if you are running quick and the last thing you need to do before you install a line is make
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:22.440]   sure you export your data. You're gonna have a shiny new Mac that can't even run quick and
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.920]   to export your data again. So you're just gonna make sure you keep that in mind. Syracuse mentions
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.920]   the fact that he uses a very old version of Photoshop. Doesn't use Photoshop enough to justify the
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   hundreds of dollars to upgrade to an Intel version but it runs just fine and he actually he's right
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:40.680]   that Rosetta actually in some cases runs faster on a late model Mac with Intel than it did on a power
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:47.480]   PC. But you just those people you're just gonna be left behind I guess. What can you say?
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:53.160]   There is a lot if you're a programmer and I'll ask John about it because he is a programmer but
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:59.400]   there's a lot new stuff in the programming environment including a new garbage collection model.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:06.680]   Completely rewritten compiler IDE, new syntax and Objective-C.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:13.400]   Memory management has been changed.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:22.040]   It's it's it's and there's something called ARC. ARC. But I'll have to ask John about that because
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:30.120]   that's that's really beyond my Ken OS. Ken let's let's talk about the new hardware in just a moment
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:35.480]   and John Syracuse will join us just for a victory lap before he goes back to bed. We woke him up.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.680]   [Laughter]
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:43.160]   You may not be you may not be so so excited about this new hardware that we're going to talk about

[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:21.960]   don't know if we've talked since tech tv days it seems it's been a long time maybe we have
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:30.120]   jillians jillians that i'm dead at jillians oh yeah remember that yeah mac at mac world expo
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:35.880]   also here a guy we see an awful lot considering he lives in uh oxford england on mccallister or
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:42.600]   liver pool liver pool liver pool sorry liver pool okay and I hope I live her puddly and was not
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.720]   offensive to you a couple of days ago no that was fine I'm just glad you corrected yourself I was
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:56.040]   cockney at first yeah still not quarks but well harris is from oxford that's wrong
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:00.440]   macallisters from he's a liver puddly and I didn't forgive you for my uh for for
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:05.800]   for dissing me on my music choice well now that you deserve that actually I have to say I was
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:13.320]   really glad to know a few a few uh europeans because when spotify I hit the u.s i could go to you and
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:17.800]   cedric and gone from france and have have list because you guys have had it for a while yeah
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:24.600]   and done you were right it is great it's a great service yeah fantastic I couldn't I couldn't really
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.600]   and I think there's still some people who probably don't think it's better than say rdo or
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:34.520]   mog or rhapsody or naps or whatever the zoom marketplace zoom pass but I think it is I do
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.800]   something about it I don't know what I can't quite put my finger on it but I really enjoy it and
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:42.200]   partly it's that because you're my facebook friend as soon as I logged into facebook with
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:46.680]   spotify there are your playlists I found a really great service it's not really applicable to to
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:49.560]   the u.s yeah i don't think but there's a there's a service i'll have to dig it out and perhaps
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:54.520]   give you the show no it's but for but uk and european people it's a service that uh goes ahead and
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:57:01.160]   mashes up the bbc playlist so that if you i have it i did it oh that's brilliant it's basically
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:07.400]   you you subscribe to a channel that is a bbc a bbc radio station and then it lists all the songs
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:11.240]   that they played the day before without any of the djs talking over them and you can just play them
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:17.480]   and you're fantastic it leverages i think the thing i'm thinking this is really the thing that
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:23.160]   makes spotify what it is the fact that you can click a url on a page and it will load that playlist
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:29.240]   to spotify that by itself i think because it means that you can have websites with spotify
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.920]   playlists and stuff that's right that's right and that's one of the that's how this thing works
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:39.320]   i is it bibla bibla fi bibla fi seems to ring a bell yes i think that's it because i have all these
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:49.640]   bibla fly playlists yeah top albums yeah indie rock folk and six music which i presume is bbc six
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:57.960]   so this is the stuff they played last night yeah mine is the tj's i love it and it's automatically
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:03.160]   updated i mean it's just little things like that but the reason i disjose because you had it wasn't
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:08.840]   you know i like zz top it was the daran daran i think they really uh was that uh well to be
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:13.240]   honest uh yeah i didn't really put uh i didn't pay much close attention to those public lists but
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:19.240]   i've rectified that sin so you have what happened they're all gone oh no if you click on the button
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:25.960]   at the bottom oh so you're all 682 tracks there we go my top tracks so you have one massive playlist
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.360]   one big playlist yeah see i'm thinking now maybe i'll just go ahead and stick with rhapsody because
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:35.000]   i've got plenty of playlists that i don't need anybody to know what to do you don't have to publish
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.640]   them all right don no you don't have to you can select them okay but that was the secret to
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.760]   don's embarrassment is that apparently he he had published them all but that without knowing
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:52.200]   it's raining men is a peppy peppy tune daran daran baby now i was just teasing you and it's
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:56.520]   it's i thought that this was the cool thing is i could see your uh your uh playlists i really love
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:02.840]   that uh all right let's talk about the new hardware buy buy white macbook no more mac books baby
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:09.880]   uh that was the thousand dollar plastic offering the last plastic uh laptop are we surprised are we
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:15.000]   regretting it it's the one that i have to say a lot of schools bought well do you think that they're
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.200]   going to when they when they ditch the 17 inch uh i mac a few years ago the white i mac a few years
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.600]   ago they still left it available for education do you think they maybe they'll do you think
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.280]   they leave it available for education or do you think they put education either to the
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:36.680]   macbook air or to the ipad a 999 air to me i mean it's a smaller drive that's the difference yeah
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:42.760]   is just it's just a great student device i think it's like it seems like it would be at the same
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:48.520]   time uh tem cook did say again on the conference call um that last quarter they actually sold more
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:54.600]   ipads to k through 12 then they sold uh max chat rooms telling me that yes edu still has access to
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:59.400]   the white macbook air linsider says that uh right available to education institutions only right
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.640]   okay okay well i guess that makes sense i'll all not i'll channel backlog and non-direct
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.920]   institution customers we'll see their orders canceled effectively wow
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:12.600]   wow canceled not replaced with something else but i guess it makes sense yeah i thought i did
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:17.320]   think that was an interesting move for me because they are now really saying that a macbook air is
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.840]   is as good as any other mac by saying that they're replacing the the volks mac the one that's there's
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:27.960]   the most affordable we they could they could they could credibly say that their 999 dollar macbook
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:34.200]   nothing was a conventional 15 inch notebook that's compatible that's competitive with premium like
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.640]   800 to a thousand dollar uh windows notebooks now they really don't have that because now when
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:44.040]   you do the comparisons it's and what kind of awful to do do i get blu ray no you don't get an
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:49.080]   awful drive well do i at least get a 500 no you get 64 gigs of flash memory for that money so that's
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:55.560]   it's i i do think that's an interesting move it was the last uh core two was it not i mean are we now
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:04.040]   all i5 i think even the minis now are i5 or i7 yeah um so that makes sense i mean that's the modern
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:09.240]   apple processor uh my instead is health and safety with these new mapper cars with schools i mean
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.640]   see how sharp they are yeah at least like they're probably confident they can like hurt somebody
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.480]   with the air if you're gonna get shivved with something do you want it to be at the old toothbrush
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.640]   or the most stylish and powerful ultra light notebook on the market they're just going to say
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.680]   what's the uh what's the james bon villain who could cut people's heads up a job exactly this is
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:34.280]   like a this is the laptop for him odd jobs laptop uh i i am a huge air fan and i have to say air with
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   lion gives me kind of i i feel like it's now more like an ipad it's the best of everything i just
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:47.480]   really is a very nice fit um of course i put windows 7 on my air too you last night but
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:53.720]   did you you asked earlier were we surprised or were we sad i mean i've sort of been waiting for
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.680]   this to happen for a while i mean every time there was an update i sort of expected okay that
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.080]   next time it's gonna be gone i mean were you guys surprised that it finally went away as far as
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:08.920]   the public was done it was time i really was told i i am you are ready really well again i
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:15.240]   remember i think that they that a affordable for apple at least an affordable conventional 15 inch
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:20.120]   notebook served a great many purposes for apple and because right now we're back to where we were
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.640]   a few years ago where if someone asks me whether they should be buying a macbook or a window a
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.160]   windows notebook and i'm at the point where i have to explain to them well here's what you
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.720]   can you wouldn't get for a thousand dollars if you buy a mac notebook here's what you can get for
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.040]   thousand dollars if you buy a windows notebook a windows notebook you're talking about practically
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:44.040]   a top of the line machine great build quality great service every feature you could possibly want
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.720]   something that could really do the job of a desktop and now for that same for a hundred
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:53.880]   dollars more than that really you're talking about tiny screen no optical drive tiny amount of
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:03:00.040]   storage no ethernet two-weiss it's i'm i'm so that that's why i'm a little bit surprised
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.080]   i they're apples definitely confident about what they're doing over the over the next two or three
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.040]   years but as a son who sometimes it has to answer that question i now have to say
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:13.960]   it's causing it costs a lot more money but it really is worth it with all the you know it'd be
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:20.760]   nice if they had a lower price air i guess i mean 999 you get a 1.6 gigahertz core i5
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:28.360]   two gigs of memory it's kind of light 64 gig drive a lot of people will say that's too small and
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.920]   across the board on the air you only get the intel ht graphics the mother board graphics
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:37.640]   which uses ram by the way doesn't have its own dedicated ram
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:45.480]   i you know that a comparable windows laptop we're talking 300 bucks 400 bucks maybe
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.000]   well yeah but it's the whole thing right where apples pushing everybody to
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.560]   iOS devices i mean they're pushing they've got this vision if you want something that cheap
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.960]   buy an ipad is that we is that what that was telling you oh i think that's i mean i think
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:03.400]   for most people an ipad is enough i mean this group is not really a good representation right i mean
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.320]   for my mom an ipad would be enough for my dad for a lot of my friends an ipad would be enough
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:12.440]   computer it would not only be enough it'd be the right choice for a lot of people it depends i mean
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:19.160]   a few months ago my aunt needed a new machine she was replacing her like 1993 like Pentium 3
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:25.320]   desktop compact desktop and she wanted to get a Mac and so we talked about it and i showed her
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:30.760]   the ipad but it was a little bit too different for her she just she wanted to she there's something
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:36.680]   reassuring about keyboard disks so i can play DVDs on my on my bus trips so a lot of those people
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:44.680]   buy windows machines and that's a fact they buy they buy netbooks they buy underpowered windows
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:50.520]   machines but they buy windows machines i have to say that with the iosification
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:57.720]   of flying the people my well my wife's a good example she has a 13 inch macbook and it was too
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:03.240]   much for her to figure out she's so much happier with the ipad i think though in some of the things
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:08.520]   they've done with lion will make that macbook much more palatable for her and it will suddenly be
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:15.160]   the right thing for her again i don't know i think the air is such a nice device but it's
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:19.960]   price-wise you're right Andy it's tough it's a tough tough pitch do you think that's the way
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.800]   they're pushing it i mean are they pushing it to make the laptops and the computer is more
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.600]   palatable to people are they pushing are they pushing the iosification of lion to make
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.880]   the ios devices more palatable to compute oh that's interesting i mean to people who i mean like
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.120]   Andy was saying about his aunt she's more comfortable with the keyboard she's more comfortable with
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.840]   with the computer with the monitor i mean these are these are these are kind of issues that
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:47.640]   we're in this weird place right now where we had to convince people for a very long time and by
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.040]   we i mean industry had to convince people for a very long time no you really do need a computer
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:57.080]   and now apple's going no you don't really need a computer what you need is this thing that does
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.840]   all the stuff that a computer did and some other stuff too but we know that actually the ipad's
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.960]   a computer right really but most people i mean that's a hard sell we talked about that on the
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:11.160]   on the call and show last week i mean technically the iphone's a computer technically the ipad
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.560]   touches computer technically the ipad's a computer but none of them feel like a computer and that
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.320]   i guess could go back to that whole stitching thing although why you want a computer to feel like a
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:25.480]   paper calendar is is kind of weird but i mean they do some stuff on the ipad to make it feel like a
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:30.920]   computer and technically it is but it's still there's a mental hurdle if i don't have a physical
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.280]   keyboard then i don't have what i need well there is i have to point out a a six hundred dollar
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:43.560]   mac which is actually pretty compelling the new mac mini i think is very nice now
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:49.240]   they've put them i5 and i7's in them thunderbolt by the way thunderbolts across the board of course
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:57.240]   that's that's that's a given and and it starts at 599 and for 599 you get a 2.3 gigahertz i5
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.200]   two gigs of memory a 500 gig hard drive you're still in getting motherboard graphics but that's
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:10.120]   that's a pretty compelling device you spend 799 you're going to get a fat little faster i5 and
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:15.720]   more memory and of course you can configure all of these i should have showed that with the
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:23.640]   with the oh here's john syrucusa hey john are you there john can you hear me
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:31.160]   hello john i heard him pick up and then he hung up okay i don't know what happened
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.640]   maybe he can't hear me
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:41.560]   well to continue on maybe he'll say something in a moment um you could put an i7 in there for
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.960]   an additional hundred dollars that's not too bad eight gigs for two hundred dollars you could put an
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.720]   ssd in it six hundred dollars but that's kind of nice i think this is uh and by the way with the
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:56.920]   thunderbolt display easy for a thousand bucks to add a 27 inch monitor now you basically got an iMac
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:05.160]   right without a keyboard and mouse and an iMac price that's 2,500 bucks let's add the mouse
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:11.240]   let's add the keyboard hey by the way should people now buy mice or trackpads
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:15.720]   trackpads seems like that's the way to go even if you if you're looking at the magic mouse
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:22.280]   i i try to use a line with the magic mouse and i regret the fact that the magic mouse is so light
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:27.560]   and easy to throw new recommendation i think you're right and whatever you do don't buy a windows
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:33.480]   mouse because you're gonna the scroll scroll it's gonna confuse the laddie i think you're right i
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:37.640]   think the i want to try it with the trackpad on my uh on my new iMac but i'm thinking the trackpad
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:43.800]   is now the uh input device of choice what do you think you do lose a certain amount of precision
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:48.600]   that's that's the only thing with the trackpad and and for prolonged use i find it can be a bit of
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.160]   a strain to use the trackpad all the time but um i mean it fully supports the gestures which is
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:57.800]   great that's why i'm still trying to sort of use my pen tablet and the trackpad so i have
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.400]   the pen tablet on the on the right hand side and the trackpad on the left hand side of the keyboard
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:05.720]   so that i can sort of use uh gestures with one hand and my pen with the other and that
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.440]   actually works okay once you get used to the reverse scrolling side of thing
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:13.000]   are you naturally ambidextrous? not really
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.680]   he just looks that way i think i have another thing on the left hand side as well so no i sort of
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:27.800]   told myself to be like that hey john can you hear me now hi john i hear you breathing i don't know
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:35.240]   why you can't hear me is it something i'm post-reading coma yeah he's he's he's just
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:40.120]   liquid liquids and glucose you forgot to push the liquids just he just came on to breathe for us
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:48.280]   john syracusa is an author at ours technica who is known now for his amazing you know lengthy
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:53.560]   thoughtful pieces uh on os 10 he started i think he started doing it with leopard snow leopard
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:58.440]   certainly and uh now os 10 lion 27 000 words later can you hear me now john
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.680]   no
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:09.960]   you know even john syracusa's silence is illuminating it's like volleical detail authoritative
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.560]   i'll take john syracusa's silence against against gizmodos you know 8 000 pages
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.720]   when it went over any day we know we knew the mini needed an update but are we surprised that
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.720]   the mini is as powerful as this no it's it's kind of the embedded system that that apple makes
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:31.240]   because every time i see one in operation it's usually someplace that's oddly out of place either
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.840]   it's hidden behind a tv in a living room or it's hidden inside a server closet with like a hundred
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.880]   like blade servers doing something else uh doing something else entirely i'm not sure that i ever
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:47.800]   met anybody who given the option wouldn't they needed to get a a conventional desktop Mac that
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:53.160]   they decided to get a mac mini then attach a monitor to it i'm quite surprised that the the
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:57.960]   weather taken away the dvd and that came as a bit of a shock because they did that with the server
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:02.280]   on the old Mac mini but now there's no optical drive in which is known as you're right if you
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.880]   have to buy as an external although it's stacked it would stack nicely but it makes it so much
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:11.720]   thinner this way yeah yeah but um it's it's quite um it struck me really that's that's quite a brave
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.720]   move to take i suppose it again that's the way they're going there isn't it i mean the the macbook
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.440]   as a uh having the optical drives but uh for the mac mini nuts have one either i thought that was
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:30.440]   quite a significant move i had to say i look at these and they look so sexy and elegant i almost
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.080]   want to buy one even though i have no use for whatsoever it's like i i looked at space next to
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:40.280]   my tv and think you know but i i could i could find a use for macintosh because who cooked my tv
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:46.040]   set it didn't take long though with with upgrading to get it to 2600 bucks yeah at that point it's
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:55.080]   like yeah maybe not at 600 bucks okay uh but uh as soon as soon as you start putting uh options in
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.800]   there i guess that that that that kind of middle priced one by the way there is a lion's server
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.280]   version what's the story of lion's server i thought that was going to be included with lion is that
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:11.480]   still a separate product yeah it's 45 dollars isn't it oh okay all right yeah okay i don't remember
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.080]   the exact price but it was included with the uh it was included with the developer builds and
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:20.680]   everybody you know people who talk about it or talk against the nda or whatever we're saying oh
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.720]   it's going to be included and then it came out that it wasn't going to be included and people
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.320]   were like hey that's a screw job we thought it was going to be included runs because you know people
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:33.080]   were talking about things they weren't but 45 bucks is not exactly pricey is that the right price
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:36.120]   because it's somewhere around there i can't remember exactly exactly yeah
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:42.040]   all right we're going to try to get john on via skype here
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.760]   oh boy we're in skype is the safety fallback
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:54.920]   maybe the fallback physician while you're trying to get him forgive me this is my first time can i
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.160]   quickly do the brady bunch thing because i've never done the i know i kind of is cool okay so
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.680]   so there's so now i'm looking down at andy right uh sort of yeah yeah okay maybe it'll help if i
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:12.040]   sing if i sing a song here's a story of some nerdy guys who got together to talk about the mac
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:21.000]   all right thank you i do of them head hair of nothing one of them had a hat on and it's
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:29.880]   four socks sorry i well it's a boston hat so you can't really you know then put the hat on thing
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:36.840]   i'm telling you we're a post all stop break team okay john syrik here's it can you hear me now
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:42.040]   i can't hear you now oh he sounds like he's so tired john syrik here's it we just all wanted to
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:50.440]   give you a standing ovation thank you thank you very much for an amazing 27 000 word article
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:57.160]   that even humbles andy and acco which is saying quite a bit you you are the gay tileses of of
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:05.400]   back journalism we're waiting for the movie option are you exhausted john i'm a little tired yeah
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.880]   how so you you're obviously you started this with the developer edition
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:16.120]   yeah and not only did i started a long time ago i had to finish it on july first more or less
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.840]   but but i'm sure you waited until this morning to kind of make dot the eyes right to make sure
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.680]   that it's hard to do that you know once once the thing goes into sort of the workflow making the
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.680]   e-book versions and everything and getting copy edited and stuff like that it's hard to make those
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.520]   last minute changes well here you can make it now on mac break weekly is there anything that you
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:38.200]   want it all looked accurate well there's there's some mistakes most of them have been corrected in
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.600]   the online version by now okay the e-book versions probably have to wait till tomorrow to get all the
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:49.080]   corrections in uh but was there anything substantial apple changed from the gold master to this release
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.600]   oh i haven't even downloaded the retail version so i don't know do you want to go back to snow
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:00.440]   leverage john i'm still really using windows machine for the next month just until the shakes go away
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:06.120]   so john we've kind of actually used your articles at template for going through a lot of the
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.200]   features but then you started talking about things like ark and and garbage collection we just had
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:18.280]   to stop is but as a developer uh what do you think that's pretty open end question what do i think
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:25.320]   of what uh the the uh changes under the hood i think they're all positive the underhood changes are
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:30.120]   rarely controversial like they don't do things like there's no equivalent of the stitched leather
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.120]   calendar in the under the hood changes they're always doing things that are moving the ball forward
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.040]   by some amount the only thing you can really get mad about is you know they didn't they didn't do
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:42.520]   enough internally like i spent a while complaining about the lack of a new file system and explaining
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:47.080]   trying to explain why even care about stuff like that right uh versioning it might have been a lot
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:52.200]   easier with zfs for instance you know you never know what could have been remember when people
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.840]   wanted apple to buy b and they bought next and people are upset i mean you can't say how would it
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.920]   have turned out if they bought b or they should have bought b or but you know hindsight's 2020 so i
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:06.280]   can't say whether zfs would have been bad i can say the zfs has way more features and is much more
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:11.400]   modern than hfs plus but but something something's got to be happen there and it's been a long time
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.640]   and nothing has happened so that continues to be frustrating but that's not an example of
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:19.960]   them doing something i don't like it's just an example of them not changing enough you know i
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.840]   have to say that there isn't there are under the hood changes which some might complain about uh
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:30.120]   for instance um we've talking about this versioning the fact that applications really don't quit anymore
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:35.880]   um those things might be a little confusing to users in the sense that especially early on they'll
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:41.480]   be hybrid situations where some apps will do the versioning some won't uh some will respond
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:47.720]   properly some won't to this you know shut down request um at least initially there this some of
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.120]   these under hood changes could be a little disconcerting even to end users well you know you
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:57.400]   what else can you do you have to get find somebody to get from here to there yeah yeah that makes
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:02.600]   sense what's your favorite feature then we'll let you go back to bed hmm uh
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:08.520]   is there i got to say that i think the restore is my favorite feature because i love applications
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.040]   that already have that feature you know web browsers have added for a long time i use bb edit
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:15.800]   which has the auto restore and i want that to be in every one of my applications because i hate
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:20.920]   quitting an application and then reopening and not remembering what i was doing yeah no i like it too
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.920]   it's ahead of me yep john syrq says once again thank you we just wanted to give you a little
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:31.880]   victory lap here well done golf club all around thank you i don't i don't overbuild the microphone
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:39.960]   just that really was like i thought i was like an hour and a half away from like finishing my
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:45.160]   my review and then like i just spent i i think i must have gone through just like the first
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:50.920]   five sections of syrq uses like no i that's that's that's where the that's where the game is right
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:57.480]   now that's that's the level that i have to damn it i got actually i got to actually get to work really
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:04.280]   hard on this note thank you john we'll let you go okay take care john syrq has ours
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:09.240]   technica and and that is an important point by the way that you can now not only read it online at
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:15.720]   ours technica dot com uh 27 000 words but you can get an e-book and a pdf as well on that site and
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.840]   so if you want to kind of have it on your kindle or on your iphone and or your ipad and read this at
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.800]   your leisure uh and more importantly and i think they say this on this ours site it is a way of
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:32.120]   supporting long-form journalism uh and i i think uh deserves frankly the whatever is four bucks
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:42.760]   so thank you john take care bye bye he just fell fell back asleep he did he sounded a little tired
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:48.200]   we're gonna take a break and come back with the earnings well let's we want to do earnings now
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:52.840]   and then we'll take a break and come back with the with the picks yeah maybe highlights can of the
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.200]   earnings call it was a good quarter yes it was a very good quarter yes i mean the one thing
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:04.600]   i i mean it was insane it was an insanely good quarter uh record number of iphone sold record
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:09.480]   number of ipads yeah it's hard to not sell a record number of ipads it seems right now i mean
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:17.640]   as long as they're delivering okay because i mean they were uh well that's not i'm sorry i don't know
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:23.000]   what to say except that it was an insanely good quarter but the ipad outsold the mac actually that's
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.880]   not new but it's a bigger business than the mac overall right uh more money to be made they sold
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:37.480]   twice as many ipads as mac's last quarter um i think that's interesting uh ipod sales are dropping
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:43.240]   rapidly they they didn't highlight that but they're down 20 percent year over year right although
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.560]   they still dominate the market and they also they weren't as bad as most people thought they were
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:52.600]   going to be as far as ipod sales right um it didn't quite hit the level of mac sales that everybody
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.360]   thought they were going to and i thought those questions around that katie uberty asked um
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:03.000]   tim cook about that um and i love this answer you know somebody else had asked to like
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   well why why sequentially why quarter over quarter is this so bad and he's like we're not looking
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.320]   quarter over quarter we're looking year over year but i'll answer your question um same kind of thing
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.560]   with uh with katie uberty why why were the sales not quite as good as everybody expected
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:20.920]   of course everybody's looking for him to say that the ipad is uh cannibalizing the mac
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.000]   which he copped to he said yeah there were probably some people who were choosing that they were
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.120]   also probably some people who were waiting for lion which you know subtextually means that they're
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:34.360]   also waiting for the new machines he also said it's and i like this it's kind of cannibalizing windows
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:41.080]   sales even worse right yeah that was that was funny i mean they were it's the mac sales i don't think
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.200]   anybody is really worried about mac sales because it was still the most max they've ever sold in the
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:50.040]   quarter right um there was just there was a lot of really i love the q and a of the uh of the earnings
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.920]   call the q and a is always fascinating that's also where you get the hint that there's going to be
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.360]   i mean not like we didn't know that there's going to be an iphone five and of course we still don't
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:02.600]   technically know that there's going to be an iphone five but we started getting hints of some major
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:09.400]   product transition in september opin opinheimer said there's quote a lot going on this fall right
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.600]   right and he also apparently i missed this during the call but he also apparently hinted at um new
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:19.400]   content deals for iTunes as far as video goes which is kind of an interesting thing especially
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:24.280]   where they keep playing with apple tv as a hobby does that mean you could get an ala cart channel
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:28.360]   does that mean it's just going to be more movies i said last uh on today's macros can oh i hope
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:28.460]   it's beetles movies r
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:37.320]   that kind of interesting that i'm kind of no offense to deliver puddly and on the call
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.040]   sorry i forgot
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:46.680]   it's just i mean it was it was really it was a really i mean just insanely good as far as as
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:51.160]   far as you know money as far as sales as far as all that stuff but then just the glimpse of of
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:55.880]   where they're going there was one other thing that i found really fascinating and i don't know if i'm
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:02.360]   if i'm looking for something about which to worry um heavy heavy emphasis on international
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.080]   yeah and i don't i don't know if that has to do with just hey look how good we're doing
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.960]   internationally or if that has to do with okay wall streets worried about how things are going
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.120]   economically here in the states right now so let's also point out yeah the fortune 500 is doing
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:20.440]   great with this but look at these global 500 companies well but i think there is important for
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:24.600]   apple because apple's never done well internationally so that is that that is a victory
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:28.840]   no no i'm not i mean don't misunderstand me i'm not saying that they were pulling some sort of
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:34.760]   misdirection with that right it felt like a heavier emphasis than it's been in the past although
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.640]   maybe it gets to be a heavier emphasis than it's been in the past because they're more
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:40.200]   successful now than they've been in the past i mean maybe that's all there is to it
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:49.000]   and amazing 76.2 billion dollars in cash they're gonna they're gonna buy the moon i mean
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:55.800]   what's really interesting is people uh analysts have finally stopped because like this was about
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:00.520]   a year ago when they hit what 30 something billion 40 something billion then analysts were like okay
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:04.200]   it's it's far too worrisome they get too much money they're gonna buy something stupid like every
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:09.560]   hat company in the world or something like that um and now and now that's like seven
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:16.280]   you could you could dominate the buggy whip industry and now they've got some
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.560]   one since they've become bad school they're asking that anymore is it because now they could
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:24.120]   spend 30 billion dollars on every hat company in the world and still have 46 billion dollars
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:28.760]   at some point i don't know i mean like i'm not i'm not an expert on corporate governance or anything
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:34.920]   but uh you would think at some point there's pressure from people to do something with this
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:39.640]   maybe buy back stock at at the very least of course you're stocking a record high right now
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:45.160]   maybe that not the time to buy it back who was it Steve Jobs on the fourth quarter earnings call
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:50.360]   last year beat the tar out of somebody i think it was Tony Sakinagi i can't remember who from
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:56.360]   uh Bernstein um he did i mean he was basically pushing him on that what are you gonna do with
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:59.880]   the money why don't you buy back shares why don't you do this and jobs was basically like you're
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:06.520]   you're thinking small you don't get it we've got ideas we don't shut up well what okay so they got
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.120]   a piggy bank they're saving up for something what the hell could it be at this point
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:19.000]   ExxonMobil Australia i don't know it's a lot of money wait i guess the question i have there was
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.760]   is it worrisome i mean what stupid things have they bought i mean i don't i still don't understand
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:29.160]   law law i don't i mean it was it was the big deal when you compare it to the money in the bank
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.160]   right well no i mean i understand buying law i don't understand buying law other than that
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:38.680]   using it right right but then i mean that was what i mean jobs walks around with that much
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.320]   money in his back pocket what they spent on law all right so yeah yeah i don't know what
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.200]   we're in positions yeah sorry okay most of the organizations are made up in fairly low key
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:52.360]   haven't they they don't really spend a ton of money on acquisitions well even that building is
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.720]   not going to cost what's the building going to cost to ten billion i mean it's not even that's not
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:03.400]   how much do they what was the amount was like was like a quarter of a billion dollars that they spent
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:10.200]   on um what was the semiconductor company oh yeah yeah um vasming yeah yeah p_a_s_sming yeah
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:14.840]   yeah they spent like a quarter of a billion dollars on that and that is now at the heart of the uh
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:19.240]   of the iphone right in the ipad right and the ipad touch and everybody says it'll eventually
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.680]   be the heart right it's it's an insanely good buy for a quarter of a billion dollars
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.280]   yeah anyway yeah the money is crazy how much is sprint worth
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:38.040]   seven billion dollars really they could buy sprint and they still have 72 million dollars
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:44.120]   72 billion dollars left it's kind of a crazy idea what would they do with my well yeah wouldn't if
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:52.680]   you bought a telco wireless carrier right and you stopped selling iPhones through all the others
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:58.200]   you'd basically own the business right isn't the iPhone arriving every it'd be them versus
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:03.320]   android that's sort of the same thing though i'm sorry not to get way off track but it's sort of
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.280]   the same thing is when everybody says apple's gonna get into a television television i find it hard
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.360]   to believe because i think enough people have enough headaches making tbs and i think apple would
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:16.360]   just like to ride along with that exactly what Andy's been saying all along yep he's so why would
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:21.800]   it why would apple want a wireless company i mean let let at and t and t mobile and i'm sorry at and
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.040]   t mobile and i guess so because they're getting they're getting all the good stuff out of them
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:29.720]   they without yeah without actually having to run the company they're getting six hundred twenty
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.240]   nine dollars for every i-phone right that sounds like an okay thick oh and and then when something
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:40.280]   goes wrong with the service they'll call call call at and t don't call us i'm good to me okay
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:45.400]   let's uh what could they what could they do well i don't know it's a it is a fun thing to think
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.120]   about because it's so much money now yeah i mean it's not even as though they're investing in r&d i
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.560]   mean the the r&d was just two percent two point two percent i think r&d so i mean what do they
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:01.320]   put it in in are they putting it in uh cds i mean what do they what do they have they're investing it
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:06.920]   in uh what i mean what are they doing with it well do you think it could actually and do you think
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.440]   it could actually be a simple i read some article recently that said the reason that they're not
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:15.320]   spending their money the reason they're not buying back shares is because uh steve jobs very well
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.080]   remembers when apple was on robes that's right when they had almost no money he doesn't want to
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:23.480]   have to go hat and hand to microsoft again and say give me a hundred million dude because we're
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.840]   gonna go bankrupt tomorrow so is this like a depression era story exactly you know i remember
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:33.400]   when we couldn't you know get all the right back then they they didn't need the hundred fifty million
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:39.240]   they didn't need it at the time you mean they they at the my rotation is my my recollection is
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.920]   that at the time if they could have gotten stockholder support they could have bought themselves out
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:48.520]   okay for the problems with the current management there is no way that they're going to be a private
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:53.000]   company they're just going to sell to somebody else i i saw your point is well taken i mean this
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.880]   they might be that's that's probably part of the cultural dna to make sure that no one can ever
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:03.000]   push apple around apples in the business of pushing other people around all right now we are going
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.920]   to take a break for uh and then get back with our picks of the week in just a moment right now i'd

[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.720]   edward norton kyanu kyanu rives whoa whoa
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:15.320]   dude i actually say whoa in the book at any point uh not not as far as i reach before i'm only about
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:18.760]   i'm only about a third of the way through it at this point but i'm looking for the yot-two
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:24.600]   unfamiliar fishes so this is about hawaii or what is this about it really is about the
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:29.400]   transition between uh hawaii being basically an independent independent state an independent
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:38.360]   kingdom and the series of problems that that nation was suffering that basically played into
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:43.240]   the hands of uh corporate interests that said great they've got all these resources they've got
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:47.640]   all these exports we can simply have these businesses just by sort of telling them that
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.800]   we're gonna come in we're gonna take over your government and we're gonna take care of all because
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:56.200]   you clearly can't can't take care of your own people and you know but what the United States
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.680]   government will come in and will fix you all up and it's really a sad story but as
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:06.040]   sarah vall has that way of saying these sort of things in a very matter of fact tone that
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:12.440]   neither minimizes it nor forces you to say and now join hands around the drum circle we will beat
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:19.800]   the drum once for every life lost to american imperialism do you are you now i like her voice
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:23.240]   there are people who hate her voice uh i presume since you're listening to it you like it
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:29.400]   it's it's it's a different voice i mean it's it really is it's so the sample and that's by the way
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:33.240]   one of the great things about audible.com is you can always listen to a sample of any book and
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.320]   hear what it sounds like they point out that these all these narrators just do a line or two they're
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:44.760]   doing the quotations it's mostly sarah on this right yeah i like her voice it's unusual it's
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:50.520]   just that it's so evenly matched to her writing it's hard to divorce her voice from what she writes
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:55.560]   yeah you wouldn't want her to read war and peace great gatsby maybe we'll go to plant bait
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:01.480]   but for any sarah vall book you don't want anybody but sarah vall reading it try it free audible.com/
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:06.920]   mac break you don't have to get this air of vowel book your choice of 75 000 titles but this
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:10.360]   this would be a good one i'm gonna put it on my list i always you know i love it and because you
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:15.560]   always recommend something i want to hear by the way my mac has rebooted so now an hour and 20
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:22.920]   minutes later took almost the whole show i think i have we'll see oh it's 10 lion on this 17 inch
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:33.080]   this is a pretty old one i should have checked it's intel yeah well presumably the installer would
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:39.080]   would say no you can't do this say so anything since about 2007 yeah this might be right at the
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:46.840]   edge there in fact i think i bought it kin at the mac world that we we did that uh adam adam's thing
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:55.160]   okay so what was that 2007 um 2008 i i say i i the one of jillians there because they were
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:33:00.120]   actually two yeah jillians yeah this is one of jillians and i think okay well then that was
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:06.600]   i don't when was that i may have problems with this i may regret what i just did all right well
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.520]   we'll find out in a moment i should have told it should i presume it would check it's an easy
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.800]   thing to figure out if you're i guess i would have i would have told you that yeah
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:21.960]   and i have just been handed this note that says today is the day the big bundle tie down from the
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:28.280]   control desk to the basement is now happening i don't know what that means we are we you know this

[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:40.840]   gonna be so cool so uh this is it this is the last day brick start twit.tv if you want to help us build
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:46.680]   this new brick house studio and that we thank everybody lots of people have donated it's really
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:51.240]   really a nice feeling let's get to our picks of the week i don't know can they tell you that we do
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:55.400]   this they did tell me that we do this the problem is i don't buy anything
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:01.560]   do you think you've got free lately that you like well no what i will say well i mean
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:09.320]   oh i got two ways i can go can i reacquaint people with the idea of the uh refurbished store yes
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:14.360]   that's a great apple because that's the computer that i'm using right now to talk to you was a uh
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:19.080]   february 2011 macbook pro so it was the ones that came out this year and i got it through the
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:23.640]   refurb store i think in the middle of may before i even heard that it was there it was just sort of
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:28.680]   cruising through there one day to see what was what and uh it was definitely time for me to upgrade
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:34.120]   and this was the machine i got so i would encourage people to revisit that even if it's not a new
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:40.280]   pick to you otherwise how do we get maybe i'll say lie in later tonight if you don't know yet
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:48.120]   if you go to what's stored on apple.com/referb is that how you get there i honestly don't know it's
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:52.760]   down in the bottom left hand corner. yeah there's a link so scroll down or push up or whatever you
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:58.760]   do now with lion. in most cases yes scroll push up scroll down push up in most cases these are
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:04.040]   i believe these are computers that were sold opened and returned immediately so they're
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:08.840]   can't be sold as new but they are in effect new and they're all a model and great deals.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:15.480]   i've got a family member who's still using one of the now extinct macbook whites but he got it through
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.080]   the refurbished store as well and it's it served him very well except for some time
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:23.160]   that he poured a glass of water on it because he wanted to clean the uh key point. really and how
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:31.160]   did that work for him? um well he paid a lot of money and got it or got something replaced i don't
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:36.600]   know got all the way to the genius bar before he told us that i was cleaning up the key
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:41.880]   for and he was like well and it just stopped working uh right after i spilled the water on it
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:47.640]   and really because that might have been a good thing to tell us before we got here we would
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.440]   we could have probably helped you or at the very least just known you know what we were in for once
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:58.360]   we got the genius bar yeah this happened how old the rock is laughter exactly no i think that's a
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:05.640]   great pick with our twitter feed someplace that genius macosken.com and if you go tonight what time
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:11.960]   do you start the yield call and show? oh golly uh 10 p.m. eastern 7 p.m. pacific other times in other
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:16.680]   parts of the planet and um we're sort of in transition right now it was on ustream but now it's on
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:23.880]   jestin tv for like at least the next two weeks so it's jestin.tv/macosken or follow me on twitter
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:31.080]   uh twitter.com/macoscan and i send out reminders and uh call in and and we'll have cake and you're
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:36.680]   just down the road a piece from here right? no i used to be i'm very far away now. well you moved away
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:41.160]   yeah i'm in i'm in buffalo new york actually now i would have i would have come by the uh cottage
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:46.280]   on the road because you know it never been and now you guys are gonna what's it gonna be like like
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:50.600]   a like a benetton now what are they turning the cottage into? yeah yeah we're turning into a benetton
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:38:01.880]   sleep that's 1985 super oh the kelly's have been it in mr uh don mccallister your pick of the week
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:07.240]   sir okay well i'll do two very quick ones i know i said such good ones okay well the first one is
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.200]   a piece of hardware that was released today that we didn't really touch on but i think it's worth
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:17.400]   mentioning as an apple laptop user i've always wanted a good laptop dock something that was very
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.320]   fully functional a minimal number of wires i could connect my laptop and i actually released one
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:27.160]   today but surprise surprise it's actually a display it's the thunderbolt 27 inch display this is pretty
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:32.120]   cool it's really clever built into there they've got um they've got a FaceTime camera at the HD
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:38.120]   camera they've got high quality audio three usb two ports a firewire 800 port surprisingly a gigabit
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:43.400]   ethernet port as well and this thunderbolt port so you can daisy chain it so basically you can
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:47.720]   you can take the maxafe connector from your display plug that into your laptop a single
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:52.680]   thunderbolt connector and then all those other things are then fully enabled so you've got this
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:58.760]   gigabit ethernet and all sorts at the back of your display so that's a really clever idea and
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:03.800]   neat way that they're actually done it quite expensive it's uh like $999 but that's the same
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:09.320]   as the 27 before so yeah they didn't raise the price or this functionality so i think that's a
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:14.120]   really neat solution so that's one end of the sky the other one is just a nice simple piece of
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:19.640]   software i'm really into markdown which is this text marker language i use several different bits
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:25.080]   of uh and the nice thing with markdown is you can create formatted documents just using basic text
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:31.080]   editors now some text editors do have uh sort of markdown support built-in others don't but there's
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:37.320]   this great new app called marked by a Brett Terpstra on the my cap store which basically gives you an
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.840]   independent preview of any markdown documents that you're working on so it's really clever how it
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.320]   works it's it's an application you basically start working on a text document in any text editor and
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.080]   then if you want to see a preview of it if you've used markdown formatting language you just drag
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:56.200]   it onto the marked application and then every time that you save your document it actually changes
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.120]   it's it reformats the display so you can actually see uh you know how your markdown is actually
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.760]   looking as you go along so it means you're no longer limited to text editors that just have
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.640]   markdown support you can basically use any text editor and get this uh ongoing preview as you
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.720]   as you work through your document and it has some extra features which has been able to copy
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:18.280]   the html out and some other things as well but it's really neat very very simple very uh very
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:25.000]   classy idea this is great i like marked down a lot i use it a lot yeah john john Gruber wrote that
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.320]   right yeah john john and someone else i think put some markdown together but there's tons and tons
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:35.160]   and especially on the ipad there's an awful lot of uh markdown apps but on the mac.net so many i use
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.440]   one called by word which is really good but if you're just using text editor something and you want
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:42.760]   to see what it looks like in markdown once you put the formatting on just get this marked application
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:46.680]   drag your file onto the and every time you save it it just refreshes and you can get it so that it
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:52.520]   sort of stays above the page so you can always see it it's a really neat idea marked from marktapp.com
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:59.080]   actually it's on the app store at 299 yeah thank you man last but not least mr and you're not co
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:05.000]   in your pick of the week oh i'm a bit late to the party but i i'll save lion as your pick of the
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:11.640]   week thank you because i am ready to show it there you go um i started messing around with the
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:18.840]   obviously everyone knows how much scorn ridicule and abuse the final cut x uh has been receiving
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:24.040]   but i think that's sort of uh overlooked the fact that they broke out a couple of really
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.880]   cool things used to be part of final cut and made them separate really cheap really affordable
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:33.720]   things and so i've been playing with motion which costs 49 bucks since their uh video canvas
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:40.440]   video making tool where if you if this if you want if there's a if there's a picture that you're
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:47.800]   took during vacation of like a of a of a tank in front of a in front of a uh vfw
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:51.640]   hall and you want to animate like a missile coming out of the cannon then blowing something up
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:57.560]   at the beach party or at you can do that in motion if you just have a situation where gosh
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:02.360]   i just i'm doing an i movie thing but i need this one scene i need someone to be on screen talking
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:07.240]   about a video that's also inset inside that frame as it's playing that's something that you can do
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.320]   that's that's a clip you can easily do with motion basically anything that involves like
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:16.760]   photoshop only with movies and moving elements uh on a canvas with the assistance of software that
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:21.160]   can simply say look i want you to put this missile right here i want you to animate it flying from
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:26.040]   here to here do motion blur have it spinning as it goes just do that for me thank you very much
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:31.640]   motion can handle that now it's not it's designed to integrate really well with final cut but you
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:35.880]   can use it really well with i movie all you have to do is if you have that one shot in which you want
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:40.040]   the missile be flying over someone's head while they're talking you while the while the your cousin
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:44.920]   is you know exchanging wedding vows with number number eight or number nine uh all you have to do
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:50.600]   is take that one little clip out of your i movie export it as an mp4 or export as a video clip put
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.720]   it into motion do that animation export that back again now you have that's the the the missile super
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:00.520]   pose over that that guy's head for that one clip then put it back into i movie you can't see the
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:05.240]   cut lines where this thing got export and put back in as far as anybody knows you did this all with
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:10.280]   an i movie and for forty nine dollar app that's a really cool thing it's a really cool to play with
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:17.400]   i agree by the way now uh an hour and twenty five minutes in but uh it did in fact preserve my
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:23.240]   settings and i like the new login screen i hadn't seen this uh before i like i like the linen i
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:27.400]   think it's pretty cool yeah it's everywhere isn't it it's it's sort of it's sort of like the the
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.920]   curtain that you look at before the show starts yeah that's what it is it's what it is and i don't
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:38.600]   know if that was my i think the lion was that my uh my picture before did they just decide i deserved
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:44.680]   to be a lion because my name's leo um my pick actually uh i haven't tried yet but something that
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.400]   just came out today and i wanted to point you to it we talked before about and i love the sonos five
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:56.680]   uh the the zone player um it is a great way to get music in every room it works really nicely
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:01.800]   with the iphone and they have an iphone doc you can buy it has its own low latency network that
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:08.360]   doesn't sit on top of your Wi-Fi which i like uh it works with mogg with rhapsody with rdio and
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:14.360]   with spotify and the only negative has been its really expensive three ninety nine for the uh zone
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:18.760]   player five now they've got a less expensive three speaker not five speaker but three speaker
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:23.640]   system the play three and they've actually rebranded everything so this is the play five the play
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:31.000]   three it's two ninety nine uh and i really think if you're looking in a way to add music uh to your
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.560]   house and you'd like different music in each room you'd like it to work with your iTunes you'd like
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:42.360]   it to work uh with uh these on air services internet radio too i love the sonos and i'm glad that they
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:48.760]   now have a uh two ninety nine entry level sonos can't recommend it more highly we actually got five
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:54.440]   no six sonos devices for the the new studio so that we can listen listen to the twit in all the
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:59.800]   offices and so forth booting up i think i'm uh i think i'm good i think i'm good the setup assistant
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:04.440]   is running i guess it's gonna ask me some stuff but uh i didn't doesn't look like i lost anything
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:11.000]   anyway um so uh there you go took a whole mac break weekly but i got line installed
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.840]   and he and i got able to keep a company during this time
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:20.200]   had to do something i had to go out and pick up my dry cleaning and
