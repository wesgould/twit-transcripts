[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   This could be Episode 34.

[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   if you want to count the lost episode from last week.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly, I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   There is, there was an episode that was
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   deemed too ghastly to release last week.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And I guess there was a problem with the recording device.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   But, we've reconvened and you know, I think Merlin, you should just tell us
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   everything that you said last week again.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Do it like the FedEx guy does that commercial.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It's really, really fast.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Basically, I think it was like an hour and a half digital clipping.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Apparently, it was clipped to death.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Merlin Man's Back from the MerlinShow.com and Scott Borne from
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   podango.com and podcastingtricks.com.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I'm actually in the Pidango Production Studio.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Oh wow, it sounds really good.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Well, it's not done yet, but I'm in the studio.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Oh, you're in the room anyway.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I'm in the room.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   That jolly laugh, of course, who else, Andy, and not go from the Chicago
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Sun Times and the colossal waste of bandwidth, C-W-O-B.com.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Either either or or either.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I just love saying C-W-O-B.com.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   We're waiting for Alex Lindsey to join us, but we will begin and I will make sure
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   nothing is clipped and all is recorded and we will go right ahead.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I guess the biggest story, and there's just no question.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's the biggest story.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And I really wanted to do a show this week is Apple TV.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   How many show of hands Scott, you have one?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Actually, I tested one with a friend.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I did not buy one.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Okay.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Andy Naco has been testing one today, I think.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Yes, I am a newbie.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I have had one for exactly five hours and I've managed to mistake it for the hot plate of
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   my copy maker only once.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It's pretty warm.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's pretty warm.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   You wouldn't want to put it under blankets with you.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Actually, the cool thing is that it is about the right size for heating up like a pop-cout
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   or something.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I definitely want to try that.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Just put one of them chocolate ones on top of it.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Not enough to melt it, just enough to make it like airline fresh.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It does look like one of those fancy stoves.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It doesn't have a burner but just has an electroconductive surface.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.600]   I can talk with this conversation.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.000]   We actually did get a Jiffy Pop popcorn thing to make a few pops on one.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You kidding?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.160]   You were able to pop corn?
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.080]   It did not pop the whole thing but it made enough pops that we actually got a couple
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   of kernels.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.240]   That means it's hot enough to boil water.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   That's hot.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   Wow.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.600]   Because don't you make popcorn with boiling water?
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   I know I do.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.160]   Actually, I just bite at the movie theater usually.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.720]   Andy Enotko, Merlin Mann, Scott Born.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   We all have one, I guess.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   I have one.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   I got one on Friday.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.440]   I don't want Friday and I have been using the crap out of it.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   I love it.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.880]   I take back everything I said, all of my naysaying.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   Really?
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   No, I got it.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   Yeah, I don't take back all of it.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   Some of it sucks.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.760]   I mean, we can talk about the cons but I was very impressed with the setup and I've been
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.240]   super impressed with the quality.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.040]   Well, let's start with the out-of-the-box experience.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   I also got mine.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.560]   I don't know when I got it but I got home on Friday from Vancouver and that's cool.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.760]   That's when I set it up in about five minutes.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.760]   Very easy.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   It comes out of the box.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.760]   It's beautiful.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   About the size of a personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.320]   And it just matters hot too apparently.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.320]   And just as expensive if you buy them from the airport.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.720]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.880]   $299 personal pan pizza.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.280]   It has HDMI out but doesn't come with any cables.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.000]   So I know cables, that's not cool.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.160]   Apple does sell a $19 HDMI cable which I bought at the same time.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.280]   I was surprised Apple's reluctance to gouge us on the cables.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.680]   You can get that same cable at Best Buy for $82 if you're looking for a good deal.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.680]   I know.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.480]   I thought they really missed a bet there.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.960]   It's a whole new Apple.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   And then it also has a component.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.200]   So if you have a TV that doesn't support HDMI, you choose HDMI if you could but if it doesn't
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.000]   you could do a component out.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.200]   And it has also a TOS link, Spittif output, digital audio output and standard analog red
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.320]   and white left and right audio output.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.320]   That's it.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.080]   Somebody told me it works with an analog, an old style TV but only in black and white.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.680]   I heard it works but it's really smashed up.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.840]   You know when you can do the change the modes on your HD and if you go to a standard from
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.520]   wide, everybody looks really skinny.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.160]   I heard it comes out really skinny.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.160]   I wouldn't mind that.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.720]   It depends, I don't have a HD set yet because I'm waiting for them to cost like what they
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.120]   should cost which is about $412.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.240]   And yeah, if your TV was made in the last year, year and a half, there's a good chance that
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.320]   it does have an HD phony mode that will automatically correct the distortion for you.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.840]   As it turns out, my Sony Wiga TV does that.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.080]   I was glad that I went on forums because I was about to say, wow, isn't that cool?
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.080]   It does it automatically.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.520]   But I found out that no was my TV said correcting or TV.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   Yes.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.960]   We got a cheapy Costco but really like very near the bottom of the line Costco and we've
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.440]   been super happy with it.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.200]   And it does one thing I love about it.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.520]   It's got three modes that I'm aware of.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.120]   We're running it, I guess whatever, a 1080i or whatever it is.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.960]   But you can do it a wide screen at standard or zoom which is great.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.680]   So if you've got something that's super wide screen like that very wide aspect ratio.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.000]   Or it's almost like doing scan and pan in a kind of fairly not obnoxious way.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.400]   Scott, you're probably the most knowledgeable video guy.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.840]   It does 1080i does 720p does 480p.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.880]   If they, I have, I have like you, I have the Pioneer.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.960]   You have the Elite but I have the 57, the Pioneer Plasma.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.040]   Is it better to run it 1080i or 720p if you had the choice?
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.720]   If you have an HDMI cable and you're running and you have a TV that supports 1080i, that's
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   the way to do.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.760]   But keep in mind, it's the content that generates the need.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:54.440]   So obviously you don't want to run a 720 signal at 1080i unless you have a really good up-converter.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.520]   And sometimes the up-converter is really suck.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.200]   Does the Apple must do some up-conversion?
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   It does.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.120]   All I tried to do, and I actually was working with a friend that bought it because I'm
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.840]   waiting for version two.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   But I hooked up her HDMI cable and I have to say it looked pretty darn good.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.600]   The first thing I actually noticed wasn't video but was audio.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.880]   I was looking for all the outs I kept saying, "Well, where do you plug in the surround
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   sound?"
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.960]   And then I realized, "Oops, you don't."
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.520]   If you got plugged in the toss link, the digital, what would you get?
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   Would you just get stereo?
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.960]   Yeah, you just get stereo.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   This device does not support surround sound.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.960]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.640]   They didn't want to license it, probably.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640]   Probably not.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.040]   Which seems to me to be kind of like, okay, who are the kind of people they're going to
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.600]   spend $299 on a toy to make their already expensive TV work?
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.320]   Well, they're going to be pretty early adopter, high tech types.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.640]   And they're going to say, "Oops, no surround sound."
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.840]   It's kind of funnily positioned because it's not super high-end but nor is it low-end.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.160]   You need at least an ED TV, really, to use it.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.000]   I'm going to bet you the knowledge to donuts it has surround sound in the next version
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.840]   or something like it.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   It's a hardware issue, though.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.280]   They couldn't do it in firmware, right?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.280]   I don't think so.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.080]   No, there's simply no output for it.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.080]   So I'm...
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.400]   I was able to overdrive it, too.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.080]   The audio very easily by turning it up.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.720]   Yeah, it doesn't really sound that good.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.400]   It looks better than it sounds.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.800]   But it's hard to tell if it's a source material.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.480]   Now, you find that podcasts were kind of quiet.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.760]   I first thought it was just mine, but then I listened to a bunch and all of the podcasts
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.240]   where I had to really crank up the volume I was setting.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.200]   I'll have to listen to a twit because we heavily compressed to it and it's all peaking
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.920]   at zero VU.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.240]   So I'll have to, because I know the levels that Twitter's recorded at, so I'll have to
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.080]   listen to that one of our podcasts and see.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.440]   Because you never know, I mean, most podcasters aren't really audio engineers.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.640]   I have to say that I watched a few things.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.760]   I watched a movie that I bought in the post 480p era.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.480]   You remember that Apple changed the resolution of iTunes video and increased it, right?
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.520]   They went to 720p from 480p.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.520]   Or is that right?
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.920]   No, it's 640, I think.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.920]   640.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   It's 640.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   It's not 720.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   Okay.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.920]   So they upgraded it.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.000]   The Royal Tenen Bombs, which I downloaded recently, so that's 640p.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.200]   It looked okay, not like a DVD.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.160]   Certainly not like an HD DVD, but I didn't see much artifacting unless I got close to
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160]   the screen.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.120]   On the other hand, some of the TV shows, even the more recent TV shows, didn't look very
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.120]   good.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.520]   You could really see the artifact and they were very smushed and smearing.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.040]   We christened it with a buying a season of Heroes, which by the way is a very good show.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.440]   And I looked, I mean, my eyes are not as careful as you guys, but I thought it was fine.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.440]   Heroes bugged me.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   Heroes bugged me.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.440]   Didn't like Heroes, huh?
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   Did you stick with it?
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   So not the show.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   I like the show.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.440]   I'm at the video.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.600]   They were quite a few artifacts, Leo, and Heroes.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.280]   I also downloaded it.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.480]   And you know, it's the kind of thing that if Alex were watching it, I could just see
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.800]   him pulling his beard out one little whisker at a time.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.920]   Yeah, I wish we had Alex on here because I'm wondering what he has he seen it?
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.400]   Because I don't know, but I've looked at stuff on Alex's TVs that came out of the 1080p
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   camera.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.840]   And I'm like, wow, that looks really good.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.120]   He's like, oh, no, no, that's crap.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   Look down here.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   Look, look, look.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.120]   Pixel down here.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   Just really bugged me.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.120]   Why does that not surprise me?
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.560]   I think if he got this thing and turned it on, he'd literally just we'd have to call
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.040]   the emergency room for him.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.160]   So in terms of let's go through the bit by bit.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.680]   So in terms of ease of setup, let's continue with ease of setup.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.880]   It plugs in very easily, starts working right away, has a little screensaver.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.240]   You don't have to worry about burn in.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.960]   Does a lot of self discovery?
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.960]   I was amazed.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   First of all, I had no problem at all.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   I've been doing that too.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.440]   I think it's the Jungian therapy.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.440]   Is that right?
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.440]   You've been part of the collective unconscious.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440]   You're the rock.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   You're the rock.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:49.200]   It had no problem at all finding my open AP and what really blew me away was at first
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.680]   I was confused.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.080]   It automatically, I don't know how it decided this, but I had at the time three iTunes
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.520]   account, Max with iTunes running, and it found the one with iTunes that was sitting right
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.680]   next to the computer, which was pretty cool.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.640]   And it went ahead and made the hook up automatically.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.440]   You have to enter, you have to pair them.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.440]   You have to enter a code.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.280]   You're kind of like doing Bluetooth where you've got to go in and say, "Here's a 5-digit
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.280]   code."
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.120]   Then you run over to the Mac and you put it on the Mac.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.120]   That's right.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   You don't have to do that once.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120]   Right.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.120]   Or when you change.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.160]   And there are two different ways you can pair an iTunes.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.240]   You have to decide ahead of time.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.600]   Is this going to be a streaming source or is this going to be a syncing source?
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.840]   One of your Macs or PCs can sync to the 40-gig hard drive.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.120]   I would imagine that you would make that, look, 40 gigs isn't a lot.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.320]   You certainly probably have a lot more content on your hard drive.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.960]   I would imagine you'd make that the one that is the slowest, at least.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.560]   Because I tell you, I have one that's way far away in the living room and it buffers
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   constantly.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.760]   And so as a result, that's the one I'm syncing on.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.480]   The thing that amazed me, I'd heard people say this and it didn't really sync until I
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.480]   did it.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.400]   It's very, very similar to plugging in and using an iPod in terms of the syncing.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.800]   Down to the fact that you can, and one thing, and again, this is something I think people
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.240]   overlook a lot with careless use of their iPods, is you can do stuff with things like
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.480]   Smart Playlists and was saying only push so many episodes.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.200]   But you can do really cool stuff.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.000]   You can say for movies, you can say include everything in this list plus the following
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   ad hoc editions.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.720]   So it's got some really smart ways that very limited amount of space.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.960]   And here's something I hadn't seen before, which is the last five purchases, the last
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.280]   five movies downloaded, which I liked.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.640]   And then TV shows not yet watched, which I liked.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.040]   Or she actually showed me the last three unplayed podcast.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   Unplayed podcast.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.320]   And this was something I was a little concerned about because I've used all five of my authorizations.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.000]   It does, just like an iPod, it does not mean to be authorized.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.560]   If the if the if the iTunes you're syncing up with is authorized, it will be able to sync.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.400]   Has it been picky with you about the movies that it would accept?
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.560]   Well, I've only played iTunes stuff and podcasts and it's worked everything that plays in iTunes
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   so far.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.760]   And we'll get to hacks a little later because there is a Divx hack, but didn't take long
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   to it.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.440]   And there were some there were some podcasts that I had a little trouble with.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.520]   I think the folks at Pixel core recently re output all of all the Mac break stuff.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.120]   Yeah, I was very first when I very first hooked it up.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.120]   It had problems.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.080]   Yeah, Alex told me that that lower third interactivity that they use, what is that called storymaker
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.080]   or whatever it is?
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.760]   I wish you were here does not.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.840]   Yeah, does not work with it.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.800]   And so that initially, yeah, Mac break didn't work, but they've made and I will also talk
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.920]   about this once we get the review out of the way.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.120]   They're making and I'm sure everybody I know you are.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.720]   Merlin will be making Apple TV versions of their shows.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   That's right.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.400]   But we'll talk about again, I'm going to try to try to keep us out in order.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.800]   So in terms of setup ease of use, Merlin.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   Thumbs up.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.880]   I think it worked great.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.920]   I mean, it's not that part of it.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.360]   I think that's the one part of it that I mean, for me, has worked.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.440]   I have had a little bit of trouble as far as the initial setup, it went pretty great.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.520]   For some reason, I don't know if this is maybe a DHCP problem or some kind of, I don't
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.240]   know what's happening, but occasionally it seems to forget that it's synced up and I'll
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.840]   try and kind of go in through the, I didn't even realize the way you described that, the
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.320]   syncing versus the streaming, but you can go in through the sources menu in your Apple
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.720]   TV and actually surf to your iTunes library.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.480]   Yeah, that's an important point, by the way, only one source at a time.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   That's right.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.200]   Again, like an iPod, if you say, I want to get divorced from this particular syncing
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.440]   source, you lose everything that's on the Apple TV.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.200]   And that's obviously copy protection.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   Right.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   Sure.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.800]   So A minus, A plus on the setup?
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.440]   I mean, from my setup, I'd give it an A minus.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.120]   I'll give it a solid A. How about you, Scott?
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.680]   Do you have an opinion on setup?
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.480]   I think it's an A. I think it's a very nice out of the box.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.600]   Part of thinking of how it could be much easier.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   How about that startup screen?
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.040]   I'm not even a big nerd for that stuff.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.720]   Oh, and let me tell you, on a 50 inch plasma, that's the highest res thing.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.800]   It's sparkles.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.760]   How about you, Andy?
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.360]   Have you had enough time to have an opinion on the setup?
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.840]   Yeah, I mean, that's still a very fresh experience.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.200]   I was using it through an airport extreme and it was, again, don't read the manual as
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.480]   if they came up the manual, but just plugging things that look like they want to be plugged
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.560]   in, turn things on, pick up the remote, and for God's sake, it's actually working.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.560]   Pretty interesting.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.600]   The only bad news I've had so far is I've got like three or four or five different base
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.200]   stations in my hardware library.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.600]   Experiment just, I decided to put just a dip a little toe in to see what hell would be visited
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.680]   upon me if I tried to use a non-Apple 8211N base station.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.880]   And it didn't like my Lynxis at all, but then again, my Lynxis didn't work with a whole
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880]   bunch of different things.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   So I don't know yet whether it's just a Lynxis problem or whether it's an Apple TV problem.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.360]   Yeah, I'm using it with an airport, the new airport extreme, it works fine.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.200]   But what, in Merlin, you're not using an airport extreme.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.400]   No, I'm not.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.800]   I, no, I'm not.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   There's, I'll go out the cat out of the bag a little bit.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.040]   Our Mac break weekly friend, John Foster is going to write a tutorial for 43 folders on
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.560]   how to run dual networks and how to run an N and G so you don't end up pulling down the
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.560]   N network.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.720]   But right now I'm just pretty much a G house right now.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   Okay.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.840]   And it works fine buffering slowdowns, anything like that?
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.200]   You've got to give it a minute.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.000]   It does buff, it does buffer.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.800]   It preloads the video.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.720]   And depending on the whole thing, your net will get started.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.680]   Well, not the whole thing, but enough so that if, if there is a hit, it will be able to
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.680]   play, but it will rebuffer.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:32.760]   We had a, we have a real troublesome Mac right at the edge of the zone and it will
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.760]   rebuffer.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.760]   In fact, it was very annoying.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.760]   My wife and son were yelling at me.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.120]   We're trying to watch the office and every, every five minutes, you know, as Steve Carell's
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.520]   face is frozen in some hideous pose while it rebuffers.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.520]   So it will do that.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.920]   And that's a two bar.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.960]   I was, that was with a two bar connection.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.840]   So you do need to have a good connection.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.320]   And that's a B, that was on a Mac mini, which is a B machine or is it G?
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.320]   It might be G.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.320]   I think it's G.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   Yeah, it's a newer Mac mini.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.320]   I don't know.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   Do I have a B machine on there?
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.320]   I think I do.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   I have one B machine.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.040]   I haven't tried it yet with B.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.960]   So I would advise you not to Leo.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.320]   Yeah, I think you're probably right.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.320]   So anyway, set up.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.080]   I think we all agree.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.480]   At least an A minus and in some cases an A.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.560]   Let's talk about performance.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.160]   We talked a little bit about how it looks.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.920]   How are people feeling about how it looks?
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.480]   Well, I mean, it's not supposed to really distract from what you're going to be looking
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.400]   at on the screen.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.560]   Just as just from like a, you know, Mac weenie aesthetic point of view, I'm kind of frustrated
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.080]   with Apple that they seem to be fascinated with gray boxes with rounded corners.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.200]   It looks just like the extreme, doesn't it?
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.960]   Yeah, I mean, it's like, remember, there was, there's a time in which, you know, part of
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.440]   the fun of going to a Steve Jobs keynote is like, I'm thinking, I bet they've got one
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.240]   that's actually looks like a brand of fruit we've never seen before.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.720]   Like a Kiwi fruit shaped iPod something.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.680]   And now it's always a rectangle with rounded corners.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   Oh, look.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.960]   And I decided made it out of aluminum this time.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.600]   I think in this case, though, you don't want it to distract.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   Exactly.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.320]   I mean, it's just going to be all you really interested in is looking at that blinking light
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   to see what it's up to.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   And that's about it.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320]   So who cares?
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.960]   Actually, I was talking about the on screen video.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   You can feel, but that's fine.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   No, no.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   Any other comments on the hardware?
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.280]   Again, back and touch aesthetic weenie.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   No, I think that's important, actually.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   I didn't really think about it.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.880]   Actually, good thing is it's neutral.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.760]   I mean, you don't want it to.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.120]   You don't want to see it really in your home theater.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.120]   Right, precisely.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.680]   But as for the interface, you know, I was really, I keep trying not to get disappointed
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.720]   with Apple's decision to more or less shut out people who still have old fashioned analog
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.520]   TVs like 480 displays.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.240]   And part of it was like, well, I bet the interface is a little bit tricky and there's
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.880]   it wouldn't really work well on this on this resolution.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.520]   And really, there's nothing that I've seen in this experience so far that really justifies
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.640]   Apple shutting out so many users.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.360]   I mean, obviously that it's you want to you want the digital experience to get the most
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.360]   out of it.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:59.320]   But the content for now is not does not really justify having an HD set.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.000]   Also how many people have are going to have an HD set in the room where they want the
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Apple TV to work?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.160]   I mean, I have three sets in my house right now.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.840]   Only one of them is HD capable and I haven't even upgraded it yet.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.360]   But the place where I want to actually use my Apple TV, believe it or not, is in my office
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.320]   with the 27 inch analog TV.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.120]   And our people are going to be wanting to install this on every single CD that excuse
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.640]   me on the on every TV that they have.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.920]   I think the answer to that is obviously no.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.120]   Well, I have two HD TVs and I'm really wishing I had two boxes because it's I have to say
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.320]   the thing that really is it's convenient.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.720]   I mean, it's so convenient.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:44.760]   From an aesthetics point of view, I figured out that if you stack the airport extreme
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:52.440]   base station and the Apple TV along with the mini, you have a white version of the Waffle
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.440]   house dealer today.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.680]   And you can cook waffles on it.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.680]   Easily.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.320]   I you know, I thought, oh, this could stack right on the extreme.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.760]   But then I thought, boy, that's asking for a real heat sandwich.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.560]   Yeah, you could just you could just cancel your PG and E account.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.400]   No kidding.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.720]   It's hot all the time.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.840]   And I guess because that's the hard drives running, I took took well over say 18 hours
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.240]   to synchronize the 40 gigs.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.600]   That's how slow the network is from that mini.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   That's where I was synchronizing it.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:25.120]   Well, the one that we hooked up Leo for some reason after the screen saver came on, we've
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.520]   found this music that my friend said she never bought and it was like, it's getting hot
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   in here.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.720]   I do think it's mostly going to be a case of people expecting that they're going to get
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.360]   their content loaded onto the Apple TV overnight as opposed to on demand where you wake up
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.360]   in the morning.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   The six hours, which nothing has been happening.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.400]   That's when all the stuff that got downloaded during the day will be transmitted over.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.840]   I wonder how many people are going to sink.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.240]   I mean, the streaming works so well.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.960]   If you've got a decent speed network, I don't know if you need to.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.920]   Yeah, but it's kind of a pain in the butt to make sure that one machine is left on all
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.920]   the day.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.920]   Oh, that's true.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.360]   Will it wake up and I'm back from sleep in order to schedule a sinker?
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.320]   Well, here's another way to think about this.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.080]   Right now, I mean, I think a lot of the discussion up till now has sort of almost wanted to say
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.240]   that the Apple TV is going to replace some component that's there now.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.400]   A lot of the discussion has been, well, how does this compare to a TV or how does this
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.040]   compare to this or that?
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.800]   And I'm already seeing myself using it for a different kind of viewing.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.920]   And maybe this is just the color of my crystal because I put out a video podcast, but I
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.440]   could see this being very much something where, yeah, you continue to watch all your regular
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.160]   TV shows on your TV or your cable box or however you like to do it.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.760]   But there's something, you know, with the sinking, there's something really cool about
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.520]   loading up a ton of content that's going to get updated regularly and just knowing that
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.960]   that can happen in the background.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.640]   That's going to happen when you're not using it.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.920]   And then just like you would with your iPod, it really is a lot like a video iPod for your
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.920]   TV.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.640]   It's just going to load up in the background.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.640]   And I don't know.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.520]   I mean, like I said, I went out and bought a season of Heroes, which is kind of weird
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.600]   because I could just get up, you know, season pass.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.480]   But I see people using this potentially really differently once they get the hang of it.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.400]   See, this really is one of those devices where I really want to look forward to one year from
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.240]   now to see exactly what role people find for it because I'm still not convinced that this
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.640]   is really going to motivate people to buy stuff off the, buy videos off the iTunes store instead
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.200]   of buying it in really the best format available, the cheapest format available, which is DVD.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:28.400]   I have a couple of terabytes worth of DVD files that I've ripped.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:34.520]   And one of the first thing I did was copy the prestige from my G5 tower onto the thing.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.960]   I also set up a couple of syncs that simply says, if there's a movie file that I haven't
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.040]   played that I've ripped in the, that I had in the past week but haven't watched yet, please
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   automatically sync this.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.360]   And I don't know how many days it's going to take to move one DVD file up there.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:54.240]   But really if an Apple TV is positioned by Apple as a device that allows you to have
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.320]   this wonderful opportunity to keep buying $10 downloads off the iTunes store, boy is
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.720]   it going to fail miserably?
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.160]   But if it's a way, if it's exactly, if it's, if it's, if it's a Trojan, I think it's a
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   Trojan horse, Andy.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.080]   I think, I think, I mean, once you, to me, now I see this as this, again, this could be
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.680]   crazy, but I really see myself watching.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.360]   I, okay, first of all, this becomes an outlet for people to be more motivated to make things
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.240]   like HD podcasts in my opinion.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   Yes, it's absolutely.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   That's the big thing.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.920]   I mean, I do local TV on a text things and the idea that I can simply, this, this is
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.440]   really motivating me to take all those DVDs that I've been burning just to archive these
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.560]   things and make a video podcast because the idea of one day later, anybody all the way
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.440]   across the, all the way across the country can watch this just by virtue of the fact that
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.960]   they have an Apple TV and they've got these things syncs.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   That's incredible.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.440]   Alex Lindsey is a jointist.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.440]   Hello, Alex.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.440]   Oh, we're sorry.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.880]   I started with that because we couldn't see it, but I'm sure you'll jump right into the
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880]   conversation here.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.800]   No, I was just going to, I was just about to say, I mean, one of the things that we're
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:57.320]   noticing and, you know, we do a lot of podcasts outside of this one and video podcasts and
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.440]   everybody wants us to deliver at 1080p, which is still a little bit higher than what the
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.880]   Apple TV will do, but, but it excites me that, you know, we're going to get to be able to
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.880]   produce a lot of stuff.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   If you do.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.360]   You're actually going to see a high quality video.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.080]   If you do it 1080p, will it play on the Apple TV?
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   It won't.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.520]   The 1080i, I think, is the highest, I believe that, and we're just starting to really dig
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   into the town.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:25.160]   Merlin, who's producing it with you at Pixelcore, is already doing a Apple TV version, specific
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.320]   version of his show, The Merlin Show.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   Right.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.000]   And it's kind of our, it's, it's sort of like a wide screen 640.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.840]   So it's 854 by 480, but I was, I got to tell you, I had a real white knuckle moment bringing
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.240]   that up thinking, gosh, hey, I hope this runs and be if it does run, I hope it looks
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.280]   good and I was really surprised.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.760]   You should look as good, if not better, than anything else on there.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.920]   I mean, I think you're probably going to look better than the stuff iTunes is selling.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.000]   Well, next month, we're finally, we're getting the cameras.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.560]   Actually, it's this, again, this might be a little bit inside baseball, but something
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.200]   that Alex and I have been talking about, the cameras that we're getting, the camera that
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   I'm getting next month, and I think some, I think some cameras that you guys are getting,
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.960]   has an HDMI out that you might want to talk about this, Alex.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.920]   But now you can, for like, for a surprisingly small amount of money, for just about a grand,
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.920]   you can get a camera that goes HDMI straight into a computer.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.560]   How much do we spend in those XL2s, Alex?
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   Tell me again.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.560]   You don't want to.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.240]   You showed me an example of that though, Alex, that was pretty mind-blowing.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.000]   Yeah, and the big thing is, is that it's going to be really exciting for a lot of people
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   producing.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.880]   Now, they don't have, just to make you feel better, Leo, they don't have the same lenses
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   on the front.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.280]   It's much easier to do a lot of this stuff, but at the same time, you're seeing these
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.320]   little, very inexpensive cameras.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.320]   The HDMI basically is coming out of most of these cameras uncompressed.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.520]   So it's still what we would call 422, which is a little technical, but it means that the
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.960]   color is a little bit less than the black and white information.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   But it's as good as TV.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.600]   I mean, that's what TV cameras are doing generally, they're 422.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.200]   And it is not being compressed down to HDV or DV, whatever is right.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   That's the key, right?
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   It's very compressed.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   So it's not going to have a lot of the little blocking.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.680]   Now, it's going to have blocking by the time you actually end up on iTunes, because you're
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.720]   going to use H.264 or whatever.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.920]   But there is a difference, you know, there really is a big difference between what you
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.560]   can do in production and how much quality control you can have when you have really
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.400]   a much higher red signal.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.520]   It's like shooting in RAW, don't you?
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.520]   You got more room to move in either direction.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.480]   And one of the things about this is that it is going to provide the actual user, people
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.040]   who are listening to this show.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:34.120]   What you have, of course, the tools to really do very, very high quality work, readily available
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.440]   at the same time that you have the ability to distribute it, which is those things really
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.640]   haven't been there altogether before.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.680]   So, it's very exciting.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.760]   I mean, that's one of the keys about this is that podcasts is on the menu right there
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.640]   with movies, TV shows, music and photos.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.640]   You're at a, you're a peer with those things.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.480]   This is, did you all see this as a real opportunity for video podcasters to suddenly play with
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.480]   big guys?
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.480]   There's absolutely, in my opinion, Daniel Aaron wrote a wonderful thing.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.000]   Actually, I did actually, I did actually a post yesterday on 43 folders.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.760]   I linked to a couple of really good stories about the problem of everybody now.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.760]   Okay, great.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.760]   Now, I've got an HDTV.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.760]   I've got an Apple TV.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.400]   Give me some HD content and Apple, you know, iTunes is not going to be pushing out any
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.120]   four gigabyte movies anytime soon.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.400]   And so it's weird in this weird way.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.080]   It gives a competitive advantage to somebody who's pushing out a five minute HD, you know,
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.080]   720p podcast.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.640]   As you say, Leo, you're going to look better than the stuff that people are buying on the
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.640]   iTunes store.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   That's really interesting.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.120]   Now we just have to get the content up and, of course, I guess for our audience, the
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.440]   content's there, but I'm just saying it's an opportunity for somebody to do something
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.120]   that really could be, you know, now you were talking about how you buy your, how you use
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   it, Merlin.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.360]   I use it as my primary TV input is iTunes.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.560]   I don't, I don't watch TV from the cable.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.800]   I download, I buy stuff and download stuff and rip stuff.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.000]   So it's, it's my primary, it's my Tivo.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.280]   And so far I'm, this is the thing I've been waiting for, frankly.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.760]   I had a rip of wood stock that I made for my video iPod and it looked, it looks fine,
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.600]   even though it's super wide screen.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   It's pretty watchable.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.240]   I watched the, as I said, the Royal Ten of Bombs yesterday on it, the whole movie and
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   it was great.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.640]   I mean, here's where it gets interesting though, as we talked about this a little bit on, on
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.160]   Twit, but the part where it gets really interesting is, okay, so if you're like me, you flip
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:26.560]   it on, you watch BattleStargolactica rerun in HD on, you know, on universal, you know,
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   off the Tivo.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.360]   And then I flip on, you know, a high resolution podcast.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.320]   I watch one of my high resolution podcasts.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.760]   And then you bring up something that's just on kind of standard sort of iPod size video.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.440]   Yeah, you don't want to watch it.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.320]   It's, here's the funny part, everybody keeps saying to me, well, who wants to watch a couple
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.880]   hipsters with bad haircuts talk to each other on NHD?
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.680]   Well, maybe nobody, but I think that bar is going to get raised with a Apple TV.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.920]   People are going to come to expect a higher level of quality no matter what the content
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.920]   is.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.520]   Nobody's, it's going to be right now, if you watch an iPod video on Apple TV iPod size
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.440]   video, it's a little bit like watching full screen YouTube.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.040]   Now here's, now here's an interesting idea.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.640]   Do you think that this will give sort of an interesting advantage to the networks and
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.200]   the real commercial producers?
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.120]   Because you really can't afford to serve gigabytes and gigabytes of gigabytes of high
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.520]   D HD video if you're just two guys with bad haircuts and a dorm room is going to have
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.400]   to go to people who for some reason are making money off of their podcasts or networks who
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.280]   are smart enough to say, well, if people aren't tuning in at 6 30 in the evening, why don't
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.760]   we just burn an HD podcast of this podcast of this newscast that people can see it overnight?
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.440]   That's where Libson makes this disruptive.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.760]   As long as Libson can stay in business, that's a non issue.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   As long as there's on meter bandwidth vendors, it's not an issue.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.800]   Good point though, it is not just an opportunity for podcasters, an opportunity for everybody,
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.160]   including mainstream media, if they see it.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.520]   It'd be crazy to overlook this opportunity.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.960]   I'd love to pay a little bit on my pay a little bit more, but I'd love to be able to
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.480]   download 24, for instance, at HD quality rather than, you know, well, that's what I
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   want.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.480]   I wonder if Apple is going to start to give you higher quality now.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   I mean, it's not enough.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.640]   I hate to interrupt, but I just want to know where you guys talking about the Canon camera
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640]   that's going to happen to me.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   Yeah, HD-20.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.360]   Yeah, I think we're going to buy four of those.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.880]   That has HDMI out.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.880]   It's incredible.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.560]   It's potentially disruptive camera in terms of the cost and what it's called.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.840]   Here's the thing is that it's truly a 1920 by 1080 chip that's sitting inside of that
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   little camera.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.560]   Oh, so you're getting 1080p?
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.560]   It'll do 1080p.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.760]   It does some kind of, you know, it's still doing some kind of, that's what the chip is
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.240]   able to do, but it is really able to shoot 1080p going out of that HDMI.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.760]   Now I think that how it's doing it, and we don't want to get too much into this, but
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.360]   it's kind of doubling up the interlacing, which is fine.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.360]   That's the way everybody does it.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.120]   It's kind of a segmented frame is what it's called.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.720]   So the, and we have to test it.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.160]   Merlin's been willing to be the guinea pig, but as soon as he tests it, if it does 50%
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.560]   of what I think it's going to do.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.120]   Yeah, we're going to do this thing like they did in clockwork, or entry, you have like
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.680]   have his eyelids pried open and make him watch it, or is he just going to volunteer
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.680]   to watch it?
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.680]   I just don't mention it.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.080]   Now April 6th, I've been, my order's in.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   I can't wait.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   That's exciting.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   That's really nice.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.560]   But strikes me that there's not only disruption here, but this intermediation going on.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.720]   I mean, this does give consumers choice.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.200]   And you know, the whole model of broadcast television and radio for years and years
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.960]   and years, decades has been, we now interrupt you with this program.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.560]   And you no longer have to be interrupting.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.560]   No ads.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.440]   I haven't seen any ads in years, frankly, on my TV set.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.360]   Whether it's skipping through Tivo or just not downloading them without ads.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.240]   Let's not forget, by the way, it does also play the music that's on your computer.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.920]   And while the audio on the video didn't sound so good, the music sounded fine to me.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.760]   I have a stereo, you know, a good stereo hooked up to the TV.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.760]   You do get your photos.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.040]   And if you, it has a screen saver that'll do a nice little slideshow with your photos.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.920]   If you sync your photos over, I don't think it does the photos streaming.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.880]   So it's really a complete entertainment system.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.120]   You think that that's important or is it really all about the video?
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.440]   I don't think it's important for us, per speakers, yeah.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.960]   I think the video is definitely the most important part.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:11.080]   And I think it is the Apple's rough TV after all, not the Apple home entertainment unit.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.800]   But for Leo, from your point of view, you've made such a good case for the fact that we
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.240]   need to start talking about audio podcasts or netcasts or whatever in terms of not just
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.520]   being this thing that you listen to on an iPod.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.680]   And for me, that means now I can pull in sound of young America and listen to it and listen
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.040]   to it in my living room.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.040]   That's right.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.440]   Just like I would this American life and whenever I want.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.760]   And you may actually end up doing that now that it's easy.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   I'm curious.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.760]   It's all in the background.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   You know, that's the thing.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.240]   This is the part that I think people, again, you kind of got to get your head around this.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.560]   But you're used to your iPod being ready for your commute in the morning and it pulls
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.560]   down your podcast.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.800]   But potentially you throw tons of feeds at this thing and it becomes like, well, it
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.880]   becomes a little bit like subscriptions on the T though stuff just loads up.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.400]   And when you're ready, you go and watch it.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.920]   And then when that goes away, more stuff gets pushed in.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.440]   Yeah, it actually becomes a new form of channel surfing where instead of channel surfing against
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.240]   200 channels for the crap, you're now channel surfing against about 20 hours worth of stuff
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.120]   that you don't have time to listen to or watch.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.960]   But at least it's the stuff that you wanted to watch.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   Exactly.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.360]   But now you don't even have to be quite so selective.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.960]   I can afford to be selective when I'm on my iPod, but I still have that same experience
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.640]   of, gee, I don't know what I want to listen to.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.200]   I just know I want to listen to something without anticipating that I want to listen to the
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.800]   Pendulette show where I want to listen to fresh air.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:36.160]   I do think the ability for podcasters to get a little bit more attention as a result of
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:42.080]   having podcasts right there on the menu is a big thing related to the whole Apple TV genre.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.600]   And whether or not the Apple TV as we see it now or some version down the road becomes
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   a big deal, the thing I'm most excited about is this gives us a chance to start that dialogue.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.800]   Because how many times have we all responded to the question, what's a podcast?
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.960]   Excuse me, this will naturally cause people to ask that question.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.080]   And that's kind of a good thing because we can say, well, let us show you.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.320]   But I think anybody who buys this knows because they're using iTunes, they're probably Mac
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   people.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.800]   I mean, it's not going to open eyes in the Windows world particularly, is it?
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.720]   Well, yeah, I thought it was, yeah, it is kind of an odd topic, isn't it?
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.080]   But all you got to do, especially when you have a free piece of software that you can
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.640]   stack right next door to Windows Media Player and simply say, well, this has an Apple logo,
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.680]   this software does not have an Apple logo on it.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.680]   See which one you like better.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.480]   And one missing piece, I don't know how they would pull this off.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.720]   Oh, yeah, actually one thing that's kind of cool we didn't mention.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.640]   You get stuff like movie trailers on there.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.560]   It's already, it's a good calling down movie trailers.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.880]   I think one thing that might be useful, this is kind of a 37 signal sort of approach.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.080]   But I think when people click on podcasts for the first time, they shouldn't get a big
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.320]   yellow warning that says there are no podcasts here.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.480]   It would be great if there was some way that it either could become preloaded with some
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:54.800]   unobjectionable podcasts or it could have you give you some kind of a link that would,
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.040]   I don't know, get populated back into iTunes in such a way that, oh, well, here's stuff
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.720]   that you might enjoy that we can pull down as a sample.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.880]   Well, that's the first thing people notice that you can't actually download stuff directly
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.880]   onto the disk.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.440]   And I imagine that's a capability that will be added.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.760]   Although it adds this whole issue of rights.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.280]   Right now you have to worry about rights management because you've already got the rights management
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.960]   handled by a computer somewhere else.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.160]   And that's why I don't think they'll be adding that we are.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.120]   I don't think they want to get into that stream.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   Right.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.840]   Well, a lot of people are doing a lot of hacking before it was out for one day.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:32.960]   The disk image was out and apparently it's pretty much OS 10, a pretty normal OS 10.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:40.200]   iPod hacks has actually came from Mac rumors via a forum post at something awful.com.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:45.520]   The instructions for adding Perion to it so that you can play back XVID and Divx movies.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.160]   You do have to open it up, pull the drive, mount the file system, install Perion and
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.360]   drop bear or enable SSH.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.200]   And then it doesn't really sink properly, right?
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   That's a good question.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.200]   How would you get the files over there?
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   I don't know.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.880]   I don't have a little bootstrap thing that happens with this movie that runs.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.120]   I don't completely understand.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:09.800]   I don't think it's as automatic as it is with an MUN before.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.920]   This description doesn't at any point say how to get other movies into it.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.920]   Maybe they're--
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.560]   I just pull the drive every time.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.600]   Well, that's probably-- I would imagine why that's why they put SSH on there so you can
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.640]   log in and cop and use--
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.720]   You pointed out some interesting though, which is I mean the first day this came out.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.840]   I don't know if it was make or one of the maybe might have been ultimate up a web block.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.480]   You basically tear the bottom off this thing, take out four screws and you got access to
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   your drive and you can go in there and--
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.280]   That's amazing how hackable it is.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.520]   Pentium M in there is the processor.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.160]   It is running as we said, kind of an OS 10.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:48.000]   People are talking about booting it from a USB drive.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.120]   I'm looking at-- there's already an Apple TV hacks.net website.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.520]   That was going to be my-- that was going to be my pick lead.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.520]   Was it?
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   I'm not talking anymore about it.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.840]   There's a hard drive upgrade.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.200]   People got it up to 120 gigabytes.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.720]   Although again, because it streams so well, I don't know the size of the hard drives,
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   all that important.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.520]   Yeah, but anyone--
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.720]   Someone's got a desktop working on it.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.960]   Somebody's got a patchy working on it.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.280]   I mean, it's pretty amazing.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.640]   Why is it that people want to work so hard to avoid listening to podcasts and watching
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.560]   TV shows on this thing?
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.560]   You have to-- they haven't had enough time to get that board with it.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.000]   They want to do more, more.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.600]   Well, you know what the real interest is, of course, is getting BitTorrent running on
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.120]   it somehow and interfacing with it.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.120]   That's what you want.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.960]   Yeah, I want people-- I want police officers clad in black with all kinds of weapons swinging
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.920]   into my windows every hour of the day or night.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.320]   That's what happens the first moment that someone gets BitTorrent working on Apple TV
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.720]   because the MPAA and the TV industry will not allow this to happen.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.960]   That's when Skynet becomes self-aware when you can hook a BitTorrent directly to your
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.960]   TV set.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.960]   It's a little singularity.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.960]   Then we've got a problem.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.680]   And it just burns an image of Jack Valenti on your set.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   I think it'll fall.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.680]   And that's what you want.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.740]   You want BitTorrent, you want to be able to download any movie you want, play it back
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:10.440]   through the Apple TV, and then you've got a device, right?
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.880]   I think they're writing something into the new Patriot Act that makes that illegal.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.880]   That and baba ganush.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.680]   Well, I mean, and you're really close with the democracy player of being able to do that,
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.080]   you know, get almost to that.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.720]   If democracy player was able to--
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.240]   Well, and that's what Zudio is trying to do, right, with the new Azurias, isn't it?
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.240]   It's about BitTorrent.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:35.520]   Although I know there's no proprietary quote proprietary content on there.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.640]   But yeah, they're all moving that direction.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.240]   Of course, what everyone wants to do is get on there.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.080]   And I think that there's Apple or somebody's really going to have to solve some kind of
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.840]   peer-to-peer process just because that's what really opens this thing up.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   It does become an expense issue if you start putting out 720p.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:55.800]   I mean, Libson can take us to a certain level, but for everyone to be doing it, I think that
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.160]   it's going to be a heavy bandwidth cost if you're very popular.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.400]   And there's also the problem.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:05.120]   I mean, if you're like me and you're sinking in a consideration, again, if we take it as
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   red that an HD movie, for example, would be 4GB.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:13.240]   For me, that's 4GB on my-- that's over 10% of the available space on my Apple TV, but
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.400]   it's also 4GB that's got to be sitting on my drive.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.400]   And that starts to add up.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.280]   Well, you have a 120 gig drive.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.280]   That's 30 months.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.280]   Well, how are you?
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.280]   So how much excess space-- we've had this conversation.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.280]   Oh, no, that's a good question.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.920]   I mean, for me, I'm always having to throw stuff out on my iTunes library.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.560]   iTunes and iFoD are the sort of constant source of bloat for me.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.160]   I have a whole separate drive hook to an old laptop.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.000]   By the way, you cannot do the Apple TV.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.760]   There's no-- I mean, there's USB, but you can't put an external drive on.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.760]   Service USB, yeah.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.520]   You know, that's still kind of an item of annoyance with me, with Apple TV, with iTunes,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520]   with the iPod.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.640]   The fact that you have to install everything through a managed library, that especially
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.840]   when you have far, far more music and videos than you have capacity for on your local device,
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:05.360]   I guess got so fed up with having to-- every time I rip a new DVD that I bought and I want
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.280]   to travel with it on my iPod, I just don't want to have that 1.2 gigabyte file on my
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.480]   hard drive while I'm sinking it over.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.360]   And now I've just thrown my hands up in the air and decided, well, you know what?
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.960]   I've got the Sony PSP.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.000]   This is my new dedicated video player because I can just drag a file onto a memory card
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.240]   and I'm done.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.520]   Should we talk about stuff that sucks?
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.520]   All right.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.520]   What's wrong with Apple TV?
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.920]   Some of it feels a little bit 1.0, for sure.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.840]   I mean, I think that-- I like the fact that I can get my music pushed out to there.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.640]   I've got a whole bunch of airport expresses that I usually stream to for day-to-day stuff,
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.240]   but I kind of like the fact that you can push music.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.840]   The screen saver while music is playing is very ADD.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.800]   It just-- it keeps jumping around and changing and flipping and going into these different
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.800]   modes.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   That's to protect your plasma screen, though.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   I mean, that's--
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   That's the point.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.760]   You can afford a plasma screen on Apple TV you deserve to have burn in.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.200]   Buy another one next to your-- give the old one to your snotty 16-year-old trust fund,
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   kids.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.920]   Scott, why are you not buying an Apple TV?
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.800]   Well, I mean, I kind of like what Andy was saying earlier.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.760]   I mean, first of all, I've got like, Staley R, cable HD, DVRs.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.960]   I've got DVDs that are, you know, pumping stuff out.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.960]   I've got Blu-ray.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.400]   I've got all this stuff.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:27.040]   I just don't see any reason to take a step back and get a lower quality product.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.760]   And also because I'm more interested in this as a concept right now than I am a product.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.480]   I think it'll be a big deal someday.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:39.120]   So for me, I would-- you know, I would have to undo my system to put this thing in.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.960]   I just don't see myself taking advantage of it.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:46.880]   I might get one to throw on a plasma screen that I, you know, get a little Panasonic 42-inch
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.520]   plasma screen for my bedroom or something.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.320]   That's your little like extra TV as a little into each plasma?
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.360]   Well, he spends a lot of time at the bedroom.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.360]   You know what I mean.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.120]   It's like your second TV poops out my TV, man.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.520]   Oh, look, I made another Costco TV.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:10.360]   I got to say that one of the reasons that I probably won't consider buying the 1.0 is
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.720]   I'm pretty attuned to sound.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:18.760]   And I like-- I mean, I have a very nice, you know, sound system, surround sound.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.520]   I have Dolby 7.1.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.760]   I've got all the speakers.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.280]   I've spent quite a lot of money on it.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.120]   And not being able to get surround sound out of this is kind of a deal breaker for me.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.520]   Now, the other-- go ahead, Andy.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.440]   I just want to ask you-- ask you.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.440]   What kind of a setup do you have inside your house?
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.440]   Is the room tuned for surround sound?
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:43.480]   Because I find that I do-- I have an old-- actually, an ancient Dolby 5.1 setup.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.640]   And I find myself really not even activating the rear speakers because I just don't have
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.440]   a room where it's such a worthy, wonderful, immersive experience.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.640]   Do you really tell the difference between 7.1 and every other configuration?
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.280]   In my particular room, Andy, the answer is yes.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.280]   Plus, I spent the money to have a broken out.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.920]   $1,000 audio setup.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.360]   I had a pro come out and specifically tune where the speakers go.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.360]   Sherman or--
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.360]   --and he--
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.360]   --so I heard a joke.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.920]   Couldn't afford a Canadian.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.440]   Well, that's all right.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.600]   Oh, the Germans are the best so they come.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   Still twinning sounds.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.240]   They know how to take sound and make it sing.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   Actually, that's when I got my high-end clip system, Leo.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:31.280]   But since then, I've purchased the Ultimate High-end Monitor Audio Platinum Series speakers,
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.080]   which I had a British engineer install for.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   Yeah, well, you're now.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   That's a joke.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   I said, "No."
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   But I will say, Andy, you're right.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.120]   There are rooms where surround sound doesn't work.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.520]   I'm lucky that I have a room that's perfect for that.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.800]   And I can hear the difference.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:47.120]   But even if I-- even if I couldn't hear the difference between 5.1 and 7.1, guess what?
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.040]   Apple TV doesn't even give you 5.1.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   Right.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.840]   I used to make fun of those people who would be like, "Oh, you're not going to be the difference.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.920]   Once you start watching HD, you can't watch normal TV again."
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   Oh, it's true.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.920]   You're such a loser.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.440]   Why don't you just get over it?
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.080]   You're like your Howie Mandel game show needs to be in HD.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.880]   And the funny part is literally like two hours into HD.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   I was like, "Ahh!"
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   And you get this image.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.280]   This is the mystery of life I have.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.280]   Oh, wow.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.280]   It's hard.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.720]   When you see it, you do kind of notice the difference.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.200]   Well, one thing I want to say is that one thing I was going to say that I think is exciting
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.920]   is once again, this is a huge advantage for podcasters right now because they are able
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:32.200]   to literally produce content that, I mean, you got to, if it's good content, the visual
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:37.200]   quality could be higher than what people are getting on HD cable because that is being
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   heavily compressed.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   Right.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.600]   And if you compress it just a little bit less and because we're not trying to do 40-minute
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.000]   shows, we might be doing three to seven-minute video shows.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.680]   If we're doing those short shows, we can afford to make them a little bit bigger.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:53.120]   We can afford to make them a little bit cleaner and they'll actually be better than the cable
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.960]   experience someone gets with HD.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.320]   And we can do that right now with Apple TV.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   Do you think that Apple is sort of sending a message by not putting in like a 100-gig
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.480]   hard drive or even making that as an option?
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.280]   The fact that it's giving it a 40-gig hard drive, which is enough for an ambitious amount
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.320]   of music and ambitious number of podcasts and ambitious number of low-resolution video,
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.080]   but it's just not an HD, studly hard drive.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.000]   You need at least 100 gigs to do anything.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   And you're streaming.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.920]   But the fact that that's really the message is that people, I'm not even sure why they
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.120]   built the sync in.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.000]   It streams so well except that they're, I guess, if you have a computer that just doesn't connect
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   well.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.520]   Well, so also realize that computer costs money to run.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.000]   I mean, I really don't want to keep a hundred, forty-hundred-two-hundred-watt machine on
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.040]   24 hours for that sort of thing.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.080]   By the way, I just want to point out, because somebody will point out in the comments if
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:45.000]   I don't, that the Xbox 360 has done almost all of this since it came out.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.400]   And I'm probably, I'm willing to bet the only one of you that actually has an Xbox 360 hooked
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.920]   up to the same monitor in the same setting.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.040]   I've been buying shows on the Xbox Live marketplace playing them back.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.400]   I think they look marginally better.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.920]   Not a lot better, but marginally better.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:10.000]   You can get real high-def 720p movies and some high-def TV shows on Xbox Live, which
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   you can't get.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.520]   You can only get SD quality on the iTunes store.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:22.320]   You know, I have to say that Xbox 360 is just not as elegant as Slicker is easy to use.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.200]   It has some technical advantages, like many Microsoft products, but the ease of use isn't
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   there.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.240]   And by the way, the Apple TV is silent.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.200]   The Xbox 360 winds like a little power mower in my best.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   Sounds like a jet engine.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.680]   Yeah, it's really noisy.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.960]   Plus, how much does it cost to outfit an Xbox 360 with the same sort of features that
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.800]   has an Apple TV?
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   $399.
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.880]   Does that include the hard drive?
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.320]   It comes with a hard drive.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.800]   And it's a 20 gig hard drive.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.000]   And it connects directly to the internet, right?
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.080]   Well, the other thing is you can buy stuff on the Xbox 360 absolutely.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.520]   Does it cost money to be part of the Xbox marketplace?
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.360]   Yeah, but not...
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.040]   You have to buy a certain amount of credit, but it's not.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.320]   No, it's not a monthly subscription.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.400]   You just have to buy a certain amount of credit.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   Okay.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.680]   I'm sorry, there is a subscription.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.920]   But it's a fairly low subscription monthly, a yearly subscription.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   I don't remember.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   Tell the truth.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   I have a feeling there's...
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.680]   This is a go back, just for a sec, but I have a feeling there's a couple of reasons
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.840]   that Apple is taking this approach.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.840]   I mean, one is, first of all, you don't want somebody to hook this thing up and then realize
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.720]   they've got to wait three hours to see something.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.800]   And just in terms of the user experience, I could see them very much saying, well, you
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.720]   know what, let's start out with stuff that's not going to be too crazy.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.680]   Even if you download an episode of Lost, it's not going to put you out of business in terms
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.680]   of downloading.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.640]   It's going to be the second with only 40 gigs on there.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.080]   And again, for most people who are thinking like me, that's also going to be 40 gigs on
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.160]   your drive if you're not streaming.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:52.480]   So if you have somebody go out and download what will fit, what, eight HD movies, what
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.760]   else are you going to buy?
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.360]   Can they charge that much more to be worthwhile to fill up your drive that fast?
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.200]   No, they can't.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200]   They can't.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.520]   There's the answer, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.360]   Just to clarify, the Xbox Live three month membership premium gold pack that includes
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.880]   some minutes to buy stuff is 30 bucks and for a year, it's 60 bucks.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.040]   So unlike iTunes, you do have to pay a subscription fee.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.600]   And I think that bucks be little.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.560]   I just want the idea of paying money for the privilege of being able to pay more money.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   Just paying more money.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.560]   Well, you're getting other stuff online gaming and things.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.880]   I mean, it's, you know, it's that was you.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.680]   That was the origin of the product value added.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:40.040]   I have the Xbox 360 and I have the PlayStation three and I have PlayStation three, by the
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.520]   way, I have to say I have finally played with one.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.360]   It looks good.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.560]   It looks really good on a 50 inch plasma resistance fall of man is stunning.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.920]   I just played that game today.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:55.080]   I was a little, I was poo-pooing the PlayStation three and Paul Therat talked me into looking
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:59.960]   at it and I have to say if it weren't 700 bucks, I'd have one of my as well.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   Why?
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.360]   And I think that one thing between all of these that it's exciting both for producers and
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:09.560]   for consumers of content is that all three of these platforms are going to be competing
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.480]   heavily with each other.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.480]   Right.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.760]   You know, to get to fill that up.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.360]   You know, so as a producer, it's really exciting because they're all, they all want content.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.240]   And as a consumer, it's going to be great because you're just going to see a big push,
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   you know, in this area.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.920]   This is going to be, I think, a really, really heavy growth area.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.640]   And I think that whether even though Sony and Microsoft have been doing it, I think Apple's
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.000]   entry is going to benefit both, is going to benefit them as well.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.440]   It's just going to add a lot more excitement to the process.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   Let's wrap it up.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.400]   Any final thoughts before we go to our picks of the week?
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.080]   You can use your picks from last week, by the way.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.360]   Reuse last week's picks.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.560]   Well I think it's an exciting turn of events.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.960]   I think it's going to start an important conversation.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:56.360]   I think it's going to allow podcasters new opportunities.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.800]   I just think that for me personally, it's not something to get crazy about just yet.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.680]   It ain't no iPhone.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   It ain't no iPhone.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:09.240]   Now I'll tell you this, as soon as we see an iPhone half to the Apple TV, I will then
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   buy one.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.320]   I have, I actually have a prediction.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.840]   And you know, I don't like to do the predictions.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.840]   I don't know if it's a prediction so much.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.840]   Oh, here we go.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:16.840]   Oh, you ready?
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.840]   Ready?
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.840]   We're ready.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.920]   It's, there's going to be a Beatles yellow submarine Apple TV.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.680]   I still understand why that didn't happen.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.640]   No, that really should have happened.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.600]   Oh, you know, this came up a little bit on, this came up a little bit on Twit.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.760]   But I think the interesting thing here, we're talking a little bit about what the
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.920]   guys from the Tiki Bar show about, you know, a competition and all this kind of blah,
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.120]   blah, blah, blah, but I know we're competing with each other and blah, blah, blah.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.800]   I think the really interesting thing to watch at this point is going to be the really big
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:48.960]   players for whom an investment in this kind of content is trivial to see them coming in
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.200]   much more and much more of a way than, for example, right now you see things like the
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.200]   Lost Podcast or the Family Guy Podcast.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:59.080]   I think it's going to be really interesting to see them potentially see big, big producers
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:03.640]   making kind of little bits of micro content that are tailored for the Apple TV.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.600]   That's, I really think that's going to happen in the next three months.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.960]   Really screw micro content.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.680]   I really think that a year from now, this isn't a prediction, but I'm really more interested
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:18.320]   in seeing what happens when the big guys, not the mom and pop producers, start to get
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.320]   into this.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:24.320]   If they suddenly realize, if Apple manages to get a really significant number of households
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:30.040]   with Apple TVs, this really changes the way that, again, newscasts can be broadcast,
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.520]   the way that bonus features on tonight's episode of the Office can be broadcast.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:38.680]   Right now, CBS is trying to be as aggressive as possible as to indicate that, well, this
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:42.800]   episode of the Amazing Race logs in at 44 minutes, but we also have eight more minutes
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.560]   worth of content that's waiting for you on CBS.com, which a lot of people aren't going
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.080]   to simplify virtue of the fact that they, a lot of people just aren't in the habit of
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.920]   watching TV through a, through a computer screen.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.920]   But if that's a seamless transition between picking up, putting down one remote and picking
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.480]   up another remote and watching the same content on a different screen, that really could change
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.000]   the way entertainment is delivered over the next two years.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.920]   Well, also, I think that if you add interactivity to the ones that you're buying from iTunes,
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:16.200]   if I'm able to be sitting there with watching, for instance, Lost or 24 on, that I bought
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.480]   through iTunes.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.960]   And I get to the end and I could click on something, you know, in the, in the, to just immediately
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.560]   download the other stuff, then we're able to start branching into more and more content.
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.720]   You know, I think those are other things that then you're not even going back and forth.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:33.120]   You're once again, having your experience with the Apple TV completely.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.440]   That's interesting.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.920]   I really do think that interactive TV is a lot like what interactive movies were like
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.400]   10 years ago, where the technology is known as been that brilliant yet to really figure
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.480]   out how to make it work.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:49.520]   You can put features in that you think people want, but then people will leave it alone.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.840]   It wasn't until interactive gaming came along.
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:54.560]   We realized that, oh, wait, that's what an interactive movie is.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.520]   It's, it's, it's Vice City.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.280]   It's not, it's not a movie that stops at a certain point where you ask the audience if
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.520]   they want to, if the guy to turn left or go down the alley.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.520]   I'm not sure.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:07.960]   I was just, I was just saying that I'm really not, I'm not sure if if anybody alive today
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.640]   will really get the idea of interactive TV.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.840]   I don't think that, I don't think that it really works for narrative content.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:18.280]   I think it's kind of a, it's in me, in my opinion, for the most part, it's a bit of a
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:23.160]   waste of time for stuff like loss or 24, except at the end to tell you you could go watch
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.000]   a bunch of extras.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.320]   But I do think that for non-fictional stuff, for instance, you know, if I'm watching something
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.840]   that, you know, I'm watching something about camping, you know, I want to see more about
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:36.120]   how to use that hammer, you know, I can get more information and I think people could grow
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.760]   into that pretty quickly.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.600]   Well, I have the interactive lower thirds that we were doing with that.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.600]   That we use with Macbreak.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.600]   Exactly.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:45.600]   I broke that whole thing.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.640]   Once again, Alex is too far ahead of his time.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.960]   I do got to take that back.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.280]   Once you mentioned the lost, I've suddenly realized the reason why I don't watch lost
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.960]   is that I'm constantly wondering, well, what's the deal with that guy?
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.960]   Oh, wow, those people.
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   You can't switch it right.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   You want us to click on it.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:00.960]   It's a good loss.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.960]   There was a hyperlink saying what the hell the deal is with that guy.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.960]   Click.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   That is a baby start.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.840]   That would be really, if you really think about it, you know, you could, there's all kinds
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.480]   of ways to hack that up specifically with something like lost where you could, I want
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.400]   to see the last three segments that had him in it, the last two or three minute pieces
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.240]   so I can catch back up to, you know, why we're here, you know, you know, that would be kind
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.240]   of interesting.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.240]   In a pie in the sky sort of way.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:32.960]   You know, at J Edelson at South by Southwest, he's, of course, the CEO of revision three
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:36.760]   that does dignity and pixel perfect and all those other shows, which I think a number
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:43.000]   of them you produce, Alex, said that this is absolute, he predicted Apple TV would absolutely
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   change everything.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.040]   It's the beginning of true IPTV.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:50.560]   Of course, he has some interest in it being that way since he runs a network of IPTV
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.760]   shows.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.360]   So we all agree.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:58.040]   It's, I think, pretty important and I know I'll be watching my Apple TV tonight, even
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.920]   though my wife and son will yell at me when Steve Carell freezes again.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.960]   Time for our picks and Annie, we jumped you.
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.600]   You weren't even planning to be on this show.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.040]   We just kind of corralled you.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.680]   So I'm not going to make you have a pick unless you've got something that you've been looking
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.680]   at.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.880]   That's cool because I haven't been doing the show for a year.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:20.800]   So essentially I've got eight or nine months worth of stuff that I haven't talked about.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.480]   So yes, about one third into the show when you first mentioned the pick of the week,
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.920]   I had my little panic attacks.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:28.280]   Holy, holy crap.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.480]   Let's go to the dock and see something that we haven't talked about yet.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:36.640]   But actually one of the most important applications I'm almost apologetic to say is a little app
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   called ComicTastic.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:45.000]   This is an HTML scraper based internet app that does nothing but download comic strips
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   for you.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.280]   It is like if everyone who does an online available comic strip were smart enough to have an RSS
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.440]   feed or to podcast it, this would be the iTunes for that sort of thing.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:01.840]   Where all you have to do, you can find it at spiny.com, just like spinynormon.com.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.960]   And of course, exactly.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.200]   So all I have to do is give it the URL of either, if it's an online strip, just give
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.520]   it the RSS feed.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:12.680]   If you're at United Feature Syndicate or a newspaper like Boston Globes Comics page,
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.800]   all you have to do is give it the URL for the page and it will do nine times out of ten.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.560]   It'll do a really good job of figuring out which image on this page is the right one.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.360]   And then you simply say, please, at six a.m. every single morning, please download all
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.520]   my comic strips.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.600]   And so now every morning I get 40, 50, 60 comic strips from all over the country.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:34.760]   I remember as a kid, I would have to sneak a peek at my neighbor's Boston Herald because
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:39.720]   my parents subscribed to the Boston Globe because the Herald has Snoopy and Charlie Brown and
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:40.720]   the Globe did not.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.200]   Now, essentially every strip I'm interested in, whether it's old media or new media, is
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.280]   now available to me.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.960]   As a matter of fact, I even get a little hostile now because Steve Canyon, like the really
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:55.400]   great classic milk canyon strip, just started getting rerun from strip number one three
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   weeks ago.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.120]   And comic tasks got it for two and a half weeks.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.120]   And then I don't know why.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.680]   I guess the person who was putting it up online didn't like that because all of a sudden
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.600]   comic plastic won't download it anymore.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.640]   And I'm like, no, it's an adventure strip.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.640]   There's an outgoing storyline.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.240]   Steve Canyon, you still get your Mary.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.680]   You still get your Mary Worth.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.040]   Mary Worth got to have Mary Worth.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.040]   That's OK.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:21.080]   Leop, have your finger ready for the for the rat hole button because I'm going to have
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   to address this.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.520]   Oh, Milton can't if you're if you're mocking a milk can.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:30.280]   It was produced in 90 in the in the early 40s.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:35.200]   The early 40s was like the adventure, pulse, comic strips that you really need to get into.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.800]   Dude, look for it online.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.320]   Read the first week's worth and you'll like it.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.800]   I grew up reading Steve Canyon.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   There you go.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.800]   He's got the square.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.160]   He's got the squared Merlin man jaw there.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.000]   So he's a hideous freak.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.240]   Catchers me with a wig folks.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.240]   Oh, HD.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.240]   I love that.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.240]   I love that.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.560]   Best of all, comic plastic is free, free, free.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.880]   So free.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.880]   We like it.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.880]   It's a zero Alex.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.480]   Alex, Lindsay, you have anything expensive for us to buy these days?
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:04.960]   No, no, I don't.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.760]   You showed some really cool stuff now.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.760]   Come on now.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.760]   Don't stop now.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:14.640]   Actually, Andy, I want to I want you to know that Alex showed your de gritter program
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.720]   on the noise ninja noise ninja on the lab.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:18.720]   We gave you credit.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.720]   We love that program.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.720]   Awesome.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:25.320]   Yeah, it was you know, I was listening to the show and I and I down really on the show.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:26.320]   I wasn't even on the show.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.600]   I was listening to our show and I and I heard it and I was like, Oh, I'm going to give
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.680]   that a shot and it worked.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:30.680]   It works really well.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.680]   It's amazing.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.680]   Yeah, I thought it was a lot of fun.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:36.480]   And if you turn it all the dials way up, it turns into kind of like a painterly kind
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.520]   of thing, which is also kind of cool.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.400]   You lift the kick out of the rain.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   So I have a geeky I have a geeky one, but a but a cheap one.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.400]   It's free.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.880]   In fact, I'm not really it's not something you have to download.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:49.560]   It's actually just hidden on most of our mags.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:54.000]   And and I just it's one of those things that I I do to with a fair bit on the plane.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   And it's called Graffer.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.800]   Have you guys played with Graffer at all?
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.040]   So it's sitting inside of your utilities hidden.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.200]   So you got all these applications.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.600]   Is this a sequel to graphing calculator?
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.280]   I think I don't know.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.960]   But here's a calculator was so cool.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.480]   And the story you know the story of graphing calculator and he hurts felt that it got
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   snuck in.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:17.480]   Yeah, if you haven't read it, go to folklord.org and read the history of graphing calculator.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:22.520]   The guy who wrote it state was fired and continued to work at Apple for another year.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.080]   Nobody knew he still had his card.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.760]   He would go in and write it and it and and then showed it somebody and they said,
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   this is good.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.760]   They totally snuck it into the release.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.760]   They put it in.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.240]   Unofficially they just put it in the release.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.560]   Now they killed the graphing calculator, but Graffer is still a right.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.560]   It's in the utilities folder.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.120]   I think that's one reason people don't see it.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.120]   So it's hidden in there.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:44.120]   And then there's all this boring stuff in there that you don't normally want to use.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:49.120]   But but there's this Graffer and I just opened it up randomly not too long ago, actually.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.560]   And just to figure out I was figuring out what I had to throw away because I was running
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.560]   on a space.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.240]   So literally I just started going to work at what?
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   Why not?
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.240]   Yes.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.440]   And if I opened it up and it was it was really cool.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.720]   And if you click on, there's a 3D graph and if you click on it and you say open, what's
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:08.760]   crazy is is that you will get a you can they have little examples.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:14.440]   So there'll be like a, you know, a vector field or a and it has the actual equations.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:18.560]   So you see the equation there and then you see the and you see the 3D representation of
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   what that is.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.440]   Super endless thing in the world.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440]   Gosh.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.320]   I just teach my kids when my kids started in graphing like fourth or fifth grade.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.040]   So where's graphing calculator?
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   Where's graphing calculator?
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.040]   And then I found this.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.040]   That's so cool.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.080]   It is such a great way to visualize, you know, what you're trying to learn in school.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.240]   That's what I was going to say when I when I was trying to learn calculus and trying
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.920]   to learn when the went from 2D to 3D transforms.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   Yes.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.760]   You know, the first time I had this 3D application in front of me, I finally got to I actually
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.240]   got out my old textbook and say, well, what does what does the cosine want?
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.600]   What does it want when you take a derivative of this?
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.760]   Where does this curve to use language?
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.240]   Like, where does this curve want to go?
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.480]   What does this function want to do?
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:02.040]   And the idea that you can just play with math like that and just have fun with it as opposed
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.640]   to just grind out numbers after numbers.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   I really envy kids who have access to this sort of software now.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   And everybody does.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   That's the goal.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   Everybody on a Mac anyway.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.520]   But I mean, what's crazy is, is you can really, I was sitting there talking to my kids about
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.200]   that because they were starting to get into algebra and we were able to just poke, you
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.520]   know, poke up a couple of these.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.520]   Yep.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.320]   It immediately makes sense why it's doing what it's doing rather than it being just a bunch
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.920]   of numbers that they have to, you know, dial out.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.600]   So anyway, it's really cool.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.400]   I don't know why they don't make a bigger deal about it, frankly.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.400]   Yeah, no, it's it's very nifty.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.200]   It's one of the coolest things on the Mac.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   Scott Borne.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.840]   Well, my pick was going to be Apple TV.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840]   No, hacks.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840]   No, no, no.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.840]   That was over the head.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.840]   Tell us all about it.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.480]   I never heard of that site.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.920]   Because, you know, I knew we'd be talking about the Apple TV.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.480]   It's like there's, there's seven hacks for tutorials.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.160]   It's cool site, but I'm going to go with my backup because I always have a backup.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.160]   You're smart.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.920]   By the way, that's Apple TV hacks.net.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.880]   Yeah, great site.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.800]   And my backup is something that I'm a little sheepish to admit.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:09.480]   But a long time ago, I found this company we all know called Ambrosia Software.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.320]   And every once in a while, I visit their site just to see what they're into.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.200]   And I found out they had a new game called Sketch Fighter, at least new to me.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.200]   Oh, awesome.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.400]   And I started playing the Sketch Fighter 4000 Alpha.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.280]   And I think like three hours later, I looked up at the clock and said, oh, oh.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   That's it's.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.280]   It is incredible.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280]   Have you guys played it?
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.280]   No.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.200]   Sketch Fighter 4000 Alpha from Ambrosia Software.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.520]   If you go to the site, you'll see a little demo.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   It is cool.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.520]   It is, that's all I can say.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.520]   It's cool.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.280]   And like everything else at Ambrosia, it's, you know, either.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.960]   It's amazing what they put out for what they get back from you.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.200]   And I just really thought, you know, if you want a cheap game, you're looking, I just
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.600]   need to put a disclaimer in here though.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.040]   It will steal time from you.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.360]   If you start playing it.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.920]   It really is one of those like classic thumbbuster arcade games with a great twist that it looks
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:08.280]   like you're, you're playing on like a, a, a, a, and the seven greatest algebra is a notebook,
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.600]   you know, all those like doodles of some starships.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   Oh, God.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.160]   And this is, this is the reason why I don't have an Xbox 360 or a game console because
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.400]   I have a job and it would not get done.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.400]   This is really cool.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.000]   I can't stop playing it.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.800]   It looks a little like, yeah, kind of like asteroids combined with like a, a, a, a, a
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   sax on or something.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.480]   Well, the neat thing about it is you don't need to read any directions.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.960]   You just jump in on the shooting.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.520]   Just start killing things.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520]   Yes.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.200]   Which means it's perfect for this gang of five.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.200]   And they're getting directions.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.200]   Directions.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:45.000]   I'm going to do mine because I always leave Merlin for last because I, you know, anything
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.720]   else, everything else is an anti climax.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.720]   What's Merlin's done is so we always save him for last.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:55.920]   Mine is a program that actually was an answer to a question on the radio show.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:01.320]   There's a really good program on the windows site called Robo form that automatically watches
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.360]   you surf and fills in passwords for you.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.960]   Makes it easy to have a different password for every website, um, so suddenly, you know,
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:13.920]   securely and people said, well, you know, as always, I got a number of people say, well,
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.920]   what about the Mac?
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.840]   There is no robo form for the Mac, but there is one pass.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.320]   Woo.com one number one P.A.S.S.W.D.com.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   It's a password manager, but also has auto fill for OS 10 works with Safari, Omni web,
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.480]   Firefox, Camino, even works with flock.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.280]   That's how good it is.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.560]   You have multiple identities.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.640]   It is anti fishing.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:41.520]   It also will prevent key logging because you're not typing and it uses the key chain, which
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.880]   means it's absolutely secure.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880]   It's a really great idea.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.880]   It's not free.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:51.800]   I wish it were $30, but you can try before you buy password manager one P.A.S.S.W.D.com.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   It's cool.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800]   It's a useful thing.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.520]   I mean, it's not, it's not sexy.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:01.520]   It's not sketch fighter, but it's, it's useful and a lot of people want something like this.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.840]   So there you go.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.840]   And how about you, Mr. Mann?
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.760]   Well, mine is not sexy per se.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:13.320]   It's nerdy, but it's, I'd like to take every opportunity I can to remind people of the awesomeness
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.280]   that's hiding under the OS 10 services menu.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.880]   This is, this is, this is like discovering an amazing closet of functionality that you
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.880]   never knew existed.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.000]   Every time you install an application and built into the system are all these great
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.760]   little things that, I don't even know how you describe services.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.880]   You can just do stuff in different places using services.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.680]   You can do stuff we talked about humane text, you know, a great way to transform into Markdown.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.160]   It's all kinds of great stuff, but it's, it's kind of hidden away.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.120]   It's kind of hidden under the application menu.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.920]   You'll see the services drop down.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.520]   And then once you go into the services menu, there's this butt load of different choices
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.600]   under there that can be kind of bewildering.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.120]   Well, there's a wonderful little thing out there called service scrubber that's put out
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.280]   by mini tricks that's at mini tricks.com m a n y tricks.com.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.880]   And it does two things.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.360]   It's first of all, it's done by, I think it's, I think that it looks to me like this is
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.360]   Peter Marr.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   Is that the guy's name?
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.360]   The guy who did butler.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.360]   Oh, Peter Marr is great.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.360]   And guy who didn't, you know what he, you know what else he did Leo.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.520]   Yes, I do.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.240]   He did text, text spander, coom became text expanded, which we love.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.240]   That's right.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.200]   Service scrubber, when you pull it up, it's an application.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.840]   You pull it up and you see a list of all of the applications that have installed services
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:28.680]   on your Mac and you have the ability to go in and shut off any or all of the services
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.520]   sub menus so they won't appear, which is great.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.280]   So you can, so there's stuff that you just never use.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280]   You want to get rid of.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.240]   It makes it really easy to kind of clean up that whole area.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.360]   But better still, you can go in and change the key mappings for any of the services that
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.360]   are in there.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.640]   So if you've got one problem you run into is that sometimes one service menu that you
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.720]   want to use will step on another because people are kind of developing the stuff independently.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.480]   You can go in there and say, you know what, I never use the service, shut it off or I
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.600]   do use the service, but remove the key binding for it.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.920]   And you know, this is kind of a hack inside of a hack because you really should be least
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.680]   checking out the services that are in there because there's great stuff.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.680]   And this will make it a lot easier to make a part of your workflow every day service
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:06.680]   scrubber.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:07.920]   Excellent.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.080]   You guys still do wines?
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.160]   I'm so tired of wines.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.920]   I want a wine about the wines.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   No.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.920]   You want me to do wines or should we eliminate the wine boy?
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.440]   I think that was your wine Leo.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.040]   I don't want a wine.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040]   You guys have any wines.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040]   You can skip it this week.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.360]   I think we can skip it this week.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.360]   You got any wine.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.760]   I kind of want to just have a weekly wine about I cow.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.960]   If I could just have about five minutes every week where I just talk about how ascii cow
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.840]   is, let's just, you know, maybe firewall a little time.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.480]   How what it is, how what it is.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.880]   No, I'm saying it again.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.880]   Functionally.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   It is sassy.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.880]   It is.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.880]   That's what I thought he was saying.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.880]   I just wanted to trust that.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.880]   Shashi.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   Shashi.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:48.640]   By the way, while you were talking, I downloaded it installed and paid for a sketch fighter.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   See how it goes.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.640]   Hey, you know what?
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.760]   That's okay because I don't, I think it was you Leo.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.680]   Somebody did that to me because I bought image well as a result.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.280]   Yeah, image well is great.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:04.280]   Yeah, I use it all the time.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.280]   Play and sketch.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.280]   So I'm sorry.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280]   I should probably stop.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.280]   Your family misses you Leo.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.240]   But he thinks that we're giving him tips out.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.240]   Where's Daddy?
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.240]   Everybody thinks we're giving these tips out to our listeners, but we're actually doing
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.360]   it just so we can each other find out what we need.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:21.320]   I'll tell you that's a secret of all of the podcasts I do.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.320]   They're not about the listeners.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.440]   It's about us getting together and chatting because we love hearing, you know, this cool
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.440]   stuff.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.560]   We just want to know what's good, what's out there, what's new.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.040]   We'd be doing it even if we weren't recording it.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.560]   That's a truth of it.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.840]   But Mr. sponsor, please ignore that last thing.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   Mr. who?
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.280]   Ain't no sponsor here.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.840]   Is there a responsibility to will, huh?
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.880]   An official sponsor would be Pizziz.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880]   Pizziz.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.480]   Don't forget to mention the code.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.480]   You're not going to email.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.480]   It's so funny.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.640]   I got an email from a publicist yesterday saying, have you ever heard of Pizziz?
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.160]   It's a fabulous program.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.560]   It uses neurolinguistic programming today.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:03.840]   I thought you love being contacted by PR people who are really engaged with your work.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.480]   I got a real super naughty actually.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.320]   I think you need to push on your show.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.880]   And it's like, I finally, I just said, I didn't know what to say.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.680]   So I just said, oh, yeah, I've heard of it.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.920]   I have a coupon code if you want.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920]   You love buy it.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.800]   Use a coupon code to it to save you half off.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.800]   She's anyway.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.800]   So there were no wines.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.960]   It's been a good week else.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960]   Everybody's unhappy.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.000]   I'm not a good super code.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.920]   My laptop still doesn't go to sleep when I shut it.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.720]   That's just an old wine.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720]   I've gotten used to it.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.440]   Old wine and new bottles.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.480]   Shutting the laptop and it's fine.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.160]   But hasn't happened happenings for so long you've actually justified in your mind as a good
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   thing?
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.880]   I really should be thinking about the fact that I'm shutting my thing and actually putting
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880]   it to sleep.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.680]   Because the great thing is that now iTunes, the shares are always available to my network.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.680]   It's wonderful.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.680]   Yes, exactly.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.080]   Thank you, Steve Jobs.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:05.080]   It's the fact that it's as hot as an ironing iron when it comes out of my bag when I forget
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.080]   to do it.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.080]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.080]   That's happened to me.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.080]   That freaks me out when that happens.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.280]   And your battery slowly, like you're getting ready to get on a plane.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.760]   And little bands going, yeah.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.120]   Yeah, like it's an hour into the flight.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.120]   You can take out your book.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.120]   You take it out.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.120]   The battery is completely gone.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.600]   And it's like 120 degrees.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.600]   Yipes.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:27.880]   I'm a little bit upset because my very last PowerPC based power book now has that infirmity
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.960]   where I had to go to office max and buy a couple of those really big rubber bands just
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.920]   to make sure the lid stays shut in the bag so that when I open it up.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.920]   Very green acres.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920]   Exactly.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.960]   It's like if it were cars, they'd be like one body panel that's colored like primer.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.360]   I'm embarrassed to have this.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.960]   But I'm also sick and tired of opening it up.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.520]   I've actually seen that laptop.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.520]   You brought that on the cruise.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.160]   I remember that.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.760]   It's well, Lilith is well loved.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.760]   Lilith.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:56.480]   The worst part is I have this newer, you know, Intel, you know, Intel laptop.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.280]   And I, and I lay it on its top on the lid.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.040]   Every time I put it down, I always put it down upside down.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.040]   And I don't really think much about it.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.400]   And someone was asking, why do you put the, they were trying to figure out does it cool
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.400]   it faster or anything else?
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.760]   And it was just because my laptop, the top would always open.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.920]   So I just got into this habit of I lay my laptop down.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.000]   That's the right way to do it.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   Many people don't know that.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.720]   That's the correct way to lie down a laptop.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.440]   You know what we should do?
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:23.280]   Because like they're, if we go to a trade show, there are people who know who we are.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.040]   Let's just do something really, really bizarre.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.600]   Like put three, exactly three posts who stamps at the exact same position on all of our notebooks.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:33.000]   They'll think it's some sort of incredible insider tip and everybody will start doing
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   it.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   Everybody's doing it.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   I think it'd be fun.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   It's a meme.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.960]   We could fake, fake meme, a pseudo meme we could create.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.120]   See, that's right over the 7.4.00 L.D.L. Scottie chip.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:47.480]   And basically with that extra bit of heft, I'm getting a speed boost of point eight percent.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.480]   It works.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480]   I'm getting great.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.680]   His performance now that I've replaced my Johnson rod.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.680]   Yeah, we should get a fake term.
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.960]   Again, it's like the Canary trap, right?
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.280]   We should have some kind of a fake term.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.280]   Yeah, the phenomenal sort of Dingle Armor pre-layman.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.640]   Friends like what he said.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.760]   Guys, we're going to wrap this up.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.560]   I know we could just keep on talking forever, but I see no points since we've done a fabulous
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.960]   hour and we want to thank everybody for joining us.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.840]   And we shall join us next week.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.960]   We'll be back here with Andy Naco from CWOB.com, the Colossal Waste of Ban with.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.760]   How do you say that Chicago Colossal Waste of Ban with?
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.960]   We basically say the internet.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:26.960]   The internet.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.960]   He's right.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   So for the show.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.960]   I is the internet.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:30.960]   The internet.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.000]   Alex Lindsey picks a core.tv for all of his great video podcasts suitable for framing on
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   your Apple TV.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.120]   And of course, picks a core.com.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:44.120]   If you want to join his guild of media creation professionals, Scott Born is podango.com and
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:49.960]   also podcasting tricks.com and aperturetricks.com and wishes he thought of apple TV hacks.com.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.640]   But he does have Apple phone.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.320]   Is it applephone tricks.com?
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.320]   Apple phone show.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.320]   Show.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.040]   And just so you know, Aperture tricks is no longer.
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:02.600]   It's been made part of the conglomerate of the O'Reilly sites.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.000]   Oh, did you sell it to them?
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.600]   I'm not going to discuss that.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.600]   Oh, wow.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.600]   It is now officially part of the O'Reilly inside Aperture blog.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.600]   Richard.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.600]   Oh, good.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.600]   Paul.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.840]   It was a pitley amount of money.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.840]   OK.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.840]   I'm going to be pittled out of my room.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:21.840]   It's a little bit too inch-class.
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.840]   Little me.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.840]   Little me.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.840]   I got a par PC power book.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.840]   I got an old-style TV set.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.840]   Little me.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.640]   Everyone hates me because I write for a newspaper set of a website.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   I've had enough.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:37.440]   You should get Scott to buy you some new rubber bands.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.080]   And of course, Merlin Mann at themerlinshow.com.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.960]   And just put a new interview up with--
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:49.280]   Peter Hughes, the bass player from the Mountain Goats, who talks about how he uses LiveJournal
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.920]   to do his band's tour diary.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.920]   Very cool.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.920]   Cool.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.920]   43 folders back now also.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:59.080]   And we will all be working this week at Gear Media Tech.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.640]   So if you're coming to our podcasting conference at San Francisco, say hi.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.480]   Andy won't be there because he's in Boston.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.480]   I'm old media.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480]   I'm not like him.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.480]   I'm not just in dislike.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.480]   I'm not allowed.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.480]   Sorry.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.480]   You're old media.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.280]   I keep getting ink on people's shoes.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.680]   He still has a hat that has-- says press on it.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.680]   I'm believable.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.520]   He uses those flash bulbs that pop out.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:26.320]   Andy's always putting three stamps on stuff because he wants to be cool like the new media
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.320]   people.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.600]   I just want to show off how much scratch I got, baby.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.240]   I can afford three times 39 cents, man.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.000]   And times three, baby.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.160]   GMT is also a podcast.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.080]   You can see it at Pixelcore.tv.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.280]   And we'll be doing Mac Break Live at GMT-- I guess you and I, Merlin, will be doing Apple
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.280]   TV.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:49.000]   And we'll be doing Twit Live Friday evening, Friday afternoon.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.400]   So far, Veronica Belmont has agreed to appear.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.960]   And I imagine we could count on Merlin.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.600]   I'm there.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.200]   And I believe Dvorak will be there.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.040]   And so it should be a lot of fun.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.040]   And you'll see it.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.240]   Will we do a video version of this, Alex?
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.240]   I wasn't sure.
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.640]   I was planning not to.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.960]   But we can do that.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960]   We can do it.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.040]   We use one of those cheap HDMI cameras at you.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:22.040]   I think for that, we would need to use a high quality camera like the XL2, the $14,000
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.720]   investment.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:30.040]   Anybody want to buy an XL2 used very lightly, like four times, please let me know.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.760]   Now we're going to keep them because they'll be great.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.400]   At some day, the Smithsonian will want them.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.400]   Electric items.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.040]   And that's about it.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.360]   Mac break weekly is broke or whatever we say.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.160]   I still haven't figured that out.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.160]   Break time is over.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.160]   Break time is over.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.160]   Something like that.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.160]   But the biscuits and the oven, Melandy, we're coming home.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.160]   [Music]
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.920]   (dramatic music)
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:08.900]   (dramatic drum music)
