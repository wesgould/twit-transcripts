[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.640]   Although be fun if we could bring back
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.560]   Merlin man and Scott born I know how would that would be Scott said he'd be on any time so okay
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.720]   I just get to get Merlin and be fun. Yeah, yeah, that'd be great
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.840]   This is one of the longest running shows on twit and so it's gone through some iterations
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.000]   You started as a video only show right then we started doing video and audio
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.440]   Then we left the stop doing the video then we started doing the video again
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.560]   And it's gone through we've had a lot of good hosts. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we settled
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.760]   So yeah, we don't often have Mac news so there's a new iMac
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.120]   - new iMacs you my Mac updated iMac and new magic stuff
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.440]   And then new mouse and trackpad
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.920]   So where should we start first of all let's start with the 21 inch. This is a 4k starts at 1499
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.760]   It's so cute. It's so
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.280]   4k
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.560]   Because of 4k it would fill the screen. This is just slightly bigger. So I'm hoping you can get some palettes on the side of it too
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.920]   Okay, oh you mean like while you're editing 4k video. Yeah, cuz it's this resolution is bigger
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   It's not just two times the last iMac which was 1080p. It's 2.5 times
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.240]   So you have a little bit of extra space horizontally and vertically
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:50.520]   And then this apparently has a broader color gamut 25% broader color gamut app has always done very nice monitors
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.000]   DC and maybe Alex understands this better, but it's DC IP 3 instead of sRGB
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.960]   Which is apparently the this the digital movie theater standard. Oh interesting. Yeah, cuz we work with our sRGB all the time in Lightroom
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.120]   That's the typical, you know, there's a lot of different ways to do it
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.560]   And I think that you know it does look a little bit better
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   I think that most people will not be able to yeah Apple Apple says that it was on the lines of the the
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.400]   Professional videographers would have quote appreciated unquote a normal people would say oh that does look a little better
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   But it's really for video. It's a video
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.880]   Technology because the original panel most of the lc the led backlights they use are red or sorry are blue bias
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.320]   And what they've done is increase the red green phosphors now to sort of balance that out so you get much more red and green spectrum
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.840]   The tagline iMac retina now in colossal and ginormous
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.920]   I don't know if a 21 displays could to be considered colossal, but 4k it's yeah, I'll watch dense. I have to say
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.120]   You don't see Apple talking a lot about the Mac Pro anymore that 5k iMac yeah
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.680]   Is really the the Mac a choice. Yeah, and I and I have to say that if I'd be hard pressed to get them
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.560]   You really have to have a specific specific need to get the Mac Pro
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.000]   I think I think that the iMacs do a pretty pretty darn good job
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.320]   There when you're looking for extra connectivity and external stuff to run, you know
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.720]   There are reasons that we have a couple of the Mac pros, but but this has thunderbolt out
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.880]   So you can daisy chain it right and you have a lot more thunderbolt out so you have more you know like when you we have run out of
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.400]   You know connections on our Mac Pro one of the few people in the world who would run out of connections
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.440]   It's possible even on an iMac because with two thunderbolt portchy daisy chain and
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.320]   Well you can it's just that it then that becomes cumbersome and you're always afraid something's gonna get disconnected right?
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.120]   Uh, so uh it is now the original I love I love this the original iMac
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.320]   Uh, okay
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.760]   Which the bond i blew iMac which came out let's you know say um quite a long time ago
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   17 years ago
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.640]   97
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.400]   Yeah, 98. Yeah, I know that because tech tv had just started and we had a lot of fun with the bond
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.600]   I blew we found a bunch of very similar appliances vacuum players. It might have been a little later than that
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.800]   Was it 1988 98 or 99 98 says it right here in 98. Okay. There we go. If you could see my steve jobs movie you would know
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.720]   And we'll talk about that later. Has anybody seen it besides me?
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.880]   No, I got I got an invitation at 1 p.m. By the movie company to see it at 7 p.m
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.160]   On a day when the mbt was on a sunday schedule. So you saved yourself some hair tearing
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.920]   I wanted well. I wanted I wanted to see it and gnashing of teeth
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.240]   uh
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.800]   We have an interview I didn't interview with danny boil on sunday
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.000]   Which we'll show on the new screensavers said this saturday the director
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.960]   um
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.280]   We'll talk about it later
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   I want to do the happy stuff first
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.080]   So so here's this is fun. They made a page comparing the original 1998 iMac
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.320]   Which for some reason
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.040]   Is this my computer that it's off off center like that?
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.240]   I think the texas center, but for some reason they're nudging the iMac on its way out. Maybe
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.400]   And you went this thinner leo it's to show how how fat it is it can't even fit
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.840]   I that bothers me for some reason
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.920]   Your designer rene is that bother you the way that this is a little bit
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.520]   But it's a common trick to make something look bigger than it is like you want to make a phone look really big
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.520]   You cut the top and bottom of the of the casing off and then it looks like it's too big to fit the frame
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.760]   So somebody would just go. Oh wow, that's fat. Yeah, uh 14 million more pixels
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.080]   14 more million more pixels
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.520]   62,000 times faster graphics. There's that that's a statistic
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.200]   Uh
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   366 times more processing power
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.160]   Times not percent times and I think you that you probably would notice that difference
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.840]   Yeah, just a little bit, but remember you're running 1998 vintage software. So it's not you know
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.040]   uh 1,000 times more ram
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.720]   Would come a long way, baby
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.320]   750 times more storage. That's the that's the lowest multiple
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.200]   I'm containing to scroll down. I don't see the part where they're talking about how much more
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.760]   How much how much more you can upgrade it later on
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.640]   How serviceable this is
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.440]   No handle
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.240]   Well, by the way the jobs movie handle and service ability both come up. So i'll talk about that
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.840]   Yeah, also much less bondy blue and east much less i think it's aesthetically a lot 100 percent less bondy
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.120]   And no plastic no very little maybe there's a little bit on that plug
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.720]   The second where the days when apple would put color on some of their devices. Yeah, what are rose gold i'mac andy
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.720]   Those were the days
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.040]   Those were the days so
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:58.720]   I'm just saying that these props these modern modern max would not be out of place in that conference room with the 1984 videos being made
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.280]   Everybody with a dull gray metal screened
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.680]   Now we're getting rose gold next year in his gonna be your fault. Yeah, well, I would buy it. Wait a minute
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.680]   I would buy a rose gold. I'm call it pink
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.880]   What I swear to god I would
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.280]   You see a rose for your rose totally come around on pink. I have to say
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.480]   I've got the watch even in the nfl everybody's wearing pink this month
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.840]   I think pink is okay. Do you have a pink watch? Did you get the rose gold watch? Yeah, you have a problem Renee
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.680]   I'm serious. This is a review unit. So I think it's not my problem yet, but it might be eventually. Yeah, it might be
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.640]   um
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.360]   For the 4k camera in your pocket remember we were talking about this here you have a 4k video shooter
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.160]   Do not understand how you have a 4k iMac and a 4k
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.000]   Camera but an adult tv does not
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.960]   Compute well, especially since putting 4k in a set top box isn't that hard as as amazon has shown
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.440]   Um as the broku broku is shown on my individia
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.760]   Shield my android tv has shown because this to the chipsets generally support it although it is not a hard thing to do
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.560]   It does the amazon uh box to do better as far as the quality than the amazon service on the tv
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.480]   Because I gotta tell you like i got a new tv
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:21.520]   And the that's the crap tv software. Oh my gosh. That's the crap. So here's one of the problems so bad amazon
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.160]   And i think this is true of nephlix as well
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.680]   I guess the vendor makes the software. Oh my gosh. Because amazon has different software on every platform and tv's which made your tz
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:39.520]   You know the i have a panasonic you're right. It's the worst software. Well, it's just it's just that the software is is
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.760]   That's why it's slow and bad
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.160]   The video quality my kids my kids understand it completely like i don't want you know
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:53.520]   I just go back to my apple tv but my kids understand the difference between what what shows run netflix versus amazon prime and where to get everything
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.280]   And they've got it all sorted out
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.960]   but uh
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.880]   My complaint is mostly that all the video quality is just so bad on amazon that I don't find it watchable. Yeah
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:10.480]   That's the software. Okay, trust me. Wow. I know that's horrible. It's horrible. Like you got to get a roku
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.120]   That's why you get a roku. Right. Mm-hmm. So, um
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.480]   People are saying there's no 4k content. Well, that's changing almost so rapidly
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.920]   They're really a chicken or egg kind of thing there, you know and and tv's almost it'd be hard not to buy a new tv
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:30.160]   That's not 4k is your new tv 4k? There's no h.265 hardware acceleration yet, which is the next thing that they need because they do
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.800]   H.264 in hardware they do h.265 and software still like they're using it for face time
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:41.120]   But it's still that gets into the chipsets is that hvc format well and the problem with hvc is the licensing
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.560]   so the reason that hvc is is an issue is because
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.120]   the
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.960]   Empig group is they're gonna charge money like good money for for they didn't charge it for h.264
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.720]   Or they didn't charge very much. They've made it clear that they're gonna they're gonna
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.160]   Actually make some money on a lot of money like millions and possibly billions of dollars on a cpc
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.760]   so um you have some some groups like
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.240]   google and facebook that are kind of
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.440]   uh looking for open source, you know type solutions, um and uh
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.520]   But then you have but but that's the problem is is the licensing is gonna be not just expensive for the manufacturers
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.760]   Which it was before but it's gonna be expensive for
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.040]   um the content creators and so um and so
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.840]   Amy me. Yeah, no, no not in the content. Yeah. Yeah, you if you started using hvc
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.600]   You know, so that's the that's the challenge. Hope you enjoy this 720p video
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:41.440]   When you can do a been joining it you can do h.264 and 4k. It's just twice, but there's no hard work support for it
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.960]   Well, it is, but it's just twice the size. It's just it's just big it's big
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.680]   You know, it just it just means that you need a really good connection at home
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.080]   But you can do you think that apple 64
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.200]   Do you think that apple would add 4k to the apple tv if only to make sure that its own interface looks really really good
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.680]   And its own apps look really really good one would say it's also going to be used to stream photos and stuff like that
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.680]   One would think you would think so
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.320]   I think it's on the cusp and that's probably an apple probably fell on the wrong side of the cusp
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.840]   Or the the thing is is the processor
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.240]   In the apple tv is capable of 4k so the question really is are they going to do a one more thing after they released it?
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.880]   Or are they gonna do it in the spring i'm just told you can't do it. Oh, I know why understanding if they can't software upgrade it
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.640]   There's no such a huge discussion point and they ended up doing it this way and here's why I think you cannot they cannot
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   They cannot it's not software upgradable to and i bet you it's not the processor. It's believe it or not the hdmi port
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:40.080]   No because they will that's they don't support to hdmi 2 it's 1.4. Right. Oh, really? Yeah, because the hdmi
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.920]   cables the apple the new hdmi cables at apple cells at the apple store are
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:50.240]   4k, huh, that's interesting. They actually say i'm on the package i just oh but it's 4k 30 frames or 4k 60
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.240]   You know, it's 4k it's kind of a mess, you know
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.440]   4k 30 is not fine and by the way
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.280]   You brought your tv the wrong time because hdr is imminent
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.800]   Um, finally and and then so hd i know about this because scott wilkinson tells me oled hdr
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.760]   Oled you want oled hdr 4k
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.720]   The cut the blue ray players for 4k are coming out this like in the next month or two
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:21.680]   So content is going to start and because movies are shot in higher resolution in most cases 4k is a standard in ollie wood
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.120]   Yep, it's going to be a matter of them. It'll be like early days of blue ray where you have five movies
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.080]   Right, but that will be by next this time next year. There'll be a slew of movies
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.960]   voodoo streaming 4k Netflix is now streaming 4k who knows how good that is but
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.280]   Voodoo streaming 4k Netflix is streaming 4k Amazon is streaming 4k
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.320]   So i think 4k contents not the issue 4k TVs are widely available now
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.400]   In fact, if you bought as you did a new tv
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.200]   You it would be hard pressed not to get a 4k tv right and i wasn't well ready to spend more money
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.200]   I mean i already spent enough money on this i mean it's a big i wanted size and
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.760]   4k and so it it's
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.240]   You know 70 inches for a day and so i and i decided i didn't want to spend the extra money on hdr
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.640]   I've seen hdr sets which i think are look great, but they weren't enough for me to well
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.800]   The good news is you have 4k on your iMac. Yes, and that's all we're talking about for the moment
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.280]   And you can shoot and you can shoot your own content just go out and shoot your own music videos your own movies
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.720]   Shoot everything yourself like the heck with hollywood you got
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.280]   iPhone
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.360]   Wars in his in his basement the rest of us can't how well does your tv upscale
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.760]   1080p content it does pretty well
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.640]   Yeah, it's so it looks it looks pretty good
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:41.520]   Upscaled um, but i have to say that when you put actual 4k onto it. It's like i poppingly stuff
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.640]   Yes, that's what you know like it's just like you're like wow, you know and i didn't even like the first stuff i tested was not even
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:53.440]   Uh hollywood stuff i took my go pro out wow, you know and shot 4k and then i played it back on the tv and i've used the iphone yet
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.160]   Stunning i haven't i haven't put anything for my iphone on it yet, but it was stunning what
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.280]   What everybody wants to know what model did you get because now you know i got and you should but by the way
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.480]   I should understand that you will sell now a thousand tv's whatever you say
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:15.120]   So choose why so i did so really i was looking for a a breakdown of where cost became what i consider a good choice
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.720]   Visio i think i mean i looked at you know i've had a lot of different penisonic samson busio and
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.520]   um
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.800]   Bang for buck, you know the visio i felt like i was getting easy it's a 70 inch 4k
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   I think it's what they call the em series em series or whatever series yeah, and so it's not the top of the line they have a
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.960]   performance series or other
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.480]   Uh they have a vidi i mean a video file series now reference i think they call it, but you wouldn't want that one
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.560]   No, well here's the thing is that i
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.320]   There's part of me that would want that one but but not the part that has the wallet
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.840]   This is the game room thing with my kids
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.440]   um and i put a very hard limit of
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:02.400]   Of $2,000 for a for a tv i had the 50 inch viseo which i was very happy with it was like $700
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.840]   um it got pushed into work here
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:12.320]   We need we need another 50 inch 4k so off it went and so that you know i felt very crushed that i had to go out and get
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.520]   Get i think physio is really killing it i think that if if you're okay with a 50 inch the for $800
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.080]   Right hundred feet dollars the viseo 50 inch was amazing. Yeah, um i think that the uh
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:29.680]   But anyway, so the 70 inches what my my son says is the best tv ever so as far as he's concerned
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.720]   It's big it's and viseo quality is excellent
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.480]   My big thing was i spent a little extra money, but i i also calculated that i uh
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:42.000]   Well two grand is not a horrible it's not a horrible price for for a tv and it used to be so looks no more no more
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.680]   Either i go i know more think of all the money you'll save it's for me to take my kids and my wife out to a movie costs
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:56.400]   You know 75 to 100 bucks so you know i don't i only should have bought the reference because this is only $130,000 i think
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.040]   It's only 130.000. I can't remember what it is. Yeah, it's expensive. They have a 50
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.560]   65 and a
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.600]   And i do have the sound bar 100 that i already had you got the
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.840]   It definitely makes a big difference the viseo sound bar because it just links right in and you can change
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.600]   The the nice thing about the viseo is it does let you and i'm some of them do it
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.560]   But not all of them, but one thing's very important is it let you change the 30,000
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.600]   But that's for the 120 inch right the only 6000 for the 65 on a 4k
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.080]   Make sure that uhd i can do plus or minus we're talking it at odds here
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.840]   I can do he's talking about one thing on another but the they're strangely mesh
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.600]   The thing that doesn't like the it has reference audio built into it, which i think is really intriguing
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.080]   They have five one in in the tv just the room that i have it in is not nice enough comes with a wireless subwoofer
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.120]   You need at least uh doleby atmos alio you can't
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.360]   I think this has atmos
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.400]   Oh nice. Yeah, that i want atmos. That's where it comes from
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.000]   Opposing off the ceilings. Yeah, I don't
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.800]   Unless your walls are like padded like disney hall, you know
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:04.000]   And it's a lot about reality thousand dollars for a television set
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.160]   120 inches
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.920]   You know you can't get you can't actually get this in the door of most homes
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.960]   You have to take the lid off you have to take the roof off
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.600]   To get it in
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.120]   Or you're a basketball player
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.960]   120 inches would be awesome when you're having a house you're having a house built around it definitely
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.360]   H and it would be worth it
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.720]   Lisa said if we get the new studio i can buy the 120 inch for the
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.080]   But you what you do is you build a theater around a small like home theater around that
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.240]   That's what this is for this is for you. This is for you nailed it. This is shacks tv. Yes
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.600]   This is not you. This is now yours in my tv
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.600]   But the 5k iMac is more affordable than ever. Yes, it is and I know we'll get back to the Mac
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.640]   I don't expect that the reason that video doesn't expect to sell a lot of these. This is just this is visio saying
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.360]   We're no longer a second tier
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.680]   Manufacture is their Lamborghini. It's their Lamborghini
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.320]   Back to the iMac where were we
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.680]   The thing i found was interesting is that the the new 5k iMac has skipped all the way to skylake chips
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.000]   But because there's no skylake chips with integrated graphics yet
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.520]   They're either on broadwell now for the 4k. Oh, so
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:12.480]   Yeah, I guess you know the 21 inch is essentially the budget model
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.960]   How much but it starts is not that budget uses
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.200]   Iris graphics and Intel just updated the
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.560]   Broadwell with the iris graphics and that's what apple is using it's the one from the summer
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.280]   But there's no skywell skylake yet with those so they're doing skylake with discrete graphics are available
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.000]   So those are in the 5k and so those are the am and they're using amd
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.960]   No, no, no what for the goyamd graphics at ati graphics
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.120]   That's interesting using intel integrated iris pro
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.680]   20 by the way if you're doing
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.880]   You're doing spherical production just note that you that won't work
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:47.680]   So you need you need to be a seems to me in vidi at one and that anybody who's still using amd chips is like
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.720]   Also, it all seems to kind of like go back and forth between the two. I don't know why but but it's I do it's
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.280]   the ati or amd approach to graphics processors is
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.960]   Um
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:06.160]   convoluted in my opinion. Yeah, no, I I think you're not I mean every gamer every gaming machine. It's all in vidi enough
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.880]   They yeah, I knew what it does. The data is a lot more makes a lot more sense
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.720]   I mean the amd actually I think I said the ati is a little bit faster because of the way they break it down
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.680]   But it's much harder to well at least for when we were developing for it
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.720]   It was much harder to develop for because of the way it breaks everything up
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.520]   So they just write for metal now the high end iMac 5k, which of course
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.200]   I just recently bought a 5k imx right that's how of course that we needed to wait to
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.760]   I don't think skylake is significantly improved over broadwell. Is it rene?
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.360]   No, so it's the same process they're both of the 14 nanometer process
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.280]   What skylake is the is the talk updates what that does is bring the new micro architecture
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.880]   Which allows for higher performance at better power efficiency
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.080]   And you know the environmentalism is good, but it's sitting on your desk so you have as much power as you need
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.280]   So it's it. I don't think it's a huge deal at this point
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.280]   And the benchmarks i've seen it doesn't seem that much faster
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.520]   No, and Intel is doing a double talk this year. So they're gonna have kaby lake out
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.960]   Fairly soon anyways, which is also 14 nanometers. So right now it's sort of like this big blurry period
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.440]   It's it's not that you should feel bad about having broadwell
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.000]   But you might want to feel bad about not having discrete graphics
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.880]   I think the new iris graphics are on broadwell. We're considerably faster
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.640]   And for most people it's gonna be fine. Unless you're really you know, these are hardcore gamers professional users
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.400]   You know that kind of thing. Yeah, but a 5k screen that makes so much of a difference
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.080]   I'm looking at the old one leo it with his low sRGB color gamut now
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.040]   How do you live is practically black and white? Oh my god
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.400]   Well, I want my 25 percent more colors
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.640]   Seriously, and it's trying hard not to look at me because it knows
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.720]   You know what I was very pleased because this was the first generation uh the one you and i bought
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.760]   uh
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.520]   5k iMac and
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.640]   You know first generation of a lot of these things might be a little sluggish like the early iPads and so forth
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.000]   But I have not noticed sluggishness in the least this thing
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Smoking
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.560]   And I got the lowest end version and it's I've never had a single hiccup on it. It's ridiculously fast
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:10.880]   Uh any slowdowns or uh, oh it seemed to be os base more than yeah in the hardware base. So
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.200]   Uh good. Well, these are this is a nice uh slipstream upgrade
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   I'm still thinking that we should see a slipstream upgrade for the
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.920]   Macbooks pretty soon
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.920]   Kind of surprised we don't see sky like macbooks. Maybe they want to separate these announcements out
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:32.000]   It would seem to me it would be worth if you're thinking about buying a macbook waiting a minute or two
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.160]   You can yeah, you always you really always wait until you just can't do it anymore
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.040]   Wait until the end of october because you know you can't release new stuff after that for the christmas for the holiday
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.840]   Okay, so it's not it's really we're talking a couple weeks. I think probably they're done. They're ready
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.880]   Uh, and it's just a question of they don't want to step on the announcements
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.000]   So they're gonna do a week apart or something like that. That would be my guess
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.880]   Um, so let's talk about the new magic
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.080]   The magic is back baby
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.960]   the all new apple magic keyboard magic mouse to
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:09.360]   Magic trackport trackpad two first thing I do frankly when I get a new mac is a trash all three
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   So
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   That has forced touch now leo
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.880]   Oh, yeah, that might be interesting. All right. Yeah, and it doesn't have a batteries that slowly
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.680]   Breakdown. It's not like you're now
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:28.560]   And apple listen to my prayers. So I've always been complaining the my desktop keyboard is way too thick
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.120]   And they're way and the edges are way
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:37.840]   I I can't stand the fact that when I like need to put to move it to another part of my desk that i'm not accidentally pushing keys
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:43.120]   Because there's no bezel. It's the new bezel is the power key of my macbook all the time Andy. Oh, when I pick it up
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:50.000]   Uh, the the trackpad of the three I use a wired apple keyboard, which I'm very happy with it has a
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.880]   And a man is white pad on it. I like wired because the battery always dies in an in-opportune moment
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.000]   You can wire this the port for the lightning is is right on the back for both the trackpad and the keyboard
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.920]   You can plug the lightning cable in as you're using them and just keep it and just keep it plugged in
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.840]   Yeah, and it has a super cool feature where they're bluetooth still
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.400]   But if you plug them in able to say, okay, well, I'm gonna automatically pair to this device
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.760]   You don't have to do anything else. We're typing in a four digit number. I think like that
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.040]   Oh, that's nice
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.680]   That was always a little bit of a pain and I always worried about
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:26.400]   You know at boot time if I wanted to do a you know a restore or something. How does it even though I have a keyboard yet, right?
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.520]   Yep, that's that's that's actually pretty quick
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.080]   But that's also the reason why I always have a I always have a wired whatever it is standing by
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.400]   After the first time I got caught
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   For whatever reason like my wired my wired mouse like for whatever reason couldn't connect
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:46.560]   And now in a Skype call is coming in you need to have wired stuff handy. So I'm glad that apple provided that option
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.000]   They also got rid of the plastic they got rid of the the because there's no need for double a batteries
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.400]   It's no longer we've got that little piano roll thing in the back
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.960]   Um, I'm surprised
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.880]   I I was hoping that if apple released a new version of their keyboard
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.480]   They'd make one that works super easily well with the ipad pro
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.080]   Because I think a lot of people are going to look at that fabric covered keyboard and say this is great for if you
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.240]   Don't want to invest a few extra ounces and a few extra millimeters for more comfort
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.880]   But I really do want to use this as a laptop sometimes
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.120]   Uh, so I you know that there aren't any silk screen buttons for home or the other stuff that's typically on a uh, uh,
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:30.320]   On an ipad keyboard makes me wonder if they're gonna if they're even thinking about creating a version of this that's paired for the uh for the ipad pro
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   The other weird thing is that
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:40.880]   Uh, the up if they they carry over the same thing that they added to the new macbook in 2015 that people were complaining about where the direction keys
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.560]   Up and down are now split to just this to share one one key cap height
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:53.600]   And that's not great again for a desktop keyboard where you ostensibly would have plenty of room to make this more comfortable
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.520]   Because you know up and down you page up you page down use that all the time
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.720]   So it's I think I think apple apple doesn't make any mistakes. This is exactly the keyboard
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:09.440]   They wanted to make I think that they're very very well aware that if people want something more like the extended keyboard or something that has thicker
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:15.200]   Key feel or better function keys. There. There's logitech and there's other companies or they're gonna make them
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.720]   I wish that they would make that kind of keyboard with apple design, but again that it's just not their priority right now
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.280]   Why so small? I mean why
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.400]   What is the market demand for a bezel list keyboard?
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.160]   I don't they keep they keep throwing in your backpack
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.520]   No, no, they they they are really saying that this is to take it takes up less space on the desk
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.400]   I think that it's just because just as I said, I think this is just the keyboard that they wanted to make
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.760]   They wanted to make something that's pretty that seems that echoes the the minimalist lines of the iMac
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.800]   Remember that this is the iMac is a desktop computer 27 inches
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.640]   Where they made all kinds of compromises so that the the outer edge would be just a few millimeters thick
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.320]   Even if this means that you have to get up out of your chair and walk around to the back to put it in an SD card
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.760]   Or anything like that. So this so I I do think
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.680]   I'm not going I'm not saying that this is style of assumptions
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:15.760]   I'm saying that they really do think that the pleasure that apple can deliver that no other company can deliver
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.360]   Is to create this consistent little consistent design
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.920]   Consistent looking piece of art that integrates with the iMac very very well
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.880]   Knowing that other people are perfectly willing to buy a black microsoft keyboard
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.480]   That's plastic body that has a USB cable attached to it
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.640]   That might actually be a lot more comfortable to type with
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.120]   That might actually be a lot more convenient to use
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.240]   But again, since there are people who've got that cover there are not people who are making keyboards that look as cool as that
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.600]   lithium ion battery supposedly lasts a month or more between charges it has a lightning
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.720]   Cable but it comes with a lightning to USB
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:58.560]   Wait a minute. I'm confused. What it's lightning on the keyboard and then you plug that into the keyboard and the USB goes in your iMac to charge it
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.120]   Yeah, why it's a and
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.520]   Small
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.080]   Same as the apple tv remote same as reversible
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.760]   Every using light in the apple ecosystem. You already have lightning cables around you might not have micro usb
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.720]   Also, they threw in the through in the same sort of little
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:21.440]   Little nicety that they put into other devices where if uh, uh, so are the apple pencil where it takes a little while to get a full
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.080]   Month-long charge, but if you're desperate to get going
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   Uh, it will 30 seconds to go give you something like a half an hour or an hour
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.920]   Yeah in two minutes gives you about nine hours of daily or about a day of use
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.480]   Wait a minute now. Is this an any or an Audi?
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.000]   Any these are these you play into so you use the same
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.440]   You're using the same connector that you have for your iPhone or iPad or whatever in in the keyboard got it
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:50.400]   Now the only the only slight bit of controversy here is that the both the keyboard and the trackpad because they have big black planes have the port
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.320]   Right on the back so you can use them while you're charging the mouse has the port on the bottom
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.640]   So you can't charge it while you're using it
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.760]   But apple does say again two minutes gives you nine hours so you can keep work or a typical nine hour work day
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.880]   So you can charge it for two minutes while you're doing according to craycock and berry your stand up routine for your watch
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.800]   I finished charging it. I just don't use use mice because I don't usually have enough desk space
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.560]   I don't either. I'd rather just have a trackpad because that's the space it needs
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.320]   I like magic. I like mice. I the magic mouse is not to me the greatest mice ever
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.000]   But you know I never like to single app
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.240]   I've never liked a single apple mouse and I agree that putting it at the bottom is not a good design choice
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.000]   But I would argue getting an apple mouse is not a good design choice. I have so many
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.920]   I mean we can we do my logitech mice and yeah
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.840]   Place it immediately with a wired mouse, but I have a bunch of them if anybody wants one
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:44.240]   I guess I'm quite serious about eight or nine years ago at the MIT flea market
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:51.200]   Someone must been tearing down an old computer lab because I bought a box of like a dozen like generation two microsoft mouse
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.760]   90 and and they're they're really comfortable. They've got a scroll wheel
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.360]   They're fast. They're responsive and every time one breaks after three or four years
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.560]   I just simply throw it out go back to that box in my closet pull out another one
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.200]   And that's pretty much the thing
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.760]   My car mouse of all things is like the best mouse ever and I'm a lefty
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.720]   So one of the reasons I like it is because it's uh, it's uh, it's uh,
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.160]   And agnostic. Yeah, well, yeah, I mean they're they're nice
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:21.600]   They're there's another thing right. I think that apples very well aware that their companies like anchors makes this really great mouse
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.440]   It costs all of nine dollars and it's wireless
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.840]   Uh, and they know that people will make people people who just want something
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.120]   It's more ergonomic and less expensive. They've got that but they don't have something that looks good as a static device
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.280]   I was disappointed that they didn't find a better
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:42.800]   Better a more comfortable using mouse. I don't think that I think it's been since maybe version one or version two that apples had a comfortable
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.040]   Yeah, mouse to mouse to make
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:51.040]   The other round one over you know the gseve jobs movie one of the things they leave in because you don't you don't see much of the demo
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:57.200]   But you see him rehearsing the iMac bond i blow iMac demo and he says and it's got the most amazing mouse you've ever seen
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.400]   Which as everyone knows the worst mouse ever
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.560]   It's the most amazing mouse you ever saw but every
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.000]   Used yeah, I think I think the thing is consistent
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.240]   Sorry, but once they had the puck then they realized that people would be buy something that looked one way and didn't actually work
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:18.240]   And then from there on it was downhill there was a rich third party market for a little plastic docks
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.160]   You could snap onto that circle to give it a sense of up and down in your hand
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:29.120]   That indicates that perhaps this was not a great design. So the thing for me was I just like consistency so um
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.200]   Switching keyboards is hard because it always takes me a few minutes to get used to the keyboard
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.960]   So i'm using the macbook a lot now
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.040]   So if I have a keyboard that's like the macbook on this iMac
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.640]   It's great and I use a trackpad on the macbook all the time and i've been using that
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.920]   I've either been using trackbooks trackpads or wack-on tablets
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.480]   My entire career 20 years so i'm just used to using them i'm not used to using a mouse anymore
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:54.400]   So getting that trackboard pat and that keyboard it gives me consistency between laptop and desktop and then it's just muscle memory
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:00.640]   I don't like a mouse maybe i'm an old guy, but I now we should make it clear. No one's talking about a mouse with balls
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:06.480]   We're all talking about we're all talking right we're not we're these are optical and we have a title
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.600]   You know what i mean nobody's we're all talking about optical mice no because somebody says oh i hated the mouse with steel balls
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.760]   Where the problem is not really the thing i've missed about the mice with balls
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.160]   Um that didn't come out well so a lot of mileage at a how to clean
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.080]   Well then my whole thing is is that when you were talking on the phone on a conference call
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.960]   You could take your mouse and pop it open pull the ball out and clean the you know clean the ball
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.240]   The wallers but it gave you gave you something to do
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:40.320]   Rollers, yeah, they're and go the rollers and the rollers revealed that there was some mysterious gunky substance all over my mouse pad
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   I had a I had a little um a pin that comes with your shirt and I had it in and my it was sticking in my
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:52.640]   Mouse pad and I pull it out and then I like yeah coax all the stuff out of the rollers. Oh steel balls
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.680]   I love that there's a there's a Stephen Livy
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.240]   Of writing for his sighted medium
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.480]   Uh posted this really cool look into the design labs at apple
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.200]   Uh, they're designing these devices and they're the the book end for this is a story about how they have
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:15.920]   The they're focusing on the the runners at the bottom of the mouse because when they had to do a redesign to make room for the rechargeable batteries
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.480]   They had to move the they had to move the antennas because the
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.880]   Internal batteries were now like interfering with that and they got that working fine
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.880]   But now it made a sound as you moved it across the desk
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:32.080]   They didn't like and now we move over to an anoacic chamber to figure out where the south is
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.760]   And and and the article ends with them talking about how they actually
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:41.280]   Redesign the rail so that they get the nice the sound in the field they wanted to have in the original mouse
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.320]   So they're I mean it's it's it's always fascinating too
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.240]   I I'm I'm glad that apple is giving access to some people to into so what some of their some of the thought processes
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:57.840]   Because when you look at how I don't know anybody who's a fan of this mouse as design as an actual mouse device
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.120]   And that might provoke you to think gee don't they think about these things?
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.320]   Well, they do think about these things
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.320]   They're just they have different priorities
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:09.840]   And they obsess over the things that they think are really really important and the things that they think that they can do really really well
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.680]   That no other company can do it's still not still not a mouse design
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.120]   I'd recommend anybody but at least you know at least doesn't make that strange noise when they make good phones
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.680]   So yeah, this is in steven's back channel column
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.120]   Which really is you know anybody who gives steven a chance to write long articles is is good in my book
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.480]   It's interesting because apple is very you know
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.480]   They're very still very media cagey
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:40.640]   Smart people and this is a very smart thing to give somebody like steven levi the chance to write about their design team and
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.920]   And show that they all drink smart water except for this guy
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.040]   And they all wear apple watches
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:52.400]   I suppose you really don't have a choice if you work on apple this is I'm guessing you get a good
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.640]   Johnny was really give you a stink. I
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:01.920]   So yeah, the very interesting article and this is the mouse didn't sound right
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.800]   There's kate bershron who made sure it did
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.720]   It's kind of a kind of a great a great thing
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:15.360]   I like getting inside the apples of design team and they really that was a secretive place for a long time
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.800]   Yeah, so it's nice that they're giving people access
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.840]   however
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:28.400]   Yeah, it's still not something still not someone by it's it's a beautiful static object. Yeah, it's 79 dollars folks
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.000]   That's a lot of money for a mouse. Now there's the um
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.760]   I does the top still like a trackpad on the top of that right? Isn't that part of the deal with them the magic mouse
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.480]   Yeah, it's like a multi doesn't have the force click stuff
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.360]   But it's got all the multi all the multi-touch stuff
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.200]   Well, they can't have the force click stuff because the click on the mouse is pushing it. Yeah, right?
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:53.520]   There's no button on the mouse because well buttons are bad. Oh, they'll figure it out. They'll figure out a way to have no buttons on the mouth
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.920]   Magic trackpad 2 is the breath-takingly
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.880]   priced $129
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:06.960]   If I I have many as magic trackpad ones, should I trade them all in?
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:13.120]   If you want force press or sorry force click, you know, I I you know, I have force click on the trackpad on my Mac
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.800]   But I don't use it all that much. It's I don't I find it a little bit that little baffling
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.160]   I've been using your more since I've been using because I've got my brain sort of made that leap right the iPhone 6s
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.440]   I think about it. It's the it's the preview thing that I use
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.480]   I just deep click on a link even on my Mac now and see the preview of the map or see the preview of the
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.920]   The data detector or the website or anything and it saves me having to go for it and then
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.680]   Laboriously press the back
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.600]   But I do think it's interesting when you get into that ecosystem because I got used to it on my watch
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.680]   And then I started playing with it on the phone and next thing, you know, it's it is like this kind of
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:51.920]   Process that you I really like I never I never use it on the I almost never used it on the watch
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:58.160]   Use it all the time on the I on the new iPhone. Yeah, uh, and when I had the the the 2015
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:04.320]   Mac book for a couple of months. I was kind of using it by the end, but it really still hadn't clicked so
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:11.440]   But better best I I'd love to see I don't know if apple has talked about what they describe as 3d touch and what they
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.800]   Describe as force touch though. I like 3d touch
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:21.200]   A little bit about that and this is identity it's an identical mechanism to the trackpad and the new macbook and what that has is actual physical
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   Uh sensors four of them in the corners and that measures the displacement and then does the the haptic return
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.480]   Where on the iphone they're using the led backlight to sort of measure
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.880]   The very minute you changes in the pressure that you're applying to the actual glass panel
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.760]   So I think it's just it's a distinction based on technology
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.640]   And I thought maybe they would change it because maybe this is a better trademark term, uh 3d touch
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:45.440]   But they're they're sticking with force touch for the mac right now
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:54.720]   I think these new devices really show that apples become a fashion company as much as a technology company
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.920]   Don't you think no they've always been a design company
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:03.280]   Uh and as I said, I mean if this design if this was used to follow the function
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.080]   I mean the house is a perfect example of design
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.560]   I think yeah, mike leo
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.080]   I think I think you could say that going all the way back to the original mac
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:17.120]   They made a lot they made a lot of sacrifices and a lot of changes based on what they thought
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.240]   Uh what they thought this represented conceptually
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.480]   There's a reason why I mean function keys would have been really useful on the first mac
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.520]   Directional keys would have been really useful on the first mac but they really wanted to make the statement that no
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.560]   You don't need any of those things you might want them and they might be handy
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.560]   But we want you to use the mouse instead
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:39.600]   And I think that almost every mac up to that you could pass that you could point to something
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.680]   That was okay. That's not the greatest way to do that
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:49.520]   But it sure does look spiffy that certainly happened a lot more in the past 10 years than it had in the previous ones
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.800]   But I I think that it's always been about design and not fashion
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.360]   And I think that
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.960]   Definitely trying to make it you know elegant in the way that it's streamlined
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.960]   You know, I I read this article
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:07.680]   Sometimes over this last week and maybe we've talked about it in the past with the johnny. I was talking about what steve job jobs asked him every day
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.600]   Did you yeah?
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:13.760]   Was steve jobs would ask uh johnny. I've how many times he said no
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.600]   Yeah, you know, he said and he said high numbers were good
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:23.120]   Low numbers were bad. Yeah, you know, you know, but he wanted to know that you should be saying no to lots of good things
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.680]   So that you can have great ones, you know that kind of thing and it was
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.200]   It was uh or even law know to lots of great things that you have so you know, it's so they definitely
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:38.320]   You can see that approach. I know that again. Well, I don't know. I agree with it. I still like mechanical big thick mechanical keyboards
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:44.800]   That's why I still have a clock. It's still it still comes down to what is their point of view and what kind of devices they want to make
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:51.280]   They they could have said yeah, you know, it really would look cool to have a desktop that that looks like it's got this microscopic bezel
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:57.040]   But no, we shouldn't do that because then we wouldn't have a way to put the user to put the SD card in or no
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.320]   It would be it'd be nice to have a have a macbook that's a little bit thinner
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.040]   But no, we shouldn't do that because then we can't put an ethernet port in and this is our top of the machine
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:10.720]   You know, it's it's it's there there are a bunch of catchphrases that uh illustrate a lot of important points
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.920]   But you can take any one of those during your stream there's design in the service of functionality and then there's
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.120]   Fashion in the service of emotionality fashions about emotion about how you feel
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:28.240]   About how it makes you feel and by the way fashion is a great thing to do if you're a company because you can charge
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.360]   Exorbitant prices because it makes people feel good, but I
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:38.960]   I am still I'm very old fashion in terms of I believe in technology and I believe in design and service of that technology
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:45.120]   Uh, it should make you feel good, but it should but see I think a bad mouse doesn't make you feel good
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.160]   It makes you feel bad. I don't think the mouse thing is anything to do
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.160]   It only makes you feel good when you look at it
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.400]   Apple's historically just not been able to make a good mouse like historically not been able to make good web services
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.080]   It's one of the things that they've just historically not been good at but there's no hermez
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:05.040]   Trackpad or rose gold track just wait. I will maybe but so like the thing with me is like they have a very
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.240]   definite point of view they're an opinionated company and
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.800]   They they're doing things for a reason even when you think it's done
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.280]   They're doing it for a reason and maybe you disagree or agree with it
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.800]   But like the new macbook
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.640]   Phil Schiller said outright we wanted to make a mac without any ports to see what was possible with the technology
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:26.400]   Where we'd be going in a few years and we had to charge it so we added one port because we kind of had to and made it as multi-function as we could
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.920]   But our design goal was to see how far we could move that forward
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.240]   And maybe you think that's a really dumb idea
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:37.520]   But that's the idea that they had an executed on and some people like it some people don't and I think these are the same things
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.960]   They ask themselves what can we do if we create these constraints and then execute on it and they're not going to be for everybody
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:49.120]   But I prefer that than a company who sort of doesn't know what they want to do and has 19 different versions of component parts put together
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.880]   Because it's a very easy yes or no either
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.800]   I'll get this keyboard or I'll go get like the Mateus keyboard with the big clackety clack things
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.920]   I don't have to think about it too much where if there was like 16 different versions
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.680]   I would just be sitting there confused you've seen the uh michael del
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.800]   trailer you played so great
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.240]   Let me play this is this is what happens
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.960]   When you care more about engineering remember what we do is eliminate the middleman and so
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.040]   custom ordered PCs made from stock parts direct to the consumer
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.280]   That's it everyone with me
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.000]   Good
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.560]   Hi nothing new to report at del
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:34.000]   We haven't made any new computers yet so uh we'll just keep selling the old ones for now
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.680]   Okay bye
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:43.840]   Now this is just an early prototype looks great thanks uh don't you want us to turn it on
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.960]   Nah just start shipping but we need to make it great
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.000]   No you need to make it cheap what is project mp
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.280]   A mouse path free with every shipment
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.600]   Who are we as a company? What do we stand for don't think different
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:09.600]   Think saying and guys we gotta make these laptops really thick with the fans in the back
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.600]   So they can see them cooling down
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.160]   Some men want to change the world
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.960]   Let me just oh
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.160]   There we go. Why would the eevee like that?
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.000]   I don't know
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Doesn't matter nothing
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.240]   Others don't really care about that stuff
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.040]   Michael del waited PG 13
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.160]   That's the movie I want to see oh man. Thank you. Go ahead. All right
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:39.600]   Let's take a break when we come back. I will talk about the jobs movie and why you might
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.400]   Or might not want to see it
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:48.080]   Um, and uh, there's there's a lot more right did we covered the new max I think yes
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:54.240]   Yes, I think we've and the new track fads and stuff in the mouse and the mouse is it was a magical segment
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.840]   It was magical
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:01.840]   Our show today brought to you by it pro tv if you are an it professional you know

[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.680]   We did a I did a about 10 minutes with danny boil a director of the movie. I have huge respect for him
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.680]   By the way, he's doing train spotting too. Oh
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:31.440]   Well that is sad cast. Oh man. That'll go see. Yeah, he's a great director. So we wear what happened to them after
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.920]   Oh after he laughed and took money and man, that'll be awesome. Isn't that awesome?
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.880]   Yeah, that'll be so I had to you know, Danny boy. I'm talking to danny boy
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:43.680]   I was like, you know, bow down. He did slum dog millionaire. It's great. He's a great director
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.320]   And uh, you know, he came on the project
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:50.880]   There's a really good article in hollywood reporter if you want to read the oh my god
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:55.760]   The checkered past to the steve jobs movie remember it was a sony pictures entertainment movie
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.280]   And then uh, in fact you could read all of this in the hacked emails
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.280]   And then they decided they you know, they wanted to have fincher directed
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:11.440]   They originally had leonard a caprio steve jobs widow loreen pile jobs called to caprio and said, oh, don't do it
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.640]   Decaprios declined they had christian bale loreen pal jobs called christian bale
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.040]   He said not gonna do it. Remember. She's the number one stockholder in disney
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.600]   She has a little power in the world, right?
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.080]   And I think people love and respect
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:32.000]   I think from her wasn't a matter of her in hollywood. I I think a lot of people would twist their arm
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.400]   And you'll never work it. You know, you'll blah blah. I think she was just asking them not to and they
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.200]   You know didn't. I'm sure she made a case
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:44.080]   For it. Yeah, and um, and you know, I have to say that everybody who's complaining about the movie
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:50.880]   Including tim cook, uh, and uh, and mrs. Jobs. We haven't seen it. No, I haven't seen it. I'm not gonna see it
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.360]   I'll say this it's first of all, it's a tribute to erin sorkin. It's one of his best scripts
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:01.680]   It's it's really brilliantly written. It's written almost as a stage play
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:07.760]   That's in three acts the for as as we all know the first act is the original mac and tasha announcement
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:12.320]   The second act is the next cube announcement now remember
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:17.040]   You it's only the back like the half an hour backstage leading up to this. That's it
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.680]   They don't ever show the actual demo
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.600]   the announcement
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   And then uh, there's the uh, iMac bond day blue iMac announcement and it's the moments before them
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.600]   The first one shot in 16 millimeters. So it's at least it's gone. Why is it so grainy?
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.600]   I said, I guess because it's the eighties. I don't
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:40.640]   I don't know and then uh 30 35 millimeter for the second act and then digital for the third act
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.760]   So there is this unconscious feeling of we're moving through time boils brilliant
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.880]   There's some citizen cane moments the moment where
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.080]   Jobs is fired from apple
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.120]   I of course, I don't think it was like this, but it's middle of the night
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.080]   The rain's pouring down
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:05.280]   The lighting is very dramatic sculli is lit from like dutch angle and he's lit and it's like citizen cane
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.840]   It's like very dramatic is a beautiful movie if you could I wish it was named steve jones
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:18.000]   Because you could then go see the movie and appreciate the movie but for people hobs steve hobs for people like us who
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.920]   News some of the people and he hurts felt is a huge character in this movie
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:25.440]   And by the way the actor who does and he does and he really good
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:32.480]   He's the only one who actually looks and acts like the person who's he's portraying uh seth rogan as wasniak
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.000]   is
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   horrific
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.200]   because
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.680]   Well, the whole movie is full of stuff that never happened
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:44.560]   Everybody acknowledges it never happened even erin sorkin said no no i made that up
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.240]   He said it would be amazing if any of these things actually happened
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.240]   Right
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.160]   He said if any of these conversations actually sounded like the real thing that would be amazing because I made it up
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:53:00.560]   Um fast bender doesn't look like steve jobs as an act like steve jobs and is a cold son of a bitch
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.640]   And boy the first half of the movie you're on
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:10.080]   How why would anyone work for this guy? He's magito just he's he's magno. He's in he's an evil genius
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.280]   Um, but I understand for the purposes of movie making you know and he does go through
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:23.600]   A journey and and softens by the end as steve jobs did in fact, but but I feel most bad for was because there's all of this for instance
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.160]   every
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.000]   I let me give there you can i'm sure by now you've read all the articles about the inaccuracies
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.680]   For instance john scullie shows up every time even though that everybody knows that jobs never talked to scullie again after he was fired
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.800]   Right
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.680]   So he shows up each time he's and he's very fatherly and wise and give and you know he's the
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:47.920]   But what you what you realize is this is all about uh, this is theater. This is like uh the greek chorus that is
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.960]   That is talking to jobs. This is almost his inner
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.640]   Demons talking to him as he goes through this
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:59.040]   Thing but was I feel bad for was that I know was was a consultant got paid 200 000
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:03.760]   Which he by the way for people who said oh, of course was is gonna say he likes it. He got paid
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:09.120]   He doesn't need 200 000. That's that's yeah, that's not I mean I think he really wanted some input on this
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:13.440]   But they have him doing things that he says I never said any of that stuff
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.720]   It's kind of johnny one note every time he shows up all he says is you know his big thing is
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.320]   could you just mention the apple to team and
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.480]   Was this an absolutely not of jobs is absolutely not and he keeps showing up
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.560]   Could you just mention the apple to team was says I actually never said that to steve jobs
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:34.960]   I did have a 30 second call with scullie once in which I said that but that's the only time I've ever said that
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:39.040]   But remember it's erin sorcan what erin sorcans kind of saying is can you
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:45.040]   In through the voice of was is could you please acknowledge me was as mean who was the apple to team's leader?
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.880]   right and
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.880]   So it's very it's Freudian stuff right
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:53.280]   The the whole thing about lisa is complete they never mentioned
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.600]   you know
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:01.120]   His the fact that jobs has a wife and a family and that lisa lived with them happily
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:07.200]   I knew I actually spent a long weekend with jobs his wife and lisa and read his first child
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.760]   And they were a loving family. They don't mention that and I could see why loreen's not happy
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:19.120]   She's not even mentioned in the movie. It's kind of like the social network where erin sorcan portrays mark zuckerberg as
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.760]   Founding facebook because he needed a girlfriend when in fact the same girlfriend the whole way through
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.560]   I mean he had the girlfriend he got married to her they're having a baby now
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:30.480]   It's just he make it so sorcan's telling it's polemic it's sorcan
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.400]   With a with an issue that he wants to express
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:39.520]   And he does it and it's for if if it were about a non-offictional character
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.040]   It'd be fine
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.480]   And I asked danny boil about that
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:47.120]   I said, you know, if you know shakespeare was smart enough not to write about people who are still living or anybody
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:51.120]   That was still living that knew them right, but this guy passed away four years ago
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.440]   He passed away young so almost everybody in the movie everybody in the movie is still alive
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.200]   We have met most of these people right
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.080]   um
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.160]   So it's really a great work of fiction
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.040]   uh, but I really understand now why
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:14.240]   Tim and lorraine and the others were upset about this because unfortunately hollywood is very powerful and that movie will
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.200]   Become part of the steve jobs legend
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.040]   It can it depends on how popular it is or just kind of fades away
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.800]   Well, it's uh the early box office. It's not opening until october 23rd nationwide
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.840]   It's already open in a few markets in the early box office is extremely good
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:31.120]   But it's been well in four in four theaters. I've never seen it marketed
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:35.600]   A movie marketed this thoroughly even I mean danny boil talking to me
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:43.360]   Yeah, um, they really have reached out to everybody on this. Yeah, who subway post is author in new ark too. Oh, yeah
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:50.400]   um, and I think it's because and so this is so tim cook. I understand why he says they're you're exploiting
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.960]   steve
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.680]   They know this will be a hot topic because it's steve jobs and everybody has an iphone
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.120]   You know, they said everybody in the cast has an iphone as if that somehow qualified them right
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.920]   To talk about what happened to apple
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.640]   I just I feel I feel so bad
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:13.760]   Because I mean, I don't know. Yeah, maybe the royal family didn't like the queen
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.800]   You know when they when they made that movie about queen alisabeth and the death of diana
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.960]   I'm sure the royal family thought this was horrible
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.600]   Right on an accurate
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.680]   Oh, and just to me it's still it's not the part
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:31.360]   I like I want to see the steve jobs who got kicked out of apple made next failed it next and then somehow rose back with apple
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.560]   This isn't this yeah, and he's not a world famous dad like he's not a child
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:41.200]   A parental education doctorate or something. He's a technologist and I wanted to see the technology and once again
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:46.160]   It feels like we're getting a movie that they wanted to humanize maybe but the expense of what made him really interesting
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.480]   I almost feel like the kutcher movie was better
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.760]   Imagine kutcher and and that that's jobs with this was that would have been just
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.000]   87 percent right now in the rotten tomato 75 audience score
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.760]   Um, but again, not many people have seen it yet. So
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:06.480]   It could be a great movie. Just not the right movie. He's a great movie. That's the funny thing
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.640]   It's a great movie
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.640]   But what's what i'm sad about is the power of this movie to to shape a story
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.760]   It's he's a very one-dimensional in this movie. He's not
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:21.200]   I mean, there's no you wouldn't you would never understand why anybody would work for him if you saw this movie, right?
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:27.520]   I mean, that's why Andy Hertzfeld has has his archive site. Um, that's why others have lord.org
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:34.800]   Yeah, exactly and I just like like I said last week. I just hope that people who knew Steve and who are concerned about this
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:38.000]   Are at least leaving their own stories behind even if they don't publish them
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   You know, they don't want to make any profit about it
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.320]   They don't want to be seen as cash again
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:48.960]   But that doesn't mean they can't sit in front of a microphone and just tell stories and then put the put that flash drive
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:54.560]   In a safe deposit box and say this does not get released and this gets released as part of my papers
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:57.360]   I'm donating my university and it's available to researchers after I die
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:02.240]   I just don't know what we're gonna find out about that what it did though is make me really wish for the definitive
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.560]   biography and
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:07.520]   That means that's not gonna happen until there's enough perspective
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.200]   There's a reason why like david mccollocks books are so great
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.080]   Because not only is he a master historian and biographer
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.880]   But he's writing about people who have been dead for decades
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:23.120]   And that doesn't mean that now suddenly people are willing to talk but it means that you can take a look at truman's actions
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.760]   Seen decades later. You're not if you're when you're not a product of that time
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.000]   You're not being colored to think about well
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.960]   I I I was I was 23 years old during world war two. I served in europe
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.840]   So it makes perfect sense to me that he would do that at some point you need to be removed from history
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:43.120]   You also need to be removed from the inner circle
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.800]   So we're not gonna see a great
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:48.400]   I think few of us are gonna live long enough to see that really great steve jobs
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:55.440]   And the reality is I mean every by every by by op whether it's you know are all inaccurate to
[00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.960]   Very huge degrees, you know, there's things everybody's everybody's here. I mean it'd be very hard
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.440]   I don't I don't even know what I think of steve jobs
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.880]   He was such a complex human. Yeah, I don't even know if you could characterize him as anyone
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:15.120]   And I and I have uh, I've had some interactions and both were very good and some were not so good
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.800]   and
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.520]   And so I so I definitely you know have a a picture of a lot of those things, but I think that
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.160]   um what I
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.200]   um
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.080]   What I was left with was just an incredible intensity for
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.400]   producing a result, you know, like like you know and if you were in that light
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.680]   if you were in the the vision that he was going towards you got an enormous amount of energy and if you
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.720]   Looked like an impediment then you you know, the part of the problem is that
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:51.200]   steve jobs is like lennon like john lennon. He's like he's like a hero for many of us
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.080]   and it's going to be really hard
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.240]   for the
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.240]   I I just I mean
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:05.280]   It almost feels sacrilegious. That's that's the depth of which it bothers me, but that's also that's also a good point
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.480]   I mean people
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:12.880]   Uh, it must be so rough to be a friend or a family member of these famous people knowing that so many people
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:19.680]   Positively or negatively want to cast steve jobs your husband your father your friend in a role that
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.880]   That person is going to find very very useful. So I
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.440]   oftentimes I think that uh
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:32.800]   steve wasniak steve jobs and john lennon and paul macartney there people that very much need paul macartney to be the good the good guy and for
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.960]   john lennon to be the drug
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.040]   druggie wife beating hippie who
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:42.800]   Burned out very very early and there are people for whom they need john lennon to be the person who worked for peace he worked for quality
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.880]   He wrote imagine paul was the south who just wanted to write pop stupid pop songs
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.600]   And the same thing I think is often at work between uh, our heroes and engineering
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.960]   Yeah, there's some there are moments in the movie where it's like an arrow to the heart
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.400]   at one point jobs and was or fighting
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.920]   And was says people think i'm ringo
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:08.240]   They think you're you're they think you're john lennon i'm john lennon. You didn't do anything. I wrote the songs
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.640]   And uh, and he and then jobs calls him rain man. He said hard rain man
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.280]   it's I just it's like
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.560]   Yeah, it's arrows to the heart. So if you've if
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.120]   You know, I and it's a great movie and swarcan is probably at his best. He's the the dialogue is amazing
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.120]   I just wish it wasn't about people I knew
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.440]   sure, you know
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.240]   And uh, danny boil. I really enjoyed talking to him
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.400]   He is a great director
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:40.880]   And his vision in this movie is brilliant. I mean it's really well executed because it's kind of a claustrophobic movie if you think about it
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.680]   Your backstage in an auditorium
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.640]   And they actually shot it at the flint center
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.840]   The first one and they shot the second one at the opera house in san francisco
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.640]   He said we didn't go back to the flint center for the third one even though steve did because we wanted a new venue
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.120]   I don't know what the third venue is but um, it's very that part is
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.160]   And you know as soon as a taney you have
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.600]   For some reason steves wandering up in the rafters on the catwalk and there's what i mean that's just
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:15.040]   It's I I want to link back to something we were talking about earlier that it's it's very very clear that
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.800]   danny boil and the producers of this movie weren't careless and they weren't
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.960]   Uh thoughtless they made the movie that they wanted to make there's i've been reading like any hurts fell did a blog post about
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:30.800]   Uh how much time he spent talking to the filmmakers and how I don't I don't want to put the words in his mouth
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.600]   The impression I got from the blog post was that he was impressed with how much care they wanted to put into this
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:41.200]   Scott canaster also uh wrote a blog post who was you know, this legendary right work
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.640]   He was on the uh the mac team on the general magic team. I think he
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.560]   Uh, they moved uh moved to google and i was at google
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.880]   Uh, and he also again got an invitation to stop by and he saw that
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.680]   Uh, it was impressed by the level of detail and also the level of the conversations that they wanted to have with him
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.080]   Uh, so like they made them
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:06.480]   The the you make a product that you set out to make with the vision that you had in your mind from the point of view that
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.320]   You're carrying through to your art and sometimes it's going to be a product that's of use to people
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.840]   And sometimes it's not of use to people. Uh, I absolutely I absolutely
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.120]   I absolutely agree with your
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.680]   Concern that we don't want people to think steve jobs is the person in this movie
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.240]   I'm glad that the filmmakers are so up front but saying we are creating a fiction
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.920]   Based on a real person. I think it being very clear about that
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.400]   But then again, there's still people who think that sogari killed moza right right right?
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.360]   Yeah, and I suppose in a hundred years none of this will matter
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.960]   Well, I'll be dead when they're great and uh, you know, I mean the guy
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.360]   Michael a stool bar who plays uh, and he hurts phil just nails and he hurts phil is so funny
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.760]   Um and and he is portrayed very sympathetically, but he also said this is nothing like reality
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.240]   um
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.560]   I love michael stilberg every
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:02.160]   He's great. He's great. He's great. He was in the the cone brothers a serious man. He was in uh boardwalk empire
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.640]   he was uh in the hitchcock movie
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.560]   he is uh
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:11.920]   A mimic is good enough of first uh water because he he's even got a little vocal sound inflections
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:18.640]   Uh of of andy that's just so great and and he's so lovable. I just uh, I just adore him
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.120]   So yeah, it's an impressionistic portrait. That's one of the things they've called it sorkin clearly
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.080]   Went out and did all that research gathered as many facts as he could and then that's the other threw it out
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.600]   No, he didn't what's interesting he put words in the so he he mo- it was a mashup
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   like they have a scene with him and try to get scullied to work
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.040]   You know the famous scene you want to make sugar water the rest of your life, but it's in a cafe
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:49.120]   And it turned I don't want to spoil it. Can you have spoilers for a myopic?
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:54.080]   It's in a cafe that late at night and he's telling him, you know same things you know
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.200]   He said in a different context because I think it was on the roof or they were walking around
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.160]   But uh, it turns out the restaurant we're in is the restaurant run by steve's birth father
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:12.240]   Because there's a line in the book that mona his sister figured in the isakson book that mona's sister figured out who their birth father
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:16.560]   His birth father was but steve never went and introduced himself
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.080]   But apparently he would go to the restaurant and and look at him
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.560]   And so he says
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:28.400]   Scully says because scullied's whole thing is being is about his dad scullied's like psycho analyzing jobs
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.800]   What a weird position to put john scullion, but uh, he says
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.120]   Uh, what he says something like um
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:42.320]   Well, I would have loved to have met your father and steve says you have
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:47.600]   It's that kind of thing. This this is the steve jobs from the jaziah bartlett universe
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.600]   Yes, it's a zia bartlett
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.200]   People are mad that i'm giving spoilers for a made-up movie never mind. I won't talk about it anymore
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:03.200]   But I think that he was the he was I believe the I do believe that the point i'm trying to make is good movie great movie
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:09.920]   Maybe uh, many are saying oscar winning performance by uh, both michael fastbender and k-winzle
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:12.320]   But or oscar certainly should be oscar nominin
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.080]   But uh, I hope people won't think I hope people who don't know the real story or or some of the real story
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.200]   I won't think that they're seeing the real story here. Really understand that it is
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.120]   Completely fictionalized, uh, and but that doesn't make it not a good movie
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.040]   And I was it you and he who said just wait to the third weekend. That was me was you yeah, that was Alex
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.760]   And it's really third weekend from the main release not
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.960]   From last week. So don't see it till november. Yeah, just watch it. Just watch it in December. Well, we're watching on
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.120]   Watching on Netflix. Yeah, make it a nice holiday feeling film. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.800]   I actually like the eyes of sim book and apparently nobody at apple like the eyes of sim book which I kind of surprised me
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:53.760]   Rick tetsley's book uh tets Ellie's book, uh, becoming steve jobs was also excellent
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.400]   I mean, I I devour this stuff. I'm very interested in understanding steve better
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.800]   Uh
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.400]   Well, maybe that's part of the problem though
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:07.680]   I want to see the by the book I want I really want to read is the one that again like like david mccollack
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.000]   It doesn't try to cycle analyze the subject. It simply says here are here's what this person did
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:18.480]   Uh across his life over a great number of situations and here are the stories from a great many points of view
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:21.840]   um, unfortunately, I mean if if steve ever
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:28.000]   wrote down his own thoughts innermost, uh, that's that's that's not that's going to be buried so deep
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.280]   We're never going to see it
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:34.480]   Uh, but we're not I think it's I don't think it's I think you get into really dangerous territory when you try to see
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:40.640]   We're going to start off by talking about the adoption agency where a young boy
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.680]   lost bereft
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.240]   He reached out for a source of light never grasping it like okay. You're not there
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.560]   You don't know you didn't talk to steve jobs steve jobs did not talk to you about what motivates him
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:59.520]   So really all you can do is say it's it's it's interesting enough when you compare his management styles during his three phases
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:06.560]   Uh that apple on the ascendancy then on the outs from apple and then running next and then apple in the ascendancy again
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.600]   That's that that's why I was so interested in
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:17.200]   Sorkin's approach because uh, there are long there's a long list of reasons why the why the ashen kutcher version was terrible
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.240]   But it was just the the most glaring problem was that you teleport from him being fired from apple
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.360]   To being wooed back to apple and skipping over to what to me is the most important part and the most interesting part
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:33.600]   His time at next so uh, we'll we'll wait and see I will see it on the first weekend because i'm looking forward to talking about it
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.360]   But also because uh, you know to danny, it's a it's a boil film. It's a sorkin script and i'm gonna like it
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.200]   Excuse me. I'm gonna be interested enough. No zero sorkinism's as far as I could tell
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.360]   Um, it's really I think some of sorkin's best work
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.400]   Um, it's beautiful dialogue. There's mo and this is the other thing with there in sorkin
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.200]   You always get pulled out of the movie because you go. Oh nicely written
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.640]   I'm watching david mammon movies. Yeah, man. It's like mammon. It's the same thing
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.640]   Love his use of language. Yeah now. What were they talking about?
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.880]   Uh
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:12.320]   Our show today brought to you by brain tree if you're a mobile app developer a website developer you're looking to have
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.040]   payments in your app
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.440]   I gotta say you should not write this yourself. Steve Gibson says this you should not write this yourself
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:25.600]   Uh because security's hard crypto's hard money's hard and you don't want to screw it up
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.920]   Fortunately, there's an easy way. There is a really easy way
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:39.520]   Ten lines of code and your app can accept just about everything apple pay android pay pay pal venmo credit cards
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.840]   It's brain tree. You know what i'm talking about everybody uses brain tree. I mean if you want some recommendations uber uses brain tree
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.200]   That's really the secret sauce for uber is the payments right brain tree
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.840]   But lift uses it too
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:11:01.280]   If you got two head-to-head competitors using the same payment solution, you know, it's got to be good hotels tonight and aran b&b use brain tree
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.680]   GitHub uses brain tree you've used brain tree
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.400]   You just didn't know it because it's so sweet so elegant so beautifully integrated
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:16.080]   Into the experience, you know one of the big problems of course and as a mobile app developer you probably know this is shopping cart abandonment
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.280]   People get to the point of pay me and then they go, yeah, I don't know. I don't trust this
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.360]   I don't like the feeling i'm confused
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:29.440]   If your customers are already using a familiar payment option, you're gonna have a much better chance to convert them
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:37.040]   A couple of weeks ago. I spoke with brain trees general manager for brain tree mobile great guy really enjoyed the conversation on car. Are you?
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.920]   And I asked him about this one touch
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:47.920]   This is by the way what uber uses the one touch platform and why it's so important if they can manage to get payment credentials the first time
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.200]   The subsequent purchases are relatively friction free right you can do one touch buying and one click buying
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.600]   But sometimes the first time it's difficult to
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.880]   Convert a user and get them to save their payment credentials
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:04.240]   So the one touch buying experience effectively makes it such that if you have a paypal or a venmo account
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:10.320]   You can provide a one touch buying experience the very first time that that you as a merchant interact with that paypal or venmo user
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.000]   Which is pretty powerful and just great for an overall buying experience brain tree really has it
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.840]   Figured out and by the way fast payouts to you totally secure fraud protection and all that
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.760]   And it's about 10 lines of code. It'll integrate so easily for you
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:32.080]   In fact, if you don't have the time they'll do it for you. They've got great support brain tree a full stack payment solution support for all payment types your customers want
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:38.960]   It's a single integration across all platforms superior fraud protection customer service and fast payouts and
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:46.320]   Your first $50,000 in transactions fee free when you go to brain tree payments dot com slash mac break
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.880]   brain tree payments dot com
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.840]   slash mac break
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.240]   So i've been getting some triumphant emails
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.960]   From people who say oh, I finally figured out how to get menu meters to work
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:07.760]   on el kabetan or somebody was saying like my firewire audio wasn't working, but I figured out it's a simple terminal command that
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.680]   disables
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.680]   kernel protection
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.680]   This is
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:20.240]   This is what do you today? I we've talked about this before this is that that new what do they call a rootless feature system integrity protection? Yeah
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:26.960]   Uh, is it dangerous to disable it? I mean we didn't have it last time. I mean, you know, it's so again
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:33.440]   It's it's that you want multi layered security now because the people who are trying to attack apple platforms apple platforms are incredibly valuable
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.480]   And for a while no one really bothered with them because the mac had really tiny
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.240]   Market share but now it's a it's a vast and sprawling ecosystem and people want in on it and the cost
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.040]   It's always the cost of how much it takes to attack a platform
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:51.520]   And if you can get your virus on there, you know, we saw x ghost and and things like that recently but basically
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:54.080]   Traditionally, we had
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.160]   We're over the course of years. They've added things like gatekeeper
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:02.480]   Which doesn't let you install software outside of trusted developers in the app store and sandboxing so that if one app got compromised
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.640]   It couldn't compromise the rest of apps and system integrity protection is another line in that
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.120]   So there's something called privilege s pro
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:15.760]   privilege escalation attacks and that means that they can get some code on your machine that elevates it to root and then from there it can
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.720]   Do a lot more damage and what system integrity protection does is protects certain directories
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:23.840]   So they can't be written to by anything other than trusted apple processes
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.280]   So that even if you if all else fails if the malware detection fails and gatekeeper fails and everything else
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.160]   And the virus the malware gets on your machine
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.240]   It still can't make significant changes to it
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.760]   So it mitigates and minimizes the amount of damage it can do and if you turn that off and you do manage to get an infection
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:44.480]   Then uh, you don't have that protection anymore. So don't turn it off folks. No
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:50.240]   You're a normal human being listening. Don't stop playing with it. Get a better audio stop hacking your kernel
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.800]   You don't need to do yeah, it would be nice
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:58.800]   Uh, I presume that everybody who's you know like you mentioned this menu meters or uh, anybody who's
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:05.520]   Program stopped working. They'll fix this right. They just super duper fixed it super duper fixed it. Yeah, so just wait for an update
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:11.280]   It seems so risky and you know one of the things that makes the max so great is it is so safe to use
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.000]   I I confess I was very upset
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.240]   By gatekeeper. I thought oh man
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.040]   They're just gonna start forcing us to use the apple store and you won't be able to get third party apps anymore
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.360]   And apple didn't do that. I was wrong gatekeeper is fantastic
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.960]   And you should have it said at least that middle setting where it says I only will install signed applications
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.000]   Right you can always go to round it uh easily enough
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.960]   I just think apple's doing the right thing but they're really doing the right thing
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:43.680]   And uh, just don't mess out mess with it. Now here. I have a question for you. We we just showed this uh, article you wrote
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.600]   App store removes root certificate based ad blockers over privacy concerns
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.680]   So what's the story there?
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.600]   So they and it was actually surprising that they approved them to begin with but there were a couple
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:01.280]   Apps that came out and what they did was they offered to get rid of ads inside apps like facebook
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.240]   And what they did and it was sort of clear but not really is they had you insert
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:09.680]   Install a root certificate. That's a man in the middle attack basically
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.440]   You basically getting you to man in the middle attack yourself and it was it was a root certificate
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:18.800]   So that all of your traffic would go through this company and they would filter out the ads and it would break ssl
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.720]   TLC protection
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.680]   And they say that they don't look at it, but I mean you they're trust nobody means you literally you trust nobody
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.960]   and
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:33.680]   The ramifications of this are just far reaching and beyond what I think was properly described to people because all they heard was get rid of ads
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.920]   Inside apps and not we're gonna hand over every private communication every password
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.880]   Every secure financial transaction to this company and then they sort of bolted on this thing
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:49.600]   Where if you agreed to look at their marketing surveys they would give you points towards other stuff and it apple real has what was happening
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:54.240]   And they just removed all those apps from it. So one of these was bean choice be yes be en
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.160]   Choice and they responded to you on twitter that they're going to
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:03.040]   Change how they do things, but now that'll make it so you can't do the ad blocking inside of apps
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.560]   Yeah, because they're not really ad blocking it's sort of like when they had the old proxy
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.160]   Servities they were taking all your traffic and removing the ads for you
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.440]   They weren't actually blocking the ad and that is the only way to do it frankly
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:18.160]   You know, you know apples ad blocking does not extend to apps. It's safari only
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:24.160]   Yeah, so far. Yeah, have you noticed by the way a lot of sites seem to be getting around the ad blockers on safari
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.800]   I feel like i'm seeing more ads
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.800]   They certainly responded to it. Yeah
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.400]   We haven't changed anything and we're only seeing like I I saw an article saying it was five to ten percent of people
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.480]   And I don't think our numbers have been anything different than that
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.000]   I again I got over excited ad block ellipse didn't happen a lot of people thought it would though
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.560]   Most people just want to see ads I think
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:52.880]   Actually, it's interesting because google last week announced amp which is an accelerated mobile platform
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:58.000]   That really is all about speeding up and simplifying one of the web web access on mobile
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.840]   And one of the things it does is it prevents it eliminates javascript, which is one big source of issues
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.200]   My name is a huge source of which I know and they said only google approved javascript
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.480]   They also but they also eliminated the image tag, which is okay. Thank you
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:18.640]   My biggest complaint when I hit a site slow is that it's slow. I'm gonna like it about the ads
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.520]   I mean it's the speed it's the speed that really I tell you on mobile though
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.440]   It is not unusual for ads to make it hard or impossible to read the content
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.360]   Because they sit on top of it or they can't fit you can't find the x broken
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:33.600]   Yeah, it's broken on mobile. So there are times that that really bothers me
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.640]   But you know what the truth let's we don't have to tell anybody
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.240]   But the the dirty truth of it is we don't see ads
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:45.840]   I don't see ads. There's ads, but I just don't see them. I tune them out. I'm looking at the content
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.080]   I know there's stuff floating around
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.640]   I might have said the story before but I went to lunch with georgia
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.520]   And we were trying to find the chicken fingers on the menu and neither of us could find them
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.440]   And we asked the waiter needles they're right here on the side and it was in a sidebar in a different color
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:01.840]   Our brains are unable to see that anymore. Right. It's amazing when you know that's probably why right
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.240]   It was a banner ad
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:09.040]   Well, it's it's amazing if you've ever used any eye trackers. It's amazing how
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.360]   Especially people who have spent a lot of time on the web
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.640]   You know, you'll see these heat heat maps that go right down where all the content is and just it's amazingly dark
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.720]   it's in our biology because
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.680]   For evolutionary reasons we need to survive
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:28.320]   It's changes in environment. We have to notice and so we and cats do it and everybody does it
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.320]   All mammals do it. Uh, you start to tune out consistent
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.720]   Sounds or consistent stuff because you only need to see the thing that's important
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.120]   So that you want why they move tail tail lights around on different car models and try to get you to see the tail
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:46.160]   Remember they finally they end up putting him in the rear window. Yeah, but you're gonna get used to that too, right?
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.520]   Right
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.240]   It's human. It's just the biology of it. Not even human cats
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.920]   It's the way our you know the way brains work. Yeah, I've seen brain scans of cats
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.960]   You know with a if there's a noise at first the cat gets startled
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.440]   But after a while it recognizes it and then it doesn't hear it any literally doesn't hear it anymore
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:06.320]   And if you did hear all that's up, you wouldn't want to crazy you'd be Matt Murdock
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.680]   Dared devil
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.720]   Am I right? Yep. Oh your keyboard paid off Leo
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:19.360]   I looked at the D and there it was I was just thinking carry on on uh on um homelands homeland without her drugs
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.360]   She hears everything all the sounds uh
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:26.480]   Or Steve jobs on acid same thing there you go
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.120]   Um
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:34.720]   That that line gets in there too. Yep. It's all in the movie. It's like every quote is in the movie
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:41.440]   Portia's going to use airplay because google wants to know too much about Portia drivers
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:48.160]   And it sounds like Portia's concern a little bit is connected to actually be the fact that google is making cars
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:54.240]   Apple's making cars too, aren't they? They are but they're not asking for all the end of information
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800]   I think that's silly
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.600]   Google initially asked for that and then everyone said no and they said okay
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.760]   Then we don't want it anymore. We'll just do the regular version
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.160]   But someone of orish remembers an old conversation and got kind of nervous about it. Yeah
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.120]   So it's like how the car works like you know
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.080]   in inside stuff
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:16.240]   I mean if you hook up your uh
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.160]   Google's denied this by the way
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.960]   You've had any of those obd whatever you pop it into the thing and you can get all that information from your car
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:27.520]   Right now, but what they were asking for is to put that into the into the app
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:31.760]   Which would theoretically tell you about how the person drives and could then drive
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:36.320]   That's like my obd to port and I actually have an app that collects all that information
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.720]   Carplay to integrate with the manufacturer to provide manufacturer apps now, but that's not shared with that
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.680]   So good
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:47.280]   I think google responded to this by saying that that's uh that report was not accurate that they weren't asking for the full for the full stream
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:53.360]   The full smash they clarified that there are times when it wants to know things like what gear is the car in because that because obviously if the car is
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:58.320]   In park or neutral then you can let the driver do a lot more with interactivity than you could if the car is in motion
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.880]   Similar for acceleration similar for braking
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:07.200]   Uh, but they're unfortunately, however, that doesn't let them completely off the hook because they were a little bit cagey about
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.600]   What data that they do
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:14.480]   Uh want to get from the manufacturer, but it doesn't seem to be nearly as bad as what these initial reports
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.880]   They can i have to say from from a geeky perspective
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.880]   I would love for my iphone or or android to be able to get all that information
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.400]   Rather than having hooked something into the port because it's just cool, you know, i mean
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:29.840]   Well, there are there are these cool there are these cool, uh, would it be diagnostic devices that work via bluetooth or what i have one
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.840]   I have one and just that I would it it
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.360]   On my car it makes it difficult to get smog it turns out. Yeah
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:41.280]   That's this this this is nice. That's the nicest thing I ever got from my old car
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:45.120]   It's like I suddenly have the millennium falcon telemetry like oh my nah, it's awesome
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.880]   I can see everything going on as well
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:53.280]   Especially when especially when you have an older car like me where it's like you I used to get a lot more nervous like in traffic in the summer
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.400]   Because I don't it's it's a reliable car
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.440]   I've never had a problem with it
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:05.120]   But you know one of the things that might get it to stall out and die and have a really bad day at 995 is traffic and it starts to overheat
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.360]   But now that I can actually see nope, I've
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:13.040]   This is 260 degrees in holding I have seen 260 degrees in holding it's perfectly fine
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.080]   But i'm still gonna try to get it off the next exit, but i'm fine right now
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:20.240]   It's like it's like having a fitness watch further for your car
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.720]   Right say okay, my pulse is up like that
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:28.000]   But i'm not gonna worry because look the numbers falling down no matter how hard I try any time I have that data open it changes
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.680]   It literally changes the way I drive you sit there you come you start becoming competitive about how you're using all the yeah
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.200]   You know you can't you can't not
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.880]   Emification absolutely true
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:43.120]   But I used to I used to my commute such as as it is like into the city used to be scored by
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.160]   Not like I would be driving fast or dangerously, but I would be very very pleased that oh wow look
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:52.160]   Sometimes it takes as long as an hour this this time it only took like 53 minutes
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:58.560]   And now my ever since I started using that thing the score is yes, I got I got 31 miles in the gallon
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.720]   record
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.000]   This is a car that when it was brand new was supposed to get like 22 on the highway so you've squeezed it
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.200]   Exactly. I beat it's like getting free gas. I like beat the oil companies by driving
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.480]   And also the weirdest thing ever is like passing through a speed trap
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:24.160]   And and because like I know that the best best gas mileage has me like doing about the speed limit and not accelerating very bad
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.920]   Very and so I go by this the speed trap and they got high
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:35.920]   I've beaten you speed trap by driving safely and below the post-it-load, but I found that I've cracked your system
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.880]   I feel like i'm getting away with something
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:46.720]   I I was talking to a a bmw engineer. I said it would be really great if I could actually do things rather than just read the information
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.720]   I really want to be able to change, you know air fuel mix
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:58.400]   Actually somebody who works here has a outy that he routinely hacks
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:12.560]   There's ways to get around that stuff. I just said it so that it alarm go alarm goes off when anybody goes over 70 miles an hour lisa
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.880]   I mean, uh, no
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.520]   She hates it when I do that by the way
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:24.960]   And I always know she goes back and said did you set that alarm this feed alarm again? Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:29.440]   So good news apple tv and ipad pro will
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:36.480]   Launch online in late october not so many weeks off and hit stores early november right
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:41.440]   Can't wait can't wait. Yep. Gotta start saving now
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:49.760]   Uh, so if it's on sale on the website in late october does that mean I can actually order it and get it or just is that one of those pre-order things
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:53.120]   Free order. Yeah, so it'll still be early november
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.400]   I wish they would tell us so I could like set the alarm to get up at midnight. I want to get one
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.640]   I'm sure that I have been not very excited about the ipad pro for
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:08.640]   Or the ipad in general for a long time. I mean, it's but the pro gets your pro. Uh, yeah
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.360]   Pro plus ios 9 is
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.560]   Plus probably
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:19.600]   Oh, so this would have to come out at the same time as ios 9 i'm right 9.1 9.1
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.840]   That's what I mean 9.1
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.720]   But but I even mean just like the improvements they've just made with 9.0
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:30.800]   The ability to have split screens and ability to work really really well with mechanical keyboards. Yeah, i'll go over gandy
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:37.840]   And just to give this uh october a if you're emoji. Let me boldface by hitting command b. That's all I want
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:44.640]   Oh my god, it's switching apps by hitting command tab. What a miracle that would be on the night then
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:50.320]   For a company. I mean, it's it's funny. It's funny. So because uh, we mentioned that uh, steven levi article
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.760]   I mean, they they come back again. Well, that's that's why we put so much the multi touch into the into the trackpad because
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.080]   We still i'm very very sure you don't want to take your hands off the keyboard to touch the screen
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.560]   Unless you're using an ipad and let's wish case. Hey, you don't even care what you do
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:10.160]   Command tab. That's all I want. That's all i would be nice. Wouldn't that be awesome? Yeah
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:14.560]   And they really really thought i would just shake it you got that now with the bluetooth and ios 9 with right to the keyboards
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:18.960]   You have a man tab you do right? Yeah, they've they've they've added a whole bunch of keyboard support
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.960]   One of the and even one of the problems before was that they weren't allowing developers to get access
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.000]   That kind of access to the keyboard. So if they wanted to put in their own key commands
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.920]   It was it was going to be damn near impossible. They would have to do they'd they'd have to write
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:34.320]   Such low level code to make that work that it was just not worth it for so many people
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:39.440]   Especially given that that apple was uh had their own suite of ios uh productivity apps
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:45.040]   So I have uh the sam song
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.800]   A9 i know i feel so terrible. I want to take it back right now. This was such a
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.680]   It's like bloggers
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.680]   They're not engineers. This is one of those things that my mom called me and she was worried about what chip she had
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.680]   They're wrong chip
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.080]   So the thing is that it's it's
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:07.120]   So what what happened is apple used to use sam song to source all their chips from and then last year they used
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.960]   Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company to source the apple a8
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:15.280]   And they just they didn't have enough which is why some devices got a not a8 and some you know
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:20.240]   Didn't get up with it to a8 this year they decided to dual source so they got from sam song and from tm
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.600]   sc
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.400]   Sorry Taiwan tsm c i'm gonna keep saying that wrong
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:29.760]   And dual sourcing is hard because they both have different manufacturing platform sam song is using
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.160]   Uh, 14 nanos with 16 nanometer or 14 nanometer the other one's using 16 nanometer
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:37.680]   And those are really just branding names, but they they are different ways of assembling
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.920]   Very different sizes. I mean the chips are bigger
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:43.040]   It's sort of like and people get the wrong idea that like there's a bad chip
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:47.440]   There's no bad chip what apple does is say in order to qualify for our olympics sprinting team
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.480]   You need to make 100 meters in less than nine seconds and if you make it by 8.9 or 8.95
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.880]   That's all fine because you made it by under nine seconds
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.840]   So what happened here is the samson chip is slightly smaller
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:01.920]   So my understanding is it can run at a higher capacity for longer
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.200]   Um before it has to be brought down because of thermal constraints
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.720]   And that means that yeah, you can deplete that faster if you try really hard using a synthetic benchmark like gig bench
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.720]   Uh while the t the tmsc one t smc one
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.600]   Uh, it it it wraps down faster. So it lasts
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.960]   Slightly longer doesn't peak for as long and on the synthetic benchmarks that looked like a lot
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.800]   But apple very quickly said with real world use it's like two or three percent
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.600]   And now a bunch of sites have done testing and said, hey, guess what?
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.520]   Two or three percent
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.280]   Uh, and if you really really care about battery life, maybe two or three percent is something to you
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:39.680]   But if you want to run your processor hot for a longer time, maybe you're better off with the samson chip
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:42.400]   And it's such a multi-dimensional complicated thing
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:46.800]   That we spent like three or four days just wasting incredible amounts of ink on
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:50.720]   It's it's it's one of those things like people feel like they have to make a gate every time
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.840]   So is there an easy way for people to tell which chip they have?
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:59.520]   Yeah, you can download lirium, which is a free app and run it and if it's uh m a p p then it's the
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.720]   Um
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.600]   The the taiwan semiconductor manufacturing chip and if it's just a p p it's basically the code name for the device and
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.120]   I have the n66 AP so I lost
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:13.280]   In this or you or you gain because you have a smaller chip that can run faster longer
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.920]   I mean it depends on how you look at
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:19.760]   Don't by the way do like I did because I was looking at I couldn't figure it out
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:22.080]   So I ended up paying for the full version of lirium
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.640]   Which is I mean this is a really crappy app
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.240]   Uh, it just pulls the device through you all right now
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:32.640]   But this so there's no way to find out what the device idea is without running the program like this
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.360]   I guess there's no apple doesn't tell you and it's only six plus right
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.920]   It says the six plus or the six it's this it's the s's
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:44.480]   Right, it's only the s's. Yeah, it's only the s's the other ones were all single sourced
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.640]   So I uh, I was so sad
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:49.360]   I almost I almost threw it away
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:52.640]   I thought it's got the wrong chip. I'm gonna buy another one
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:58.560]   They're both great chips just they they have slightly different characteristics as they're made by different fabs apple doesn't fab their own chips
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.880]   And you can get more variants like this depending on the cell tower that you're on
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:10.240]   So that's a good point. You'll get more than two to three percent difference if you just if all sorts of things you leave
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.800]   Facebook running if me and Andy are on different cell
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.520]   Yeah, Facebook that's a huge impact on your body's kite
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.120]   Andy and I are on different cell towers with identical phones will have different right?
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:26.000]   It's it's a very complicated thing. So I've been uh, I've been getting such stunning battery life on the iFun success plus
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.080]   That I don't even care if it's better with a tsm c chip. I am very very happy this thing
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:36.160]   I was at uh, I was at New York Comic Con and I'll for four days last week
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:37.920]   uh doing the
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.920]   with the iPhone success plus
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.960]   and
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:44.720]   I'm that's even with even with the previous iPhone six again. I'm I'm
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:49.680]   I'm leaving leaving the house at like 8 30 in the morning hitting the convention floor
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:52.880]   Just before 10 staying on the convention floor until seven
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:58.560]   Not a single charger not back to a charge until nine and going home still with about 15 to 20
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:04.320]   So battery life after taking lots of pictures taking 4k video setting text that messages using it as a hot spot
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:07.600]   It's remarkable. Yeah, yeah
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:12.400]   And that's a real argument for getting the bigger of the two phones because I do think the battery life is significantly better
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:17.040]   It's also it's also an argument for getting an iPhone over an android device. It is in fact
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.560]   Uh, there is nothing comparable in the android space. Absolutely nothing
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:27.840]   Um, wait, I'm gonna get the new Nexus 6p which with marshmallow and a big old battery might end pretty good
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.320]   But we'll see and android M is is really really good
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:39.440]   of the the the increased battery performance is not trivial because it's doing apple like stuff like trying to sense when the phone is just not being used
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:43.520]   And so why don't we just like throttle everything down and also being a little bit more responsible
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:49.680]   But allowing apps to run combining but I'd be really i'll be really surprised if you'll get all day battery life out of any android
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.040]   I use it right now
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:55.840]   I'll use whatever has the best battery life because that really is that it's more important than almost anything else
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:01.920]   I used to have a horrible time roaming in america because the cell towers are tuned differently and that's that means that my my radio is
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:06.480]   Broadcasting longer and stronger than in normally I just put it in low power saving mode right away
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:11.280]   And it lasted me throughout the day and that's never happened before what do you lose in low power?
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:17.520]   It turns off a bunch of things like it'll it'll be much more conservative about updating data through the networks and bat
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.000]   It turns off background updates. It turns off a lot of animations
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.400]   It's just basically a lot of wisdom
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:27.520]   I mean it's you will like for example, it won't just pull your mail you have to launch the mail app
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:32.640]   You'll still not mind that i don't mind that so it's a convenience thing a slightly less convenient
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.240]   I kind of like though that an app doesn't do that in the background
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:42.560]   But just when I open it gets my new mail. I think it doesn't take that long it depends if you're flying
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:49.760]   Or if you need that note of yeah, okay some apps don't notify you unless they they have the so some of the notifications are important
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:53.680]   Yeah, I guess I know I turn off mail as you know turn up mail notifications
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.000]   Yeah, I don't want to get twitter notifications
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.560]   Last thing I guess
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.240]   If you have a lot of notifications
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.000]   It's like you can you turn them off already. It's not a big deal if you only have a few and they're hugely important to you
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.040]   And it's not just notifications
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.120]   It's all it's all it's a whole bunch of little things
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:14.080]   But and it will automatically turn off once you're above 80% again if you start charging and it'll automatically ask you to turn on if you get below 20%
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:19.440]   So I'm super happy with it. Yeah, and that'll add two to three hours of overall battery life to your day
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:24.000]   Very good. Where do you find this? Where yeah, where is that so you go to settings battery?
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.440]   It's in the battery settings. Yeah, there's a new battery tower mode low power mode temporary reduces power consumption until you could fully charge your iPhone
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:36.640]   And this is on mail fetch haste. Oh, hey series turned off
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:42.640]   Yeah, back. There's not a fish automatic downloads and some visual effects. That's not bad. I mean turning off
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.720]   Hey shlomo
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.720]   Uh, might not be a bad thing
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:52.240]   And your battery turns yellow so you can tell that it's on. Oh, yeah, okay, cool
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:56.560]   Well, it's not like I need to do it, but it's a good thing to know like if you're traveling
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.760]   No, you know, you just know you're not gonna get to a charge at all midnight
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.880]   Or if you're the big thing that always scares me is I don't have where to charge and I'm I need the alarm to go off the next day
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.280]   Right. And it's usually what I do there. I just turn on airplane mode. Yeah, that's a good idea
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:12.320]   Yeah, that usually greatly increases the
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.720]   The battery
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.200]   Well, that's one of the things I'm looking forward to with the ipad pro
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:20.400]   I got that 16 000 milliamp hour anchor battery
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.840]   And that means for a phone. I don't even for three or four days
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:28.560]   I don't even think about where an outlet is and to have an ipad pro as my main computer for a couple of days
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:31.520]   That would also mean plugging into a wall outlet would be great
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:37.200]   But I have enough to last me through two or three days. I'm good. Yeah, you kind of love elon
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:42.080]   That's a great thing
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.080]   We should have come out of
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:50.320]   I can have you killed so thoroughly. No, even remember you're even alive. You have to love elon must
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.920]   He's so commencing the art of the guardians dismissing claims that apple is poaching key members of staff
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:02.720]   From tesla to work on it's long rumored self-driving car project musk said important engineers
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.800]   They've hired people we fired
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.080]   We always jokingly call apple the tesla graveyard
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:12.800]   If you don't make it at tesla, you go to work at apple. I'm not kidding
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.600]   That's not really up for
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.600]   He also he also said
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:23.280]   Uh, when he was doing the unveiling of the model x he was talking to a german newspaper
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:29.120]   They asked him do you take apple seriously as a competitor in the automotive market and he replied laughing
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.680]   Did you ever take a look at the apple watch?
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.160]   He added no seriously it's good that apple's moving and investing in this direction
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:40.800]   But cars are complex compared to phones or smartwatches you can't just go to a supplier like
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.200]   Fox cars and it just walking here
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.360]   It's such shades of echoligan
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.080]   I mean, I guess the thing is oh, it might have some there might be some marin what he says
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:55.280]   It could be but his background's not in cars his background was in software too
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.200]   And he managed to do a phenomenal job in cars
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.760]   So the the background of the company shouldn't be a wing factor
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:06.320]   And it's just the problem is anytime you say any of that it sounds so much like the phone manufacturer sounded when apple making a phone
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:09.840]   It's so complicated you don't understand what's gonna happen here
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:15.200]   But well every see everybody talks trash like that even in steven leavey's piece. I think it was a
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:20.800]   Oh, I don't want to misidentify it, but as a senior executive that we all know
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:23.280]   I was talking about how um
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:26.000]   uh talking about I think it was uh
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:34.080]   Oh, yes, I talked about microsoft surface and saying well, you know, it's it's great that microsoft is acknowledging that we were right all along
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:38.480]   To start manufacturing their own hardware like okay, but microsoft can also say gee
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:44.240]   It's good to see that apple is saying that we were right all along to have a tablet that has a keyboard and and desktop class
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:49.760]   Software for it. So it's it's it's kind of nice to see people worth a billion dollars each
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.560]   Acting like pro wrestlers, you know, I want I want to see you on must be the feather boa
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.600]   I want to see the hook but a huge belt like over a shoulder
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.520]   What you're gonna do tim pointing at the when you're on must goes wild on you
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.920]   I want tim. I want i feel shiller
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:06.080]   Phil shiller
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:12.560]   And uh, he said it's amazing that one event validated so much of what apple does and held us up as the gold standard
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.720]   That's flattering
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.720]   Especially with surface. That's a little bit gutsy. I think
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:23.040]   All right, you know, I did order that uh surface
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:28.160]   Book because it looked pretty pretty sweet and I I think really the real thing is interesting is
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.640]   I don't think touch on a laptop is a bad idea and also awesome. I think it's actually a good idea
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.480]   I don't think there's a chance that apple will ever do a touch
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.440]   OS 10 is not a touch operating system. They're going from the other direction
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.520]   You might you might see like with the ipad pro
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:49.840]   Oh ios growing into something that there are and is on as far as I know they've had ios running on macbook airlike stuff for several
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:56.240]   Years they just haven't shifted i always feel like when uh tim cook said that they have no intention emerging to oos
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.800]   I I I felt like what he didn't say there is just eventually you'll get tired of
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.640]   The other one of them. Yeah, you know, like we'll just keep on with her
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.160]   Or like we don't merge. They'll just be one slowly dies out
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.080]   I was joking about this before but in 10 years
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:14.000]   I expect to have a little apple marble that I keep in my pocket in any piece of glass that I pick up
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.720]   Whether it's a phone size piece of glass or a 30 inch piece of glass
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.640]   We'll just have my apple operating system on it
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:24.800]   And it'll be totally decoupled and it will just understand the context of what's available whatever resources are available and it will fit itself
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.560]   I like that. Oh, you're gonna have a little marble, but that's gonna be the new apple keyboard
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.760]   We have a left button and a roll
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:38.640]   And the keyboard is my fingers. I just type to think the right thoughts
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:41.040]   Too many roles are
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.040]   That's why we only gave you two
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.920]   Hey, one of the things that happened this week is that last pass which is the password vault that I
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.720]   Have been recommending for a long time. We use it
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:56.160]   We use the enterprise version here at work. I've used it last pass and turn a lot of people on the last pass at home
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:00.960]   Was sold to a company. I'm not so fond of called log me in
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.520]   I've been looking at other alternatives and you know, there's a lot of great
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.400]   Mac alternatives like one password and dash language really came from the max side
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.920]   Um, but none of them do what last pass does as far as I'm concerned
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:18.640]   We will be talking in just a few minutes for those of you watching live on security now with
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.320]   The ceo and founder of last pass joe seagriss will join uh steve kipson and me and we'll be asking him
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:29.520]   We what the heck? We love last pass and we love last pass and I will admit that
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:32.640]   I use log me in for a little while and really grew to
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:38.880]   Slike it a lot. So I looked at it and I immediately thought when I saw the purchase I was like, oh, well enough of that
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.800]   I don't begrudge joe his hundred two million dollar pay. Yeah, well played well played
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.520]   but but the
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:51.200]   But yeah, but yeah, the problem is is that there's nowhere to go still. I mean, I know
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:56.720]   That one's a good but as a company. There's nowhere to go. I spent much of last night trying alternatives. How that work for you?
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.880]   Yeah, none of them really
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.760]   Uh, got my got me excited. No, so I'm still using last pass until such time as
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:09.440]   You know, something bad happens, but we shall see we shall see anyway. That's a little program
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:15.360]   Note for those of you watching live for those of you not do listen to the security now this week
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.200]   Let's take a break and come back with your picks of the week. I see you've got some
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.840]   I see you've got some
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.920]   But first I've got a pick for your cables. We were talking about thunderbolt. How much we love
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:28.400]   thunderbolt
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:36.000]   And if you are a pro really you are probably already know that thunderbolt was originally an optical technology until an apple decided
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.480]   Yeah, we'll go copper to get it out the door
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.840]   But really there are advantages to optical cables as you will know fast. They go very very long
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]   They go very very long
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.080]   And there's a disadvantage that a lot of people talk about when we put in our sand and we have op
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:54.640]   Orange optical cables throughout the building the engineer said whatever you do don't step on those cables
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:59.280]   Don't bend those cables. Don't touch those cables. Well, I'm here to tell you corning the masters of glass
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:07.600]   Have figured on a new kind of optical cable fiber optic cable has all the benefits of uh old style optical cables
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.840]   but now
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:12.400]   Much more robust and i'm going to do a little demo here
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.560]   Of these new optical cables they offer them in thunderbolt and now usb 3 point optical
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:21.520]   Cable the usb 3 cable goes
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:24.160]   165 feet 50 meters
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:28.000]   The thunderbolt cable 60 meters 200 feet
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.880]   Without any data loss
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.600]   Uh, they're thinner. They're more flexible. You could pinch them you could well and that's what's amazing now
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:39.600]   I've got a little demo corning gave me this laser point. It hurts me just to watch these
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.000]   I saw this demo at tes and it hurts me just to watch it as someone who uses a lot of fiber
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.960]   You're always like oh don't don't so so this is a fiber. This is the new corning fiber optical cable
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:52.960]   Um, they've stripped off the end so I could put it on this laser
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.440]   And because that's how uh fiber optics work is a very very rapid
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:00.320]   pulsing light going down
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.640]   And you can see that it's now passing through the cable
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.560]   But watch you couldn't do this
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.480]   With your fiber optic with your grandpa's fiber optic cable tie it in a knot
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.680]   Don't do that and still works. Well, wait a minute. I'm gonna really make you hurt Alex. They gave me this block
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.040]   They said try this try crimping the cable
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.040]   You know, no, no, no, no, it's do not fold spittle and mutilate try
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:27.120]   I mean, this is really good. This is a tight tight fit. I'm going to jam it in this hole here
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:31.840]   Look at that. That's you know, let's do let's do some more. So were they doing this it?
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:37.760]   Yes, it hurts. Just watching it. I love it. Oh, no. No, I know I said, I'm not gonna do that on the end
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.600]   What if it breaks? I said it won't break. Oh, so but it's fiber optic. It won't break
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:47.680]   I am crimping it four times and as a tight crimp, right? It's it's a tight bend now. What do you think?
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.000]   Will we still see the light coming from this laser?
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:56.240]   No, no, hell you say the heck you say it it takes a bending and it keeps on sending
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.400]   Isn't that amazing? I have to say these are great cables now
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:07.920]   They're a little more expensive, but you get it's because of the high speed high throughput accuracy and length and and durability these new cables
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.280]   They're really really great thinner lighter stronger
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.680]   50 thinner than traditional copper cables 80 lighter
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:23.840]   And we're gonna make it affordable by giving you a $50 off deal if you get the 50 meter USB 3.0 optical cable 30 bucks off on the 30
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:26.160]   meter USB dot optical cable
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:33.680]   This is for anybody who has and I think we all use a lot of thunderbolt and you want to be able to put the loud noisy drives
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.240]   Somewhere in a more secure place perhaps
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:40.160]   You you can go along. Well, there's some cameras like the
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.920]   Cameras or the capture cards or whatever that you may want to have all in one place
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.240]   So like the black magic cameras have thunder some of them have thunderbolt, you know connections, right?
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:55.600]   And so you can use this as a as a camera. Yeah, they're so thin. It's so cool
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.520]   Take a look at the Corning Thunderbolt and USB 3 dot optical cables
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.840]   Corning of course the best known name and fiber optics. They know glass
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:10.000]   They know how to make this stuff lighter stronger and better and now it's available everywhere for you
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.880]   But go to corning.com/twit to learn more and use the promo code to it to save up to $50
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.680]   on your usb 3 dot optical cable
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.760]   Corning optical cables we thank them for their support of mac break
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.840]   weekly
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.520]   Mr. Renee richy, what would you like to share with us as a pick of the week this week?
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.320]   I have two I have I have a pick and I have a tip the pick actually i'm going to rapid fire three of them
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:40.160]   And that is tweetbot went to version four overcast went to version two and fantastical went to version 2.5
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:45.040]   And those are all three apps that I use every day all day tweetbot is a paid upgrade
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:46.880]   But again, I'm using that eight hours a day
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:51.680]   So paying five bucks for it to me is just total non-brainer and it's got tons of great new features
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:58.400]   This is for iOS or mac iOS these are all the iOS updates overcast as streaming before it was download only so you can stream now
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.800]   Which is really nice if that new episode of mac break comes out and you just have to listen to it now now now
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:07.360]   You can do that. It's also free free free right mark goes eliminated free payments
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:11.680]   Yeah, he didn't want anyone to have to suffer with the non with the with like the lesser version of the app
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:12.480]   So it's free now
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:17.120]   But you can you can do a monthly patronage if you want to you can send them a dollar or something donate
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:18.480]   Yeah, yes, absolutely
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:21.680]   And I'm I donated the heck out of that app because again, I use it all the time
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:26.000]   So it's really worthwhile and I wanted to keep making it. I want to incentivize all these developers
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.560]   To keep making their stuff you bet you bet
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:34.240]   So those are all and the fantastic upgrade has a slightly upgrade to the iphone app and an upgrade to the apple watch app
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:39.680]   Which is you know great because that's one of the apple doesn't do reminders on the apple watch yet and with fantastic
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:42.480]   You got all your reminders there right which is terrific
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:48.640]   The tip I want to do is I I was talking to john grooper about this when the apple watch was first announced and they have a Mickey mouse
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:50.400]   licensed
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.400]   Clock face, but there was no like superman
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:56.480]   We both had superman watches when we were kids and then it struck me that with the photos
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:02.320]   Face you could basically put any cartoon character you want on it. So I don't know if I can show this
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:08.720]   I have your article. I've been watching all these posts on instagram as you put different characters on your watch. It's so
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:14.800]   It's so yeah, it's so great and I put batman on the black one and you can put anyone bart Simpson you could put
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:18.320]   You know cartman any character in my little pony whatever you like
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:25.040]   You do sometimes want to make sure that if there's bright areas you don't put them over where the actual clock information is
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:29.200]   And you don't get complications with the photo face yet, which I find is a huge disadvantage
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:32.560]   But if it's the weekend or after hours and I just want to have some fun
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:36.320]   Then I don't really care about that in fact it's an advantage not to be distracted
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:41.120]   So I just went to town I tried a bunch of them and it's fairly easy to do and once you do it
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:44.400]   You just you just keep wanting to do it and it makes the watch a lot more fun for me
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:48.480]   Could you put a bunch of them in one of one album and then have them rotate
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:52.640]   Yeah, so you get to choose what album you sing? I think it's by default
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.280]   It's the favorites album. So I just put a bunch of them like I put Superman
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:00.480]   I even put a live photo of the original Fleishman cartoon in Superman with the cape waving in the background
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.920]   So when I turn my watch you just see Superman standing there with this cape waving
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:08.320]   Oh sure if it's a if it's a live photo it'll move it'll animate. Yeah animates
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:15.760]   Which is really nice. It doesn't always nail the frame rate, but a lot of times it does and then it looks super fantastic super cool
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.320]   So it added a lot of fun to the watch you can have
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.320]   You can't Mickey Mouse taps his foot pretty well, but you can get close
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.560]   Yeah, they don't like the arms don't move like they basically they can animate a little bit
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:30.400]   But they don't move and tell the time the way the license to clock play with that
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.360]   I always I like you know, I have so much information on the Apple watch
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:37.440]   I hate to use the photos. The only thing I want is the complicate. I know
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:40.400]   I want to be able to design how my complications show up
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:44.880]   I know that's the I use that info face because it's so it's so complication rich
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:49.120]   The modular one is terrific and it actually makes use of all the different categories
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:52.640]   They've established for the company and things like carrot weather are fantastic
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.240]   Because it'll mess with you in the complication
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.040]   It'll say it's raining just kidding you can go
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.320]   Yeah, this is modular. That's the one I use just because I want all that information. My promise doesn't have seconds
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:08.160]   On the main face. Yeah, it should have seconds. You're right. What the heck?
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:13.440]   Should have hundreds of a second. Sorry. Yes. Yes, it should it should have time code on that. I'm bitter
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.600]   What is it an enough time code? Time code I can understand maybe but seconds is very
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:20.400]   following in our own
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:23.440]   What's your favorite band right now Renee you got a new one
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:29.760]   I got the product red one and I'm waiting to get the Hermes one still because it hasn't been in stock
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:31.760]   but I'm using the blue
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:38.640]   Leather one both gold watch right now, which I think is a really nice combination. Yeah, that's pretty you look like a cub scout
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.640]   What uh for sports is it still is it still the floral last them or the best one for working out and stuff because you know
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:50.000]   I've been wearing this more while I work out because it's actually a really accurate heart rate monitor
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.280]   I'm kind of surprised
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:54.080]   I like the millenez just because it really breathes like this
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.000]   It has a trench underneath it that takes away that wicks away sweat better
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.400]   But the millenez when it is a little heavy, but it it really breathes when you're doing a lot of activities
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.280]   Okay. Well, that's what I've been wearing so
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:06.480]   Still on the rub
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:08.480]   You like the rubber one? Yeah, yeah
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:15.440]   I'm not I refuse to spend the money that apple asks for these bands. So yep, this one just came with the watch funny
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.600]   Vincent niggling from slash gears
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:25.040]   I I'm a friend of them on facebook and he keeps he's a high-end watch buyer like john big's and like heaven mitchell
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:30.480]   And he keeps posting the watch bands that he buys and he buys them from panorrhai and he buys them from rolex
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:34.000]   And they're like seven or eight hundred dollars for leather bands. I guess like her man
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.040]   And it's just it's a different world leo. There's like a whole world of watch
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.160]   And unfortunately I bought a bunch of the kind of off-brand watches like like this, you know the metal ones and they're
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:44.480]   You're not as good. Are they? Yeah, I'm bad
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:48.000]   The certified ones haven't come out yet. Those should be coming out towards the holidays
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.760]   I wasn't happy my day my daily wear is a $28 ebay millenese loop and it's been
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:58.800]   Rock solid for two months has been a manly. I didn't use the do the loop I
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:01.680]   But the leather one. I mean
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:07.120]   I've shown this before this is not a high quality band if I wore this every day
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:12.640]   This will quickly be splitting and cracking right but for as a $20 thing that you have in the box when you want to
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:14.960]   That one time a year when you need it
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:21.520]   That's not that's no good. But the the stainless steel one I have is great. The millenese one is really great
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:24.800]   Yeah, the only thing I want to make sure is to
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:28.160]   Check if they're sealed because if you're mixing stainless steel with aluminum
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:32.000]   It can create a chemical reaction that that kind of destroys the aluminum
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:36.800]   Yeah, so it causes like a form of corollum. So just make sure that the most most bands are sealed
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.120]   But if you're getting super cheap stuff off the internet, just make sure that's why we're hoping for the
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.360]   Mfi certified third-party loops
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:49.520]   It's just it's just really hard for me to I look at I go into the apple store and I see these $150 bands
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:52.960]   And they look nice, but they always look
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:52:00.080]   Nice as defined as wow the free band you get with this watch is really nice. It doesn't look like a 150 product, right?
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:05.280]   So the stainless steel the stainless steel bracelet is maybe the exception
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.320]   I didn't I wasn't behind that until I really started seeing it
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:12.080]   I still I still I still think it's more expensive than a stainless steel band
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:18.240]   The only apple stainless steel band ought to be but if this were just a jewelry bracelet
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:20.800]   I could see this selling in the store for three hundred bucks
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:25.200]   So thank you Renee for your picks Andy and not go. What do you think?
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:30.480]   Mine is an update to one of my favorite apps. I think I've recommended a couple years ago
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:34.320]   a company a app called I draw that is
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:38.240]   One of my favorite apps for the entire history of my association with max
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:42.880]   Has been mac draw like it was the first really killer app for me because
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:47.360]   I'm not an illustrator. It just allows you to bang out interesting pictures
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:50.000]   And when you need a sign when you need a graphic
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.560]   And then it would take these really cool
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.800]   Shapes and then turn them into compound curves
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:58.560]   You can really do actual really good artwork with it and with complex fills
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:01.840]   And then of course apple started doing mac stop doing mac draw
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:04.160]   It's funny that you should say that because
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.680]   Lisa
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:11.360]   His long estranged daughter drew a picture on mac paint and that's what made Steve jobs lover. I didn't know that
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:15.440]   And in fact he printed out and he saved in his pocket for years
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:18.000]   According to the movie according to the movie
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.520]   And we know everything in the movie is
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:28.640]   At the end he goes, you know that drawing you did on the first mac and tush
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:31.600]   I still have it
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.600]   Made it in a bracelet for you. Yes
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:37.040]   No, it's not said you know that drawing you first did me on the mac and tush
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:40.880]   I saved it for 20 years so that now I could tear it up and throw it
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:44.240]   Crap
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:47.200]   What do you got for this? I'm sorry. You're talking about it. I draw
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:51.520]   So so I draw I draw as this is that that replacement because if you're
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:55.680]   It's adobe illustrator and these other really high-end vector graphics programs
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:58.560]   They're great if you know how to use them and if you have a graphical eye
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:04.880]   If you just want to create a sign or you need to create a quick illustration for a presentation you're doing for a graphic for the web
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:10.400]   It's way way overkill. I draw is exactly the tool that you need and they keep adding more and more features to it
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:14.800]   Uh, they've just upgraded it to version three and it has been acquired in
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.560]   acquired by auto desk and they renamed it auto desk graphic
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:24.480]   And not not not only does it come with a new new name. They've also upgraded it for the new version of macOS
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:29.520]   It now supports a pressure sensitive drawing. So you know variable with lines and curves
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:33.200]   Uh, it now supports force touch on the magic trackpad
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:40.400]   Uh, there was just a boatload of extra features. It can even uh, it can now import illustrator graphics import
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.640]   Photoshop graphics and let you edit them
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:44.480]   Uh, it's it's a hinds
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.640]   It's a hinds 57 app where the core the 90 features are all easy to use
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.000]   But then there's like a million 10 features that will let help you out
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.440]   Uh, like one chance out of 10 one chance out of 20 when you're using it
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:01.440]   The other really good thing about it though is that it's one app for macOS and iOS
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:03.920]   So it also you can take these exact same files
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:12.240]   Uh, and through continuity open it on uh, after you've remember open it on graphic for the iPad or even graphic for the iphone
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.480]   And pick up exactly where you left off
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:22.320]   Uh, and on uh, iOS on the ipad it supports, uh, split screen and uh, and you can see you share the screen between graphic and other apps
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:24.800]   Uh, and it's only a $25 app
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.320]   Uh, you gotta think that this is gonna be an ipad pro
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:30.320]   Pick right
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:33.280]   They haven't they haven't mentioned anything about support for the pencil
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:36.320]   But you gotta think that particularly because now it's an auto desk product
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:39.360]   Yeah, that they're gonna be all over this like a cheap suit
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:47.200]   It's really interesting at adobe max they announced all these auto desk apps for uh, iOS and I thought yeah, they're just they're just waiting
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:49.680]   They can't wait
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.920]   But yeah, I mean the number times I use i draw
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:53.760]   Uh, 25 bucks
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:57.440]   And I have a subscription to photoshop so I have photoshop available to me
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.760]   But whenever I need to create a graphic
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:08.160]   Uh, it just it just takes so much the effort off of your hands to just bang out of shape turn that into a curve or free handle line and turn
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:11.760]   That into a shape, uh, every almost every presentation I give
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:17.760]   Particularly when i'm traveling just with my ipad will have some sort of graphic that the night before when I was going through my slides
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:21.840]   Thing gee I really wish there were a graph that looked like this or I really wish there was an image of that
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:26.720]   And then bang into i draw then bang right back out again and there's my graphic beautiful stuff
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:30.960]   So I've always stayed away from vector graphics because I just I don't feel like I can i'm the I have enough
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.240]   Talent to do it, but i'm gonna 25 bucks. Why not i'm gonna try
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:38.880]   This is for people who can it's like mac draw is for people who can draw circles and lines and
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:43.280]   Use and use a menu to say please line these all up so that they're all centered
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:48.000]   And then here's a here's a circle. Please put text on this circle and i'll please change the color of this
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.480]   And I have to admit that I'm the illustrator. I mean I have the you know creative cloud or whatever, but
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:57.440]   I still haven't liked a single version of illustrator after like six. Oh, it looks great
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:04.080]   Everything I really I really need to go to bezier boot camp because i've been trying to use it since
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:09.440]   1.0. I still don't I still can't instinctively figure out how to make the curve goes
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:12.240]   And you pull on them and then the weird things happen
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:18.480]   Just don't drop the I had to drop on the on the tip of the curve you put that you put the anchors on either side of the curve
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:19.440]   That's all you need to know
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:22.880]   Put the anchors on the either side of the curve then you use the best
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:26.800]   Carrell on my first job to make icons. I mean all my icons in carrell draw it was not fun
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.240]   The key the key to understanding beziers is to understand
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.720]   Be splines. So if you see be a bee spline cage as soon as you just just do a search for bez
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:37.040]   You just see a bee spline cage and then you imagine
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:43.360]   The the the little arms are not arms. They're part of a cage that they just got rid of one of the lines
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:47.840]   Clear as mud. You just have to look at a bee spline
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:51.200]   Anybody
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:56.960]   I'm saying I remember how great it was with with I could if I if I still have them
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:01.360]   I just show you the for the user groups the my the Mac user group used to do all the monthly posters
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:08.240]   And the ability to simply say I'm going to draw a jagged line by click click click click click and then ask mac draw
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:10.160]   Please turn that into a beautiful curve for me
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:16.880]   And then it only takes you like a little bit of practice for you can absolutely describe what you want the curve to be
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:21.200]   And it will just absolutely make it perfectly for you. That's always what I've wanted to go back to it also
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:23.440]   Scripting it's a bee spline
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:27.920]   It has yours. You can also do you can also do things like if you're an app developer
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:30.560]   You can create a shape in there and then it will
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:35.040]   It will create the cocoa code for you to generate it within your app
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:39.440]   It will generate css so that you can reproduce something on the web
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:42.880]   Well, that's what this is great for because these are scary all scalable. It even does svg
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:48.240]   Which is fabulous. I mean kevin marks the biggest svg advocate for the web
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.880]   I'm gonna buy it 25 bucks done
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:53.680]   Thank you, andy
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:59.120]   And now the moment you've all been waiting for Alex linsies pick of the week. It's a highlight to me
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:03.440]   I'm not going. I'm not going not going expensive on this. Do not no
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:07.840]   So everybody asks and I was I want to make sure I hadn't said I hadn't picked it before
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:13.040]   But everyone asked me what I put on my watch because I I have this this rubber thing on your watch this thing
[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:15.120]   So this is this is
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.480]   Spigen
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:21.600]   SPI spigance. Yeah, they make great stuff. So anyway, this is their what they I guess they call their rugged armor
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:25.440]   Uh, no, it looks very rugged. Do you you don't have a camera for him? Do you?
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:27.920]   No, I can do mine. I can do it over here
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:32.480]   But so it just you know, it's just a piece of rubber that goes on it. You'll get to see uh
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:35.360]   And it comes with a watch face cover
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:39.440]   And I just you know, especially because I got I got the sport so I didn't want to get scratched up
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:45.280]   And I didn't want to you know how much of the stuff scratched already. Well, that's but that's the that's a piece of plastic over top of it
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:47.360]   Oh, nice. So it's uh
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:52.960]   So anyway, so as a piece of plastic over top of the glass, which is not as sharp as the I mean, it's not
[01:59:52.960 --> 02:00:01.840]   But it still works hard. It totally works. It totally works fine. Um and uh, anyway, so I'm uh, um, you know, I've been very happy with it
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:06.400]   Um, you for me actually the watch felt too small. I'm used to I had a much bigger watch before
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:09.360]   So when I put the watch on I it needs a little bit more meat
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:12.800]   But I also I'm pretty rough, you know, I carry around a lot of pelican cases
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:15.600]   And so I just knew this was a good idea. That's a great idea
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:20.960]   And I I believe in kind of wrapping the stuff I get like this, you know, you'll see that I got put these cases on my
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:25.360]   If you look at my laptop if you look at the damage that this would have taken like I have
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:30.240]   chunks coming out of my laptop cases, um, but the uh, you really do
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.120]   Yeah, yeah, no, no, if you look at it, it's like all pizza
[02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:35.120]   That would have been a real big dent
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:37.920]   It's going to look at there. You're gonna see that would have been a bit of a dive anyway
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:43.920]   So so anyway, uh, so all you know, and then why my iphone I have put something around it. Anyway, so it's a I think it's great
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:45.760]   um
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:51.120]   The only other and then the so that that's rugged armor and spiking is that right spiking wagon
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:55.280]   And it's like, you know, 14 dollars, you know, it comes with the little thing and it comes with little
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:03.200]   It comes with two of them so that you can screw the first one up, but you will yeah, so um and uh, so anyway, that's that's my that's my pick and my my tip
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:06.080]   is uh
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:11.920]   If you want to check in with your watch on united flights, it's not the united app. It's your
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.560]   It's your wallet. You have to send you have to send the the your ticket
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.480]   to the wallet to the wallet and then
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:26.800]   Then you can use the wallet and then you can look you're the geekiest person in line because you go and and the key one more tip here
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:30.480]   Yeah, is because you don't have to show them your phone. You just show them your wallet
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:36.720]   Well, you just have to show them that little QR code and so what you do though. Here's the here's the big tip. Yeah, roll it under
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:39.360]   go military style
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:40.480]   and uh
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:44.640]   Roll it under like this. See see see then then oh then it's easy
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:49.520]   See then you have it and you wear it upside down on your wrist and then is that military style?
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.840]   I didn't know that so anyway, so so then you have it like that and then you just go
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:02:00.000]   Donk and it's just you just tunk and then you're in and then you're in they just think you're a commando
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.360]   And I do that a couple times a week. Nice. It's useful
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:09.200]   I'm proud. I think I'm gonna get you know, I was I talked about getting a rubber band for sport purposes
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:11.760]   This is actually and it's you can know what's cool about it is
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:14.400]   I mean, I I played with it if you like the 14 bucks
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:19.840]   $14 and you can get white and then put it with a black band or you know if you already have one so you can kind of mix and match
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:24.000]   We're just gonna put it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.640]   I add that to my cart
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.560]   Have you enjoyed today's show?
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:32.720]   Thank you
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.720]   It's all these guys
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:38.080]   I'm just the hot air that glues it all together
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.960]   I'm thinking me as a glue gun
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:43.920]   uh, Andy and Ico Chicago Sun times
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:51.680]   Always a pleasure but listen to act if you want more Andy and not coz almanac on the five by five network

[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:58.640]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, I'm also doing a podcast called medium
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:01.600]   Uh, on relay.fm. Uh, that's all about google
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:04.480]   Oh fun medium
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:09.280]   As a matter of fact, you might this week's episode is is going to be especially fun
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.360]   Well, last week we recorded a uh, we we decided to screen the interview
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:17.280]   Uh with Owen Wilson and oh god, is that a horrible movie?
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:22.400]   Yeah, and we decided to basically talk about that movie for a good hour hour and a half so that's uh, uh,
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.960]   We it's not medium. It's material. I'm sorry learn the name of your show dude
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:30.160]   Sorry
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.240]   So I can I designed the logo. Okay. Come on. Did you do that in graphic? That's nice
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:39.840]   Material that's that's that's a good that's an excellent example that was I needed to show here
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:42.160]   Is what I think the logo really took me all five minutes
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:45.440]   after trying after failing to do it in photoshop because
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:49.680]   Very good relay.fm
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:56.480]   Uh, another guy does a lot of podcasts this guy over here mr. Renee richy. I'm more dot com
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:02.240]   I have to confess Leo last night georgia managed to get ronda ralsi's mom onto vector and we had a terrific interview
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:06.160]   Who's ronda ralsi? ronda ralsi is the ufc female champion. Oh, I know who she is
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:12.000]   Widely considered to be one of the best mixed marshall artists in history and her mom was one of the first female judo champions
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.400]   She's got a doctorate in education and she runs a game company designed to help kids learn math
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:18.080]   Which uh, it was oh
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:21.520]   Fun. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, which which of your many shows is that one?
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:24.400]   It's gonna be it's gonna be on vector up. It's gonna be up later today on vector
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:29.920]   So go to i'mor.com and and then click the hamburger menu and you can see all the podcasts
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.960]   There's a lot of them. Yep. And debug is great. There's so many good ones
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:38.240]   Thank you rene for being here. I'mor.com
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:41.200]   Alex lindsey visiting us from
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:45.120]   Parts unknown i'm off to uh, rewanda next week, but I should be
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:48.800]   Somewhere with con con activity good and then um good good
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:50.560]   tentatively uh
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:54.880]   Somewhere in southeast asia after that so if you want to know what he's up to the easiest way to find out
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.960]   Especially if he's got a you know
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:59.360]   Final cut course or something going on his follow him on twitter
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:02.640]   alex lyan d s a
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:04.960]   while in zay
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:06.960]   We start doing the big move this week
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:10.160]   The big move we're moving to moving the gear to san rafel
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:15.920]   Somebody has if if leo leaves the brick house. What's happening to Alex he left first
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:20.800]   Part of the reason we have to move is or we want to move is because uh
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:27.440]   Uh, that space is now empty. We got about a third of this space. Uh, that was occupied by the pixel core. Right. Yeah, we just needed
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:31.840]   We it was kind of getting absurd if you look at all the roadcases and stuff we were running out of space
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:37.600]   You have spaces everywhere too. I mean we have all these different spaces all over petaluma and and we and we and we
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:40.400]   We didn't have enough space for the gear anymore and we couldn't
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:46.560]   Here we would kind of shut down traffic as we moved everything out of the out of the out of the brick house for an event
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:52.960]   So now we can drive trucks into the space nice. It's the key and when will that be completed? Um
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:56.960]   January 1 I mean, I know what you mean that's just a
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:01.120]   We're hopefully getting most of an out by the or I look at the base but I think what am I gonna do?
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.120]   I know what what am I gonna do?
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:05.120]   I look at the base when I just like oh my gosh
[02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:11.600]   So what a reason people should move every five years is for that just the three rid of stuff. Otherwise you just accumulate. Yeah
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:17.600]   All right, Alex rene, Andy. Thank you so much for being here. Thanks to Jason howl our producer
