[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly the show that I did a little motorboat thing there. That was great.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.640]   The show that covers everything you need to know about Macintosh and iOS. Andy Inaco is
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.560]   here from the Chicago Sun Times and the celestial waste of bandwidth. Hello, Mr. Notgo.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.560]   And as always regaling us with ukulele while we procrastinated. That is a good procrastination
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.640]   instrument. The reason why I took up the ukulele was because there was so this is
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.720]   vectoring Mac OS nine days where something would happen and you'd have to restart. And so I'd
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.960]   find myself with all these like six minute intervals with just waiting for the machine to restart.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.680]   Perfect. And so I realized that gee if I put a device on the desk in that spot right there
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.880]   so that every time my computer lets me down I can focus on developing a skill involving that
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.120]   item. It was either knitting or that or you know or actual like or balancing my checkbook.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.840]   Knitting you would have had some socks you would have had something as a result.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.480]   Oh, Mac we're talking about Mac OS nine. I would have had a doctor who's scarf with him two months.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.280]   But you have learned something gainful ukulele. I always wish I played an instrument. Alex,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.760]   do you play an instrument? Alex Lindsey is also here for the pixel core.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.440]   Yeah, my instrument like that is the Ambira. It's a thumb piano.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.360]   Oh yeah, yeah. You could actually play quite well.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   That's because I have a lot of time free time on my computer waiting hard to start
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.040]   reading for to do some hard to do. So we're getting close.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.760]   Apple, this is Mac rumors headline. I'm not sure I really like this. Apple seeds mountain line.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.040]   I don't like it. The golden master has gone to developers.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.160]   Apple gives develop. This is CNET's headline. Apple gives developers fully baked mountain
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.480]   line. I don't like that much either. Sounds like animal cruelty is involved.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.240]   I don't know. I wonder how mountain line tastes.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.360]   A little between Cooper and what?
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.200]   Cooper mountain line. I think it's the same thing.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.680]   It tastes nutty. This is the eighth iteration of OS 10, OS 10, 10.8 or in Paul
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.240]   Thorett's words, the Ocho actually that would be nine.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.960]   Nine? There's 10.0 remember.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.840]   Oh, you're good. Was there a 10.0? Of course there was.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.760]   You're good. That was my inner Sheldon. Yeah, it was very good.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.040]   Excuse me. There were nine. If you started with zero,
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.960]   a 10.8 would be nine.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.800]   But does that put us two years off between to OS 11?
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.320]   I don't know. What do they do when they get to 10 10?
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.560]   They go to iOS 6 or 1010.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.920]   Apple first debuted the software in late February with a preview release.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.080]   It has followed up with a handful of beta versions and each going to developers.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.600]   And they say this one is the golden master. Can anybody you guys have a long experience
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.880]   with OS 10 and Apple has the gold? Have there ever been any changes after the gold
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.640]   master has shipped? Is that where they're? I guess what you'd call that is a showstopper,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.800]   a bug where it's so bad you have to actually.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.760]   That's it's usually a big deal because other ones just get a incremental, you know,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.360]   they'll release it and then a week later or two days later, they'll release an update.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.600]   Right. I see. I seem to remember GM two. I could be wrong though.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.320]   It happened some GM two's. It would have been a while ago.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.160]   Yeah. Tiger, I think had a GM two.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.240]   So it's safe to say we're getting close.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.520]   They said July could surprise everybody. One thought is, you know,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.640]   they have their earnings call July 24th. And last time they surprised everybody on their
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.080]   earnings call saying, Oh, line will be out tomorrow. So maybe they'll do the same thing today or
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.280]   the 24th, I guess. And they're also taking apps for the store. So it looks like they must be
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.360]   getting close and they're asking developers to submit. It will be good news. $20 update
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.040]   available for anybody free for anybody who just purchased a Mac.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.000]   $20 if you didn't, and that's for every Mac in your ownership. However,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.480]   compatibility might be an issue for you because a lot of even just a few year old machines
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   are not compatible. Let me just see if I could pull up apples. I'll read you apples description
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.480]   of what machines are compatible. Well, I'll read it from somebody else.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.240]   They had a problem with this in the last version, right, where you could upload update
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.280]   something with Lion and didn't actually, you know, work.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.600]   Right. Or it was too slow or here. OS 10 10.8. Actually, this is from Hard Mac. This would be
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.120]   better. This is a list of hard Macs pretty good on hardware list of mountain lion compatible Macs
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:13.280]   is at hard Mac.com. But see, I can't read this. But if you have a core to duo mid 2007 or later
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.080]   Mac book pro, if you have a Mac book core to duo unibody late 2008,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:29.680]   if you have a 2008 late 2008 Mac book air, no previous heirs, 2009 Mac mini early 2009,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:38.560]   basically you need core to duo or later. Right. The 2008 Mac pro 64 bit EFI or the first aluminum
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.600]   iMac. Wow, the iMacs are pretty compatible going back way back to 2007. And on X serve,
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.360]   you need a Xeon to hail them. And that is from the mountain lion installer. That's what the
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.920]   install is actually looking for. And then if you get excited, I mean, a lot of times these
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.120]   installers have these little checks and there's ways to hack them so that they'll just go on to
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.560]   older things, but you may not want to or would you might not want to. I mean, it's it may be
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.520]   what they're of course, what Apple's doing is they are making sure that most people will have a
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.800]   good experience. And so they're saying you shouldn't install it on here. You should just stick with
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.920]   what you have if you don't write if you don't have that. And but there are ways typically
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.960]   to hack OS is onto because it's just a check. And then you just get past the check. Now, I think if
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.280]   you if you have those machines, you probably have the specs needed, you need two gigs of RAM.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.520]   Everybody's got that. The older heirs, no, they all shipped with two gigs,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.320]   eight gigs of available space, not a lot. One of these, I think if you're the kind of person that
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.600]   can hack the OS to go into an older machine, you probably don't have an older machine.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.360]   Well, I mean, if you have an older machine, you're probably beyond beyond being convinced that
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.080]   you need a new operating system anyway. It's it's surprising how many machines are at the running
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.880]   10.4. And then when you tell them, well, here's why here's why you can't you can't get onto the
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.400]   Wi-Fi network. Your offering system does not support Wi-Fi. And they get mad. Yeah, Clinton
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.360]   was still in office when this thing was sold. It might be time to go back. There are since the
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.120]   last time you bought a Mac, we have these things called Apple stores. And they're really pretty.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.720]   You're going to dig them a lot. You compare this because Windows is also going through their own
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:26.560]   little revolution for for 2020, 12 with Windows 8. And I keep seeing people seeing sort of boasting
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.720]   about how I tried to install like the the pre release version of it on a Dell latitude from
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.600]   from 10 years ago to works. It runs just works. That's fine. And you keep wondering yourself,
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.240]   you keep asking yourself, what do you have to do to an operating system so that you could still
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.640]   run it on a Pentium on a Pentium processor that's like eight generations on a date.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:53.200]   But still, it's nice that it's works fine on machines that are like three or four or five years old
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.680]   a lot because there's going to be it's a every time that Apple does another incremental release.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.720]   It's not even so much a case of, Hey, if you've got even if you've got a two or three old machine,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.480]   you'll find that it railed around a little bit faster. You'll really love the new drop down menu
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.160]   system. A lot of it is no, they're brand new API set only work with 10.8. And they saw for
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.280]   that you'll be buying for the next two or three years will only will only run on 10.8. If you're
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.840]   still running 10.5, you'll lose access to a large large number of apps, 10.6, 10.7, each one leaves
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.600]   behind another huge swath of the App Store library. So it really is almost an upgrade or dies
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.320]   situation with Apple's attitude towards these annual updates. I want to take a break. When we
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.280]   come back, let's talk about what mountain lion, what's new in mountain lion? How about that?
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.320]   And I do I think that we're going to probably see it the next few weeks. So this is going to be
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.720]   something. And I would guess if you can, if you have compatibility, neither of you have a compelling
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.680]   reason for not upgrading, right? There's no, it's not going to break anything. Well, it's probably
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.000]   it's probably going to break some stuff for the first couple months. I don't very very slowly.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.280]   Usually there's one because you're in production machines. Yeah, I mean, you just,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:05.040]   yeah, very slowly, very slowly. You don't there's no reason to update immediately. Just, you know,
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.760]   just, you know, it's so interesting on the windows side, nobody upgrades you buy in a machine.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.560]   It's very rare that people buy a operating system upgrade on the max side. I don't know what the
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.160]   stats are, but it's like 80 or 90 percent. People just upgrade. Just all I got to say,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.440]   my experience with lion is if you're a, you know, one step ahead, your leader, if you're two
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.160]   steps ahead, you're a martyr. And remember all you have, you don't have to outrun the lion.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.120]   You just have to run the next guy. I just like to watch everyone get, because there's all these
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.880]   bugs. Lion came out and there was all this. Was it really bad? I remember. It was bad.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.600]   And so there was all this stuff that wasn't working. And so we, I kind of let it, we hung out for a
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.960]   little while. And even the very last machine that I got, I talked about it last week,
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.200]   trashed my raid. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Fixed it by going back to mountain lines. And I
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.480]   was back in mountain line. Now I got a big mess. But anyway, so it's, I wouldn't say that I would,
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.200]   I'm not going to upgrade immediately. That's all I got to say. I mean, I'll upgrade one machine,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.720]   so we can talk about it on the show, but the rest of our machines will slowly get upgraded
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.480]   over the next six months. And I, the other hand, will upgrade every machine I have,
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.000]   immediately regardless, heedless of any complaints. Everybody here is like, oh, no, I don't know.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.720]   It'll, it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll work, it'll work great for almost everybody, but there's always
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.440]   going to be that 5% where you have that's this one app that needs to run, but it won't run,
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.840]   or you have this one peripheral that's not even terribly exotic, but the company has fallen a
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.800]   little bit behind in driver technology. And it causes that to fail, which is why it's, it's,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.200]   it's usually smart to least wait a couple weeks just to see if there are any big showstoppers that
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.120]   appear in the news about things that affect a large swath of people, because those can definitely
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:43.120]   happen. But yeah, it's, it's, the, the, I guess the upside is that why do you necessarily need it
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.320]   to have it on the day of release? It's not as though, it's not as though the 103rd caller gets
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.240]   free Aerosmith tickets or something for up between the 103rd person upgrade. It's not a radio.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.880]   You guys have to hand in your cards as pundits.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:01.600]   You if, if it's the reason you know that it's broken is because people like me immediately
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.000]   download it. We hit refresh over one of my computers. I'm going to, I'm going to
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.680]   upgrade immediately, but I need a you're going to do it, right? Because that's your job.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.400]   One computer here in the studio. I got two computers, two max in the living room back in the office.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.480]   I've got three max and I've got my real computer upstairs on the nightstand and the
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.080]   bin, the bedroom because I had to let it go. How many of those are you going to? I got, I got,
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.360]   I'll be upgrade. I'll be upgrading two of those immediately. The last one to go is always that
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.600]   MacBook that I run my entire wife on. If I, if I had like a really huge like book project going on,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.240]   if there was like a really big project that, a contract that's going to be doing like six weeks,
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.280]   and there's no excuses for it not being in on time, it would no, there's no, I wouldn't let
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.240]   a new operating system anywhere near it. Well, I just like living on the bleeding edge.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.640]   Also, you get, you get, you get, it's great, it's great TV. If you have like,
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.600]   it's like me, if this, if this turns into like the, a routine problem on any enterprise chip
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.760]   computer, you know, where it's like, oh, I'm sorry. That, that, that flash drive is in
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.680]   compatible with this port and it results in a shower of sparks and Truman being thrown across
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.440]   the room. That's a great show that you want to have, you want to have paper like that's great.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:19.200]   And then let me check, what is the 24th? That's a Tuesday, right? Yeah, it's, it's two weeks from
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.520]   now. So if it is the, oh, see that'd be the 25th though, if it comes out the day after the
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.960]   analyst call. I don't care. I'm doing, I'm going on air. I'm going to install it live on the air
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.720]   whenever it's available. There's a developer version just installing it. No, no, no, no, no,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.880]   no, see, that's the thing. I don't do the developer version. I like to be surprised.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:44.720]   I, I, that's my whole point is I don't do the developer version, but the minute the consumer
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.080]   version's available, I'm there. As soon as it's released, I even say that people send me, uh, uh,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.480]   uh, you know, prospective email saying, would you like to look at our software for it comes out?
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.600]   I say, no, but the minute it comes out, send it to me and I'll take a look at it. I don't
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   want to see pre-release software because that's not what consumers are using. I want to see the
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   real deal and, but, but I will use it right away. And you know what, you can watch me. And if I'm
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.680]   screaming and yelling, don't do it. It's very simple. That's why I do that. It's my job.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.160]   Here, I'll tell you what, there's no pain. Oh, I'm excited though. There is an upgrade and
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.880]   people have been waiting for Squarespace six for a long time. It's out still in beta, I think,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.760]   but you can do it now. Go to squarespace.com, click the try it free button. I don't,
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.120]   I guess you don't get the choices. Squarespace six yet. I'm confused. I'm confused. My site is
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.440]   on squarespace six. I just think squarespace is so weird. So here's what the deal is. Squarespace
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.600]   is hosting plus software for your website, whether it's a blog, a photo gallery, a portfolio,
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.440]   e-commerce, whatever it is you're doing. And you can see the broad variety of things that people
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.960]   are doing. If you go to the examples page at squarespace.com, I'll tell you, it's a lot of,
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.160]   a lot of artists, a lot of photographers, a lot of people with great aesthetics. Why?
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:56.960]   Our sites are all on it.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.000]   Because it's gorgeous and because no two squarespace sites look alike. And that's really important.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.120]   You know, it's not a cookie cutter thing. They have these great templates.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.440]   I don't even know what I'm looking at. It's the strobeest and numb nuts hobby and McNally.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.680]   Wow, that's cool. They're doing a tour. So they chose squarespace. Look at these guys and some
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:24.080]   of the best photographers out there. So here's the deal. Squarespace.com, click the green try it free
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.560]   button. If you want, look at the examples first, give it, take the tour. They've got a great online
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.840]   tour on the site, build your site, choose your style and then relax. They say, I love that.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.640]   The best hosting, the best designs, 85 plus professionally designed templates,
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:46.560]   some brand new ones too. The CSS editor, if you're an expert, but you don't need to be because
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.120]   it's all point and click. One of the big things for us is that a lot of people on the company
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.840]   can update it. Right. And fix things, change things, add pages, customize, build without having
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.000]   a big developer skills. There's no coding required. Everything's wizzy wiggets.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.600]   But you can have the coder if you have like the person in your company who's really good at that,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.680]   that person can set up and then let the rest of them tweak it. And we have a mixture of all of that
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.760]   between db garage and pixel core with raw squarespace pages. And you can have multiple users on the,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.920]   on the, there's two plans, I'll show you the pricing in a second, but on the full plan,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.280]   you can have as many editors as you want. So you can say, you can do this, there's permissions,
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.680]   you can do this, but you can't do that. Complete importing from your existing
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.400]   blog or a site WordPress blogger, moveable type type pad and exporting out if you want to go back.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:37.760]   Now here's the pricing, $8 a month when you pay for a year is the basic 20 pages, a half a terabyte
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.280]   a month of bandwidth to gigs of storage. That's fine for basic site. That's fine. Although for
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.920]   many people, you're going to want to do the $16 a month. That's when you buy it. I know it's unlimited
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.520]   pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage. If this had been around when we started to it,
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.000]   I wouldn't have worried about bandwidth deals. This is a great deal. And I'm going to make it
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.320]   even better because if you use the offer code, Mac break seven, when you buy it, you don't have
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.120]   to do anything to try it. But if you decide to buy, you'll get 10% off your first purchase,
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   whether it's a month or a year, but 10% off the yearly plan is a significant savings. So I would
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.840]   do it. That's Mac break seven. They also, when you buy a yearly plan, will automatically handle
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.840]   a custom domain name. They hook it all up. You know, sometimes that could be a little fiddly.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.920]   They do it all for you. Squarespace.com. Try it today. I think you'll like it. And if you decide
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.240]   to buy Mac break seven. So new features in Mountain Line, just a quick tour, just because it's been
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.840]   a while since we've looked at this. I'm looking at Apple site iCloud. Well, that's already, that's
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   not new. Well, it's new and it's a big deal for documents. Document. Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.560]   Documents in the cloud, the ability to just walk away from your Mac in your office, pick up your
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.600]   iPad and pick up and I work right where you left off. That's a huge deal. This is this really is
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.320]   the release that is kind of a put up or shut up moment for for iCloud, where we've been kind of
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.280]   forgiving that iCloud is works great and some things doesn't work so great and other things.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.720]   As soon as Mountain Line gets released, that there's a period that begins with the release of
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:19.040]   Mountain Line and probably ends maybe eight weeks after the release of iOS six. That says that if
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.800]   iCloud isn't feature complete and reliable by the end of that, we have to start wondering,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.720]   is this ever going to really work out? But yeah, documents in the cloud is really going to sell
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.080]   the idea of here's why you want to buy it. Here's one of the many reasons why you want to buy an
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:38.480]   iPad and not something else. Yeah. Now that's for I work only or is it? Well, I'm sorry,
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.720]   I misspoke. It's it's any third party app can support iCloud. Okay, I work is almost certainly
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.960]   going to be the first to the first suite of apps that really does that great right out of the box.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:54.080]   A lot of developers are having problems figuring out how to support iCloud properly. It's a it's
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:00.560]   a subtle subtle thing to grasp because you realize that when you think about how iCloud works,
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.960]   it's all about saying that there is a central truth to this piece of data that's being hosted
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.560]   by iCloud. And when there's a discrepancy between two copies of that same document on multiple devices,
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:16.080]   there has to be a battle to figure out which one of the works. And so you you extrapolate that
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:25.200]   into what happens when one my iPad is using a word processor that support let's say version 1.31
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.520]   of this document type. My desktop just got an update that now creates a different slightly
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.280]   different version 1.32 of the for file format. And I have not only two different files,
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:42.080]   but also two different data structures. How do you figure that's that stuff out? Also,
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:48.320]   how do you deal with an app that this will work great? iCloud is absolutely perfect for things
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.480]   like contacts and appointments and notes, little bits of information. But what happens when you have
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:59.200]   like a whole like a file that's actually 300 or 400 megabytes long. You have a report that's
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.600]   just huge monumental or you have a database that's going to be sinking through this sort of way.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.960]   So we have to figure out exactly how well these things are going to work. You mean, we talked about
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   how you get a little bit worried about adopting a new operating system right out of the box on
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.840]   first day. iCloud apps are also going to be that sort of thing where you want to be a little bit
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:25.840]   careful before using the cloud features until you know that this specific developer for this
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   specific product has worked out every single kink it's possible because I've been talked a
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.840]   lot of developers and it's not it's not really a click one button and make iCloud work. It really
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.360]   is a start really really early figure out every single way that this app can screw up with
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.080]   sinking and make sure that you've taken care of those those exceptions.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:50.640]   But implemented properly, this could be huge. Right. Exactly. I mean, it works. I use iCloud all
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.480]   the time on my iPad stuff. But what I'm really looking forward to is the day when I don't have
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:01.200]   to use Dropbox right now. The great that's what this basically replaces.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.240]   Yes. I mean, because drop the Dropbox's strength is that you do have to use your you do have to
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.480]   think about how you use it, but your feel as though you're completely in control of it.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.400]   And it almost never fails. I do have to remember to keep my documents inside my Dropbox folder.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.840]   And then when I want to actually use this pages document in the iOS version of pages,
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:30.640]   I then have to use the Dropbox app in order to get that out of my sink folder and into iWorks
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:38.160]   pages workspace. But it does work. So the idea is that when iCloud is up and working,
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.240]   and I mean, if I'm using pages on the Mac and pages on iOS, I don't have to even do anything.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.840]   The fact that I'm using an iOS, excuse me, an iCloud studly desktop app means that it's
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.240]   available to me everywhere. So no, no intermediate. No, nothing to do, nothing to maintain, nothing to
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.480]   think about. It's just there. And it seems minor compared to that, but also reminders and notes
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.960]   will now be synced to the desktop. Right. And actually, I think that could be very useful.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.400]   I use reminders for my shopping list for I use reminders for a lot of things.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:09.600]   That could be pretty useful on it. But you need to make this work sensibly. It's you need an
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:15.040]   iPhone or you need an iOS device as well. Yeah, obviously, you need to have lots of different
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.560]   devices going. Right. But I mean, you sort of realize you I was sort of motivated to start
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:27.040]   playing back previous keynotes. And you listen to the tone that Apple used to use in the keynotes
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.680]   when talking about iCloud, in which they're really talking about it as though it were the new iPad,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:37.120]   as though it were the new iPhone. And in all the months since then, you come to appreciate that.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.080]   Yeah, Apple truly is investing a lot of their future in iCloud. They feel as though this is
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.720]   the service, this is the glue that even if you even if a user doesn't necessarily know that iCloud
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.320]   exists, it's the reason why they think that the combination of a Macintosh, not Windows,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:57.840]   and an iPad, not an Android tablet, and an iPhone and not a Windows phone machine is the
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.000]   absolute killer triple play combination in tech. Well, it has to be. I mean, you have to,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.720]   I don't know, I think iCloud isn't really a choice. You have to be able to connect to all
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.520]   these devices with this, with this, you know, and it's still not seamless enough, in my opinion.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.000]   I mean, we really want to get rid of, I mean, have to admit we don't. Google Docs drives us a
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.240]   little crazy, but the fact that all of us can work on it together. Well, and that's one thing
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.720]   that iCloud will not be cross-platform, right? I don't care about cross-platform,
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.960]   but I know you do. Well, some people do. All right, maybe nobody in your enterprise uses Windows,
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.680]   but that is something to point out is that Google Docs does go across platform. Right.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.160]   Anybody with a browser. But I have to admit that that's the perfect example of the lowest
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.560]   common denominator. So it's cross-platform and it's just so hard to use. I mean, try building a
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.920]   spreadsheet on Google Docs. Well, that's the price you pay, right? Yeah, because cross-platform
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:51.440]   means you can't be tweaked for the UI. Well, use it all the time. We complain about it all the time.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.840]   We use it all the time because nothing else can use. Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:58.400]   We've been looking for something better. And I think we're all Mac, but I mean, business uses
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.680]   Windows. I guess we have to be cross-platform because some of our hosts, we get this show about
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:10.240]   Windows. I don't know how that happened, but SkyDrive, Microsoft Solution, is a little more
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.960]   cross-platform. There are skydive clients you can sync on a Mac. I wonder if Apple will ever offer
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:22.800]   anything for Windows users. Or just a web way to input web interface.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:30.080]   There's a web way. It's a very serious blog. They can't dive into it.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:37.040]   I'd be surprised if Apple doesn't at least open up an API so that third parties can write Windows
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:44.640]   apps that access documents in the cloud. I don't know how Apple can bank iCloud work that way.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:51.440]   Unless they at least allow even third party Mac OS apps to simply say, "Here's an app that I have
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:57.200]   now built and I'm selling for five bucks of the app store that turns iCloud into that allows me
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.880]   to have a flash drive of sorts, allows me to have a Dropbox folder hosted with an iCloud so that
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.440]   I can move documents into and out of it very, very easily and make them visible to Windows
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:13.600]   people and other people." Dropbox is cross-platform too. I mean, I think maybe in a way Dropbox is
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   the real competition. Especially in iOS, it's almost every app works with the killer B.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.840]   Now they've just definitely just doubled the storage.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.520]   Double storage. Yeah. It's not even 100 megabytes for next to nothing.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.160]   Well, no. Dropbox is expensive. It's not next to nothing. It's 100 bucks a year. Isn't it
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.680]   for 100 megabytes? I can't remember what the pricing is. It's not completely cheap.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:42.080]   And I think, well, it is cheaper than iCloud. What is iCloud storage? It's pretty expensive
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.160]   compared to that. I think it isn't. I'm going to have to look up
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.320]   through Dropbox pricing because we just got doubled. I have 100 gigs of Dropbox.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:57.520]   Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. I said megabytes.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.360]   Oh, oh. I said megabytes.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.920]   Gigabytes. See, the problem is I write so much about this. Especially when I'm running about
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.000]   phones where I'll spend two paragraphs talking about how megapixels the camera is. And then
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.800]   the first line of the next sentence is about storage. And I'm not really that stupid. I'm
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.040]   stupid. I love that stupid. No, you know what you're doing. Let's see. Here's Dropbox pricing.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:24.480]   Let's see. It's $99 a year, $100 a year for 50 gigs, $200 a year for 100 gigs.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.280]   Although they're going to double that right now. Or is that the double? I think that's the double.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.480]   That's the double. And then let's see the pricing for
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:41.040]   storage for iCloud. It's more than that. I'm going to have to look at my iPad. $20 for 10 gigabytes,
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.160]   $40 for 20. It's the same price, $100 for 50. It's the same price as Dropbox.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.040]   So probably not by accident. Probably that's not really nice.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.840]   Notification center. Now, growls got to be a little upset, but I think this is going to be a
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.720]   little more integrated than growl and probably a little bit more useful. It's
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.480]   directly from iOS, which is directly from Android. The idea that something slides in
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.680]   on the right side of your screen, letting you know you've got email, a message,
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.400]   a software update, a calendar alert. It's a center so that other apps can hook into it.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.880]   I like that. I use growl a lot. This seems like it'll be a little bit more
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.120]   integrated than growls. So this will be nice. Oh, it's very growlish.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:32.000]   Power nap. If you have a MacBook Air late model or a retina, when your Mac go to sleep,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.960]   it still gets things done. I don't know if I, I hope that's only when it's plugged in.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.200]   One of the problems that I have is that an iPhone right now is doing a lot of stuff in the
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.840]   background. It says when your Mac is connected to a powered source. Okay. So you're okay.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:53.760]   Updates makes backups with time machine downloads email. And while that updating is going on,
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:28:00.000]   the system sounds are silent and no lights or fans come on. So nothing disturbs you. You know,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.640]   I noticed on the retina, there's no, none of that pulsing light thing. There's no light anymore.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.040]   Not even a battery status light. Nothing. I have to admit that was kind of, it's kind of,
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.560]   I like the important feature for me to know what it's thinking. Well, like when the screen doesn't
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.400]   come on, when it opens up, I want to know whether that light's going right or nothing.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.400]   And that's probably because of power nap. I'm finally gonna get mine. You're gonna get the
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.800]   retina. I got you ordered it, but I got the mail. I ordered it one minute after after they put it on.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.120]   Poor guy, but you got the top of the line BTO built to order. It's
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.520]   dictation. I'm excited about dictation. I use dictation on iOS a lot.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.400]   I use dragon tons. This is right. All right. This is interesting to see how it compares to
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.360]   this nuance. I'm pretty sure they're using another use. I think it's new ones. The question is,
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.840]   are they going to have all the features that dragon has? I mean, you know, that's the question
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.000]   is what's built in dragon has nice correction features. There's a lot of good correction
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.720]   features. There's a lot of tools that you have there where you can tell it to scratch that or,
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.880]   you know, do a variety of different things. And it'll be interesting to see how much of that ends up in
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.800]   the OS version, because I'm going to guess that it's a very, very great basic version of dragon,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.320]   but not the feature dragon. So if you're really using it like I do, you'll still want to use
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.520]   dragon. I would guess that it would be identical to what we have on iOS, which is very basic.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.200]   But gets the job done for most people.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:22.160]   Share from everywhere, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and Vimeo. Anything. This is, this is the iOS
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:29.120]  ification. But not you, but not. I wouldn't worry about it. You do the kids here to Google plus.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:35.600]   Oh, not that I'm bitter. There's a new Google plus client for this. Awesome. Have you seen it?
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.240]   I'm now I'm going to check it. Somebody just mentioned it. Don't talk about it.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:46.080]   Is it coming to your home? You can talk about it. That's the old one. Yeah. I've update.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.720]   No, no, show me. We'll get there. Facebook is integrated in. You can status update from anywhere.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:30:00.880]   Twitter. Airplay. Now, this I like this. I like now. Didn't isn't it? Rogan, Mika, who makes air
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:06.720]   foil, which lets you play any audio. But airplay will actually mirror your video. Anything that's on.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.160]   Oh, this is so cool. You hear it or something like that. That was a game.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:16.640]   So if you have an app, you need the new Apple TV, right? And then I guess you'll just be able to
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.000]   say it's on my screen. Now I want to see on the big screen that is so cool. I've been doing that
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.880]   on the iPad. It's great. And if you're, if you're looking at what you want to put in your conference
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.520]   room. Oh, yeah. That's all I got to say. If you're Mac based, you know, you, you now, I mean,
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.800]   you can have all the little cables and all the little don't have anything else. But you've seen
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.160]   the Samsung ad the dongle. I saw that. I saw that. I'll play that in a second.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:42.400]   See, Samsung has to jump on these features because an iOS 6, all of that stuff's going to be.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.640]   It's like you got a quick advertised fast because it's all going to be there in iOS 6. Anyway,
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.520]   and mountain. Oh, the whole point is it's going to work so much better. I mean, Samsung,
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.680]   I mean, they make they make jillings and jillings of TV sets so they know how to support like
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.800]   existing standards for connecting a wireless lead to TVs and browsing content. But whereas
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.760]   this is truly click this one familiar button that will be everywhere in the interface to
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:11.440]   either use the TV as a second display or mirror. And it simply works. I have to dig and dig and dig
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.600]   through documentation and get it to work on the Samsung Galaxy three three. So it's not just the
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.920]   fact that it does. It's the fact that it's going to do it so well. And I get and then also gave,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.320]   it's also giving me a reason why I think I'm going to have to buy myself another Apple TV to
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:32.240]   travel with as a presentation. Very good point because if it means that I can present from
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.480]   anywhere in the room just by plugging and plugging this directly into the into the projector,
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:41.680]   but also have Apple TV in my hotel room for the week. Yeah, that's that's a good deal for me.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.120]   That's an excellent point. I mean, it's small enough. It'd be easy to carry that around.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:51.520]   And then the only the new Apple TV or either. Well, I don't know. I'm making either. I'll test
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:58.080]   it. I have it's easy to set up with Apple TV. I guess it's any Apple TV. Airplay mirroring
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:05.120]   anything that's on your Mac, except. And I know this is the case on the iPad. And I guess
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:11.600]   I'm guessing it'll be the case on the desktop Hulu HBO go. There's certain there are apps on the
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.040]   iPad that say, sorry, we don't share, but that's the that's the choice of developers. That's not
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.160]   the choice. Right. No, it's not an Apple. No, no, I understand. But Apple did give them that choice.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:28.960]   I guess you have to game center. Do you care? I don't care. Anybody care? No, I know I know I
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:34.240]   know people who care because believe me that they want their high scores to be high frickin scores.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.680]   They want all the equity that they build up, not just their their scores, but also the social
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.280]   connections they've made over the past. Well, that's kind of an issue though, isn't it? Because
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.920]   does it distinguish between desktop Angry Birds and iOS Angry Birds?
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:53.360]   Well, the app can make that choice. It should because if you have a desktop,
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.880]   you get a bigger screen, a better controls. I think it shouldn't be the same.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.240]   It's I mean, gaming is such a big part of what happens during that day.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.560]   When going back to Airplay, I think that there are a million reasons why it's a great idea,
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.920]   but you also have to imagine that it also gives a also gives Mac gaming additional
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.240]   presence inside the living room, the big screen with a good not only the big screen with the great
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.160]   speakers, but the sofa where you can have two or three people sitting and actually
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:26.000]   confirming at the exact same time. All right. Gatekeeper, this is huge. I think this is maybe
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.760]   the most important feature of Mountain Lion, big security update, including something that
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.920]   prevents you from downloading third party apps if you want. You could turn this on for your kids.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:43.520]   This is also for admins at a school or at a corporation and being able to just lock down
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.160]   the machines, which is something they haven't been able to do, which is one of the reasons they
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:51.200]   don't like. So there's three levels of security. You can set it so that only Mac App Store apps
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.960]   are available. That's the highest level of security. The intermediate step is Mac App Store plus
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:03.280]   developers who have signed certificates, meaning that you know who they are,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:10.240]   which presumably somebody doing malware is not going to take the time to get or the highest level.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.320]   And I'm glad they still include this anywhere you want. You can still download from any website.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:20.720]   Doesn't matter. So those are the three different settings. And I think that's good. I think the
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.920]   key is if you're installing it for your parents, you just turn it on. I'm going to turn it on App Store
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.680]   until only. And then you can call me if you need me to install something other than that.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.440]   One of the I'm giving you know, I'm doing this at Mac Manyacruz in November. I'm going to do the
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.120]   lecture on Mountain Lion. I dibs it. And one of the things I'm going to talk a lot about is when
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.960]   it's good to download an app from the App Store. But when you might want to download the app from
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.360]   the website and then what to do if you are downloading from the website, there are apps. You
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.120]   know, Alfred is a good example. I love Alfred. You know, that's the one where it's like,
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.040]   it's the new Quicksilver where you hit a keystroke and you type in the first few letters.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:01.920]   Alfred has to offer a different version on the web than they offer on the App Store. And if you
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:08.320]   want the version of Alfred that has the power pack, which gives you a lot of additional features,
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.680]   you have to down you can't use the App Store version. Whatever it is, Apple won't let you.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.880]   That's probably about sandboxing. Yeah, it probably has to do with sandboxing. So,
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:22.000]   I'll tell you that that brings up. I'm not I want to preface this by saying I'm not worried
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.320]   about Gatekeeper. But over the past couple of years, every time Apple does something that
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:34.240]   fundamentally changes the way that users interact with third party software, particularly anything
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:41.120]   that changes the status of third party software. I at least worry that this could be used as another
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:46.960]   weapon in the next year or two. It's sort of like if on a spaceship when they suddenly, you know,
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.600]   we're being attacked by aliens, we suddenly said, you know what, everybody who doesn't know how to
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.040]   pilot the spaceship and who failed the fitness test, we're not kicking out. No, no, no, no,
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.440]   we want everybody on board the ship. We're just putting you all in the same quarters.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:05.200]   I mean, it's it's it's it's almost with telephone sanitizers. We're going to put you all together.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.880]   We're giving your own space. After the engine so that if we get hit there,
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:16.960]   we're not going to care if we lose you. So in a sense, Gatekeeper is a way to easily segregate
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.720]   all the apps that Apple doesn't have control over into one little bundle. And so again,
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.320]   I'm not saying this is any plan. I'm not saying that I'm actively worried about this, but I'm aware
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:32.160]   that suddenly there is a very, very easy fine grained way for Apple to decide. Give me a list of
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.200]   every app on this on this device that we don't have any control over and let us treat this
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.800]   differently or not support it in a future release. So it makes me it right makes I agree with you.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.720]   And you know, I'm the one who said when they started the app store, uh oh. And so for instance,
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.880]   open source software, you can't offer demo versions. There's all sorts of limitations that the
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:58.000]   app store prohibits, not just security. Right. Well, and we've talked about this before now.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.560]   Now we're in a position where if anybody wants any developer who wants to use put these 10.8
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.000]   features inside their apps. Now you can't do that outside the app store. You have to
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.560]   Apple will not allow access to those APIs to to apps that are not available inside the app store,
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:18.640]   which now means that every every app that wants to use that wants to use AirPlay has to be sandboxed
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:25.040]   and has to conform to all these new restrictions. We've talked about this before, but it's maybe a
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.400]   bad idea to be overly trusting of any company, at least be aware that anything that's a great idea
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:36.320]   in 2012 might turn out to be an awful idea in 2013 or 2014. Well, I mean, I definitely worry
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.520]   that there are certain apps that I want to use that aren't going to be available, you know,
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.960]   or are going to be less available there. I think one of the other sides though is that as Apple
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.720]   transitions from being a fringe company with a fringe operating system to a mainstream company
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.400]   with a mainstream operating system, I think that they are kind of taking a different approach to
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:59.200]   security because they're becoming targets. We just saw this last one where we saw a Trojan
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.640]   horse get into the, you know, so the thing is they're now they're no longer off on the bridges.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.000]   We're just targeting them. And so they're, and I think this is a much more heavy-handed way to
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.240]   do it than Microsoft did, but I think that, but it's a great, what's a great idea? I mean,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:18.000]   it's a, people, it's people can joke about how Apple users might think, oh, they don't, they don't
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.760]   care about having control over their machines. I think it's more of a case where they make a
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.800]   conscious choice where we give up certain fine-grained control over what happens on our machines,
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.440]   but the result is almost always, not always, but almost always a much more reliable and a much
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:37.360]   more consistent experience. I use, I've spent this, this, at the top of the show, I, you know,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.880]   gloated about how different Macs I've got running. I also have, you know, two or three different
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.440]   Windows machines, so I build for projects and also just so I can test things out on. And every
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.000]   single, I, the hair stands up of a back of my neck every time I sit down in front of these Windows
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.040]   machines. And if the thought occurs to me that if I'm on Twitter, Twitter client on a Windows
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:00.400]   machine, and I see that, oh, there's a, there's an offer for, wow, this is really great gold box,
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:07.360]   a gold box deal on a memory card that should buy that. So don't buy anything through a Windows
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.600]   machine that you've had running for more than three hours and it's connected to the Internet.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:17.120]   There's probably a key logger on it. And it's, it's a testimony to how Apple runs their systems
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:22.240]   that I have that absolute faith that my, my Mac is not, doesn't have anything malicious installed
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.480]   on it. And so for that basis, gig people are certainly a good trade for just about everybody.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.640]   We should mention, you know, that a lot of attention to that DNS changer malware that didn't break
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   the Internet yesterday. This, somebody told me that on CNN, they actually said there's a new
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:41.840]   virus called DNS changer. It's going to shut the Internet down on Monday. It's like, no,
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:47.200]   that's not exactly right. But, yeah, but it was, it did. Now I said mistakenly, oh, you don't have
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.880]   to worry if you're in a Mac, but actually, I mean, you really don't have to worry. But there was a
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:57.040]   DNS changer attempt on the Mac, which you had to, you know, like really work hard to get it on your
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.200]   system. Well, actually, it did affect the Mac in that one of the things that some of these variants
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.920]   did was actually change the settings on your router. So every device you're using would be
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:12.800]   going through these, these, these bogus DNS. But there was a DMG file called QuickTimeUpdate.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.680]   This was a couple years back that if you really were dumb and your friends said, here,
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:23.360]   have a QuickTime update. It's on me and you did it, then you might, you know. Anyway,
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.000]   apparently that wasn't a big deal. Most people had gotten the message that, yeah, thank goodness.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.080]   So, look, any step that any company, Windows, Microsoft or Apple makes towards making its
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:39.360]   operating system more locked down is a good thing. Yeah. And giving people the choice to say,
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:46.160]   mom and dad, you could only use the app store. It's a good thing. Yes. Yeah. No, that's part of
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.120]   that. That's part of what makes Apple great. And part of the reason why they can actually do
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.760]   the stuff is because they're not willing to let the PowerPC 601 chips. Right. It's okay to say,
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.720]   the power computing machine that you bought 10 years ago, we're okay with you not being an
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.320]   Apple customer anymore if you can't afford it. But if you can't get yourself a new Mac.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.880]   And they're doing some pretty sophisticated stuff like address space layout randomization,
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:16.480]   which moves memory locations around. So, you know, one of the common attacks is to change
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.720]   data space, put code in data space and then jump to it and execute it. But that only works
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.320]   if everything's in the same place all the time. If you move it around, it makes it much more
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:29.920]   difficult. That's in the kernel as it should be. And Microsoft's doing that as well in Windows.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.440]   The unique developer ID so you could digitally sign apps I think is great. Although,
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.000]   you know, I mean, there'll probably be a hack around that at some point. I don't know.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.640]   Sandblock boxing, which is very controversial with developers, you know, our friend Daniel
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.480]   Jalka of Red Mountain software is not, you know, Red sweater software is not
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:57.440]   sweater, not thrilled about it. Well, the large problem is that Apple, I think that they'd make a
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.600]   lot of developers happy if they made it a blanket rule that our own apps have to follow the exact
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:08.160]   same rules. Sorry, our own consumer apps have to follow the exact same rules where if we're going
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.880]   to sell iPhoto, if we're going to sell Aperture, if we're going to sell GarageBand as an extra
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.280]   product or pages, anything that a third party developer might have to compete with and pages has
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.240]   to be fully sandboxed. Aperture has to follow every single rule that we inflict on other people.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.920]   If nothing else, it would force their own in-house developers and their contractors to understand
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.160]   exactly the problems that they're facing. The fact that their extent from their own rules is what
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.080]   costs a lot of the old well out there in the developer's space. Good privacy controls, by the
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:41.840]   way, system preferences contains privacy controls for location sharing, diagnostic information
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.800]   sharing. You know, you're always asked in the past, you've always been asked, but now you could
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:51.120]   turn it off and on in the system preference paints. Safari will now have a do not track setting.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:56.400]   Did they start that yet or is that not available yet? I think that, well, anyway, they're saying
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.160]   this is going to be in Mountain Line. And you finally search in the browser and you can search in
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.560]   the... And a unified browser? Oh, God, that's the one thing that I... I used Safari on the Mac,
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:13.120]   only because for some reason on my Mac's Chrome seems to be very slow, but it's so hard to open
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.360]   the app. So you have to command T and then tab so that you go to the search.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.560]   Yeah, you can so use the Chrome. There's... Yeah.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.640]   But there's... I don't want to get rat-holed. So I got a... Okay, so... Okay, we're going to push a
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.960]   couple of things on the stack. The malware in the App Store, push that on the stack,
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:40.720]   and then we were talking about privacy and I've forgotten. See, this is... My stack is screwed up.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:48.000]   And then I want to talk about there's a developer movement of foot to make Chrome
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.720]   the default browser seems as possible. If apps support it, push that on the stack, would you?
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:59.120]   Yes. Who wants to be my stack? When I say pop, you tell me what to talk about, okay? And there's
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.720]   one other thing with privacy. I just... Oh, you just write it down. That's no fair. I got it
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.520]   pretty down somewhere. I don't... My brain. I'm an old man. I can't remember this.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:12.000]   It's so funny that they're now saying search smart. Now there's one field for both web addresses
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.880]   and search terms. Wow, the last browser to actually do that. And then finally, all new features for
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:24.160]   China, which is important if you're in China. Pop, push this on the stack. China gets the iPad.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.840]   Okay. I think we're done with Mountain Line. Anything else to say anybody?
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.960]   I think we need to move on. Or can I stop? Now, wait a minute. Somebody's overwritten my stack
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:42.560]   with malicious code. Damn you. What about this EP thing? Huh? The city of San Francisco is just
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:48.480]   announced. Sorry, we're not going to buy any more Macintosh computers. So Apple has pulled out
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.880]   of the EP certification. This is something they did with the EPA and other electronics manufacturers.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.000]   They were response. They were partly responsible for the standard. Many Apple devices like the one
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:06.240]   in front of me were EP certified. For two things EP is recyclability and energy efficiency. Kind
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:11.920]   of like the energy star rating. And it's... And Apple's just decided we're done. We're not going
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.320]   to get our stuff certified anymore. That means, for instance, the federal government is required
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:25.760]   is by 95% of its new computers have to be EP. Many companies like Kaiser Permanente, HSBC,
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:33.600]   have to buy EP hardware. Ford. So that means these companies will not be buying Macs anymore.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.840]   The question is though, is that the... I think the game... The gamesmanship that may be playing
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.640]   here is whether some of those organizations will change some of their standards based on that.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   I think they shouldn't. I think Apple's saying...
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.560]   I think Apple's saying they should. But I'm saying... We don't want to make recyclable computers anymore.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.840]   Hey, I bought it. You bought it. That retina display. It can't be recycled because it's all glued into one big lump.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:59.040]   And recyclers don't have the time or the tools to unglue the batteries to recycle them properly,
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.720]   to unglue the screen to recycle it properly. That's the problem with the iPad and the iPhone,
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.440]   which never were EP certified. And I think that this is Apple saying, well,
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.600]   we want to sell cool stuff and we don't really care so much if it's recyclable.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:17.520]   I just think that there's going to be a certain number of those organizations that the IT guys
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.320]   may not want to do that. But I think that there are going to be people who are just kind of like,
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:25.280]   well, we want to have Macs running on the system because of a whole bunch of other issues.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:30.080]   Well, believe me, I understand that. But don't you think there's a larger issue here,
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.920]   which is that Apple's moving away from these green standards?
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:44.080]   I think that always that the green standards is not at the top three of their list of priorities.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.840]   They would never let it they tout it like it is. Well, they spend a lot of time.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:53.760]   I don't think there's a reason why when they talk about a new iPad, the first thing they talk
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:58.400]   about is the design. The second thing they talk about is the user experience. And at the end of
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.320]   the presentation, you know, before they bring out Tony Bennett, that's when they say, oh,
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:07.760]   we decided that we're not going to use mercury and lead coated paint. We decided that maybe we'll
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:12.080]   use vegetable thighs instead of that. Well, I mean, I think that in North Carolina,
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.600]   you know, I'm just reading why all these companies are building like Facebook and Apple are building
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.440]   their servers in North Carolina. The main reason is because it's very cheap electricity because
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:27.600]   61% coal. I mean, I understand we as consumers, I bought the damn thing, our demanding thinner,
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:35.840]   lighter, better, you know, but I just feel like I feel like if I said, if I said, oh, this is
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.480]   horrible, I just bought one. I know, you know, it's kind of like I made my choice. I mean, you
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.400]   know, and I think that that's the problem is that it's hard for me to say that they shouldn't,
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.920]   they should they should be stuck with that when I as a consumer made a choice to buy it anyway,
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.960]   you know, and knowing that it wasn't recyclable. We talked about it.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:58.560]   We're bad too, but I'm just saying Apple should be better than we are. Well, no, it's, it's, it's,
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.920]   it's how important is it? I mean, there are there are things that make computers go that are bad
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.280]   for the environment. They're also really bad to pull out of the earth and they're also really
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.800]   bad for the people who have to work with them uses the batteries as an example, lithium-ion
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.000]   battery suit. Right. And and and there but there are also reasons why we're not using Soviet-style,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.880]   you know, vacuum tubes and hand cranks to hand crank diamond, dynamos get things working.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:25.440]   If we want modern electronics, we have to sort of accept that these things that the this is the
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.760]   this is the world that we live in. We can mitigate that. We can all we can it's important to always
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.480]   be concerned about that. But it's difficult to say that I want to I'm going to have a I'm going to
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.720]   have a computer that's only made out of recycled wood pulp at all times. Right.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.880]   I'm good. It's there was a car called the Trabant that was made out of recycled cotton with all the
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.680]   body panels. It was not a great car. Great. Great for the environment. It doesn't mean you can't make a
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:53.840]   great computer that is reset. It's fully recyclable or does it? Well, it's it's if you want to make
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:57.600]   fracture it the way that you want to. If you're if you're as manufacturing designer into a
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:02.960]   disaster is yes. And so it's also the reason why as much as I really really want there to be more
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:09.360]   user accessibility to Apple products, there is a practical limit to how many how user repairable
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:13.520]   you can make a device if you really want to put the the memory modules in a place where the user
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.000]   can get them that limits the size and the shape and even sometimes the performance of the device
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.680]   that you're building. So you can still regret it. You can still mourn it. You can still say I hope
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.840]   that future devices are better to repair. But you also have to acknowledge that sometimes it's not
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:32.080]   entitled if the priority of a user repairability is not in the top five. It's easily knocked out
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:38.080]   by design performance and economics. Clearly. Clearly. I mean, I what I'm saying is I don't I
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.800]   don't think that Apple is being hypocrites. I don't think they're being callous and incorrect
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.560]   by simply saying that we don't we can't build machines that conform to these guidelines. So we
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.000]   just gonna have to accept that some people are not gonna be able to get them. I do think that
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.120]   it's just a case of the price of accepting some of these guidelines is too high for the goals that
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.520]   Apple has for itself and for its consumers. I'm just a self-flowing gadget hand.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:05.760]   Enjoy. Is that is that sweater made out of hemp? And did you spin the will yourself? It's
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:12.160]   completely recyclable. Exactly. And I'm wearing plastic shoes made for fine virgin oil.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.720]   Oh, you were you were in two liter Coke bottles and cut out shoelaces on because
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.800]   why throw them out when Ed Begley Jr says you can make wonderful shoes out of Mr. Pib bottles.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:25.280]   What do you think about this server bug that I felt bad for Marco Armand of Instapaper,
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.080]   a couple of other developers where they pushed updates and there was apparently Apple
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:36.160]   put some DRM on there that was buggy and crash the updates. I think Apple always puts the
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.840]   DRM on it. What is Apple? What does that DRM? What does Apple do? Well, I believe that's the whole
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.440]   system of it's it knowing who you are. And this is your key. You know, like when you're down,
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:49.840]   so it's modified the update by sticking your address in there and who you are. My understanding
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:54.320]   of it is is that you're, you know, as a developer, you don't have to worry about the
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.520]   security, which is awesome. I mean, just just make sure it's clear. It's awesome that as a
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.720]   developer, you don't have to worry about the security that Apple will worry about that for you at a
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.480]   system level. That's true. When you're doing it with the app store, it makes it much easier for
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.080]   them to keep it updated, keep it moving, but they're constantly updating it. They're constantly
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.160]   improving it. And what they did here. And so what happens is they take your code, they inject
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:19.120]   the DRM into it. And then they and then that's when someone buys it. And then that means that
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:24.240]   when you download it, that version, that download is customized to your computer. It's like, it's
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:29.200]   like, you have to say that as DRM goes, it's very non-onerous. I mean, you basically, when you buy
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.040]   something on the app store, you get to run it on any computer. I mean, what there's technically
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.960]   a limit, but I mean, I have an, I gotta say is I got a new computer coming and all I'm going to
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.480]   have to do except for the pro apps that I have, that's what I did. I'm literally going to hit,
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.920]   well, install into the pro apps now. I mean, logic, final cut, all the motion, all the Apple
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.520]   stuff will be easy. And then with with Adobe and Autodesk and everything else, I'll be like,
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.160]   it was really a nice thing. I just went, yeah, put them all on there.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.000]   You got to admit that that makes it really hard to buy stuff outside of the app store.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.280]   If it's not, if it's not something that's very specialized, if it's not a like Photoshop or
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   something like that, that you have to have, I have to have anyway. The,
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:10.000]   I was really pleased. We had purchased Logic. My son uses it for composing. And I had purchased
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.480]   the box version of it, but as soon as I, but he needed, he got, I was letting in my air for the,
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:20.080]   he's in Berkeley College of Music this week. And I let in my air, logic's not on it. It
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.720]   doesn't have a disk drive. I would have to find the disk, get the, I said, just buy it on the app
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.680]   store. And then you have it forever. We have it forever. You know, yeah, wasting money,
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.280]   but it's so convenient. I have stuff that I, that I bought previously that I bought on the
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   app store specifically because it was something that I could, that I knew that I'd be able to just
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:41.760]   constantly upgrade. It was all part of the system. Right. You know, it was just, it's cool.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:47.520]   So the server that was generating the code, in other words, sticking in whatever it sticks in,
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:52.560]   probably your email address. And it has to be some code because it's based on you.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.880]   So that it knows that it's your app. Yeah, because you can't give the file to somebody else. They
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:01.600]   can't use it. It's authorized only for you. So Apple said the bug affected only a small number
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:07.520]   of users. The issue has been rectified. I never liked that word. I don't know. And we don't expect
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:14.960]   to occur again. It will never happen again. Good reader and the InstaPaper at least had the problem.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:23.840]   So let's pop, pop the stack. iOS malware hits the app store. The first, it was the Russian program,
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:31.440]   which is also on Android. So just don't feel so smug, Android. It's called find and call. It was
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.880]   available in the Google Play Store, Russian version of the store, as well as the Apple App Store,
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:39.360]   secretly harvesting data from users address books, sending the information to developers
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:44.880]   servers, and then spamming you with tests and SMS. If you've gotten any SMS spam lately,
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:49.840]   check and see if you have that app. It was advertising itself as a tool for aggregating
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:56.880]   and simplifying contacts. Kaspersky Labs says, well, this is what it's doing. Now,
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:04.240]   I guess the problem is Apple implies that, you know, one of the reasons that app store is safer
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.560]   is we check everything. But there's so many apps being submitted every day. They can't possibly
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.600]   thoroughly check everything. This is an example of stuff does sneak by, right?
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.680]   Yeah, I think that's... So is it a false sense of security we have?
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:19.040]   I think you always have to be careful about what you're doing. I think that it's all...
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.560]   And I got it from the app store. It's much safer than the app store than it is on a website.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.000]   I mean, you know, because the website's not going to, you know, it's even after it's been found,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   there's no chance that, you know, there's another chance that it's going to pop up somewhere else,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.840]   or it could be even on the same website and it could stay there for years or months, and this
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.160]   was found out and taken down. The author of the app says, spamming feature bug,
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.640]   we are in process of fixing bug.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.840]   Yeah, you know, one program got detected.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.360]   And it's being removed.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:51.280]   It's been squirreled, because we will have no version of the Doodle Buds.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:51.840]   Well, but...
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:57.760]   That will harvest all of the app store IDs without ever being detected, don't we?
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.960]   I mean, the one thing you know is that, is that after this happens, the one thing you know is that
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:06.000]   from that developer will probably have zero chance of getting anything into the app store.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.960]   He ain't getting a certificate.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.800]   You know, they're going to have to find somebody else to submit them.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.920]   They're going to have to reincorporate.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.400]   They're going to have to...
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.600]   You know, there's going to be a whole lot of things that happen on the other side of that.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.560]   I think that's probably the warning for many.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:21.680]   And you're right. It's safer, but don't have the false sense of security.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:25.360]   And that's why you need things like Gatekeeper to make it even better.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.240]   And actually, it's not Gatekeeper so much.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.240]   It's this new sandboxing, because you have to, as a developer, say,
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.200]   well, as among other things, I need to access you to a content list.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:40.720]   And it says that in the manifest and then you have to ask permission, etc, etc, etc.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:45.360]   Yeah. So it's all being done with user interaction, especially on the Mac OS side.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.720]   It can't even do something as...
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:53.120]   It can't even do anything as simple as if part of this word processor's core functionality is
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.280]   that it shares files via Dropbox.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.360]   It can't look for the Dropbox folder where it expects it to be an automatically connect to it,
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.760]   has to ask you to find it, please, for it and point to it, for it to start working.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:15.360]   7.85-inch iPad to ramp up production in September, Foxconn, Brazil, available in October.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:24.400]   Do we believe this? You said, Andy, and I love this, that Apple is not aware of the competition,
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:30.640]   doesn't make stuff because of the competition, doesn't react to competition.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:36.400]   This would seem to be a reactive device responding to the Kindle Fire and the Google Nexus 7.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:42.080]   Well, I think that my review of the Nexus 7 is coming out tomorrow.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.200]   Lots of cool stuff.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.080]   It's awesome, isn't it?
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.120]   The more I played with it, I thought I was going to be ready with it on Friday,
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:52.160]   but then I started playing with it as a tablet as opposed to a media device, and it's great stuff.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:55.360]   The only negative on that, I think, is the screen brightness is a little dim,
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.720]   but other than that, I'm very impressed.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.480]   Exactly. Screen brightness is a little demo.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.120]   I had a couple of extra specific features that could really bring it up into a different class
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.480]   device, but really nice thing.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.000]   For 200 bucks, that's the point.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:14.640]   I won't get this into a 10-minute thing about this device, but this is an Asus device,
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:23.040]   and every time that I get a laptop or any product from Asus, and I think, oh, this is a $750
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:29.600]   ultra-book set. No, it's a $430 netbook set. Oh, yeah. But it's built so well, it doesn't look like crap.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.200]   It's fast-coupling. It's responsible. It doesn't.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:37.280]   So is Apple responding to this? Are they saying, look, I don't think they're necessarily responding
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:42.320]   to other devices. What they would do is they would respond to the fact that people are reacting
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.960]   well to these devices. I think that they could always do a good job with a 7-inch tablet,
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.360]   but they're not really convinced that people actually want them.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:56.240]   And when you have a device like this that actually sells well, then this is a good vote that says
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.840]   that this is something that people actually want to do. I'm not naive enough to think that Apple
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:06.000]   doesn't--is it willing to protect their supremacy in the tablet market? But I also believe that
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   Apple is the very last company that would rush out a product that it didn't intend to make
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.080]   just because they feel as though there's going to be competition in that space.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.520]   So when Steve Jobs interrupted that analyst call a couple of years ago and said,
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.400]   "Yeah, why would never make this? This is terrible."
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.080]   Disinformation or did he really mean it at the time?
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:29.600]   Well, the famous line I think came actually during the iPad unveil, which is that we looked at
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:34.160]   7-inch tablets and a 7-inch tablet. We should ship with sandpaper, some people can file down
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:40.240]   their fingertips to actually operate it. And that joins so many other great Steve Jobs quotes about
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:46.080]   how people don't want to watch movies on iPads and people don't like ebooks. It's on the getting
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:52.480]   away from Steve Jobs. The Apple philosophy has always been it's not that a 7-inch tablet is a bad
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.840]   idea. It's just that people--other companies have made bad 7-inch tablets by simply not thinking
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:03.200]   it through. So if Apple did make a 7-inch tablet, they would think it through. That's why when I
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:10.160]   talk about this to other people, the big matter of debate is how would they change the iPad to make
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:15.120]   a good 7-inch version of it? I've heard other people speculate about how, well, it'd be easy to--
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:19.920]   there'd be more than enough screen resolution to just simply scale down existing iPad 1 and iPad 2
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:24.480]   apps. And I think that's the last thing that they would do. That is the sand down your fingertip
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.360]   problem to actually make sure you can target all the buttons and things properly. I think that they
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:34.560]   would--I think that they would do a large scale iPod touch and have a different form factor and
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:39.920]   have other--a new class of apps that would take advantage of it. Grouber had an interesting post.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:45.360]   I think he was quoting somebody else, but he said, "You know, if you do a screenshot of the--"
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:51.040]   because it's going to be 1024 by 768. We're pretty much sure of this. As sure as we are of any of this
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:57.680]   stuff. On a 7.85, if you do a screenshot on the existing iPad and then you turn it sideways,
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:03.760]   what happens? Can you get the over-the-shoulder on this? Is this is roughly what a 7-inch iPad would
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:11.520]   be? And those are not too small to use. This is roughly the form factor. It makes it a little taller.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:18.320]   So that's what--you know, sand your fingers. I have big, fat fingers. I think this is usable.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.000]   I could see tapping these. I mean, we use--here's the thing is when we talk about using it. We're using
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.800]   a phone. We're using the phone, right? Exactly. The phone is smaller than that. And we don't have any
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.800]   problem with that. In fact, I'd rather type on the phone than type on my iPad. I mean, I'm faster
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:35.200]   on the phone than I am on my iPad. But do we--are the targets the same size or the buttons the same size?
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:41.280]   No, they're bigger. Yeah. See? I mean, that's the question. Do you scale the buttons up or use on the--I
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:47.360]   think to be more precise, the size of the buttons--the size of the screen can change, but the size of
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.800]   the buttons cannot change. If the size of a button is a certain proportion relative to the size of my
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.920]   fingertip, that has to be the same size on a retina iPad that has to be the same size on an iPhone
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.760]   and that would have to be the same size on a 7-inch iPad. So I'm--I certainly wouldn't put it past
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:09.200]   Apple to just as with the first iPad, they allowed existing iPhone apps to run a double
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.600]   resolution. I wouldn't put it past them to simply say that if you haven't--if you--this will run
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:19.840]   non-optimized apps at one-to-one scale. However, we're--however in three or four months time,
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.280]   the exact same thing would happen with the 7-inch iPad that would happen with the iPad where
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.080]   almost every app developer that is interested in supporting this device would come out with
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.640]   their own custom version that takes advantage of that screen size as opposed to simply allowing
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.040]   people to have what might be a substandard experience with a scaled-down version of this
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:47.920]   with smaller targets on a 7-inch. Trojan kitten has sent me a--an image that has--Oh, so adorable,
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:54.160]   come on into the fourth Trojan kitten. So the--the key point on this is it would be a four,
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.480]   three ratio and everything else including the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7 are 16 by 9 or 16 by 10.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.160]   So it's 40% larger because of this larger, you know, this different
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:13.840]   aspect ratio, although it's still half the size of a traditional iPad.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.800]   Well, half the area, right? I mean, half the area.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.720]   Yes, yes, yes, yes. And that is a huge difference. This--if this is--this is something that really
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.920]   hit me with the Kindle Fire and has only been underscored with the Nexus 7 that this is such a
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   different experience than a 10-inch--10-inch iPad. As small--as small and compacted light as the
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.960]   10-inch iPad is, the difference between something that you can easily hold in one hand and you never
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.800]   tire out, that you can easily slip in any pocket that you have. It really makes it a more intimate
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.840]   device and makes it a more useful device. That--not--doesn't make it a better device, but it's a
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.280]   different experience. And I would be very curious to see what Apple would do with iOS on a larger--in
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.640]   a larger screen size that could be actually toted around a little bit better.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.600]   I think I'd actually prefer a 7-inch over the current version.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.240]   I like--when I had the Galaxy 7 a year ago, I thought, "This is actually not bad. This is good."
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.040]   And the fire I liked, and now this Nexus 7 is great.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.000]   I find that the--
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:10.800]   It's not a horrible size.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.280]   I use my iPhone a lot more than my iPad. Yeah.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.720]   And I find the part of its portability.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.040]   Portability?
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.880]   It's just that it's--I have to think about--I still have to think about a little bit about whether
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.000]   I'm going to take it with me or not. I don't feel like I can just throw it in one of my cargo
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.200]   pockets or something like that. And so that--some of my cargo pockets--
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.240]   And then 1.37 says, "That's exactly the way he likes the playbook."
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.000]   It's just the never--you know, I have--
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.280]   See, well, that's why I've been having an interesting experience with the Nexus 7,
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.720]   because I'm now at the point where I'm trying to use it as a tablet as much as possible.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.320]   And so it works with Bluetooth, so I've got it inside a keyboard.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.560]   I've got that same really cool keyboard case for the Apple Wireless keyboard.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.800]   I'm using it with this. By the way, all the iPad function keys
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.840]   off of any Bluetooth iPad keyboard mapped directly to the appropriate functions on this
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.520]   too, I discovered. But that's beside the point. And I find that I can easily work with Google Docs
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:05.680]   or a simple text-based text editor with this. The difference that I explained in the review is that
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:12.400]   there are two major roles that I view where I use the iPad as a notebook. One is where I just
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.880]   want to leave the house and just work for two or three hours at the coffee shop and just get out
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.880]   of the house for a little bit. And for that, this 7-inch screen works just fine.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.240]   Then there's the other where--Cenera, where I'm leaving the house for two or three days,
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.680]   and I want to use this as a replacement for a notebook, and this just doesn't work at all.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.760]   But in terms of running out of the house and having a computing device that I could use to
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:37.840]   edit documents on, this works pretty darn well. I could only assume that an iOS device work even
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:43.280]   better, but I was surprised at how useful this is. And it's all because Android decided not to
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:48.160]   disable features that are built into Android and built into the hardware that might not make
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.720]   exclusive sense for a device that will primarily be used as an ebook reader. The fact that they
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:59.600]   included full Bluetooth support adds a hell of a lot of value to this $199 device.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:04.080]   Well, and I think that from a business perspective, I mean beyond the technology of it, I think that
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:09.840]   Apple has a long history of closing up the gap. They start high and then they just slowly add
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:15.040]   more iterations, whether it's the iPod Nano and the iPod Shuffle. The idea is they're going to keep
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.600]   on giving you an opportunity to buy one of their products, buy into the ecosystem at a variety of
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.560]   different price points. I think that when you look at schools, I mean, I think we're building
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:29.840]   the whole education system in Rwanda based on the iPad. Really? Wow. I mean, like the whole school
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.960]   one's going to go on. Why not something cheaper? Because it's the cost of development. The iBook
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.840]   author is what we're building on. And so, well, you know, this is why I thought iBook author was
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.680]   important. There you go. It's lock in into that ecosystem. So you're going to buy a $300
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.920]   more expensive tablet because you've got the software on it. Exactly. The software is free. We
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.040]   can build the stuff out. We can build it fast. We can build it easy. We can have the students
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.480]   building it. We can have the teachers building it. You know, the thing is, is that the iPod,
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:00.240]   iPod, I mean, the iBook author is the Trojan horse. I mean, it is the if schools as soon as they buy
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.840]   into another platform without that development tool, they're screwed. You know, because now
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:10.560]   they have to buy from some service, they have to do something, but they're not going to be able
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.760]   to develop their own content as easily and quickly. And so, because you can have, like you can
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:20.880]   imagine schools, instead of having to write a paper, what if you had to build an iBook that is
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.240]   the exam, teaching the other students what you learned about whatever, civil war. And so the
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:30.560]   point is, is that, you know, and having that as a free application is a big deal. So that's why
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:39.680]   we chose to do that. But I can see a $199 version with iBook author as a frontal attack on the OLPC.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.360]   You know, because now you're talking about a price point at $199. I mean, I think $199 is the
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.640]   number. I think that if they go, you know, if they go to, I don't know if they can. They'll match
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.840]   the, if they hit $199, it's gorgeous. Google or ASIS says it's not making money on these.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:07:00.400]   I don't think, I just think that I think that a smaller Apple has a, still has a level of scale,
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.280]   but I think everyone else does it. I mean, they buy, you know, I think you talked about on Twitch,
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:08.960]   they bought all the aluminum. I made that up, but I mean, they kind of like it. They bought
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.800]   everything. I've talked to people who can't build their, their hardware because Apple bought
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.200]   all the chips in the world. Some little one penny chip that they bought all of them, you know,
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.880]   and so, you know, and they bought the future of them, you know, like they bought it.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.160]   I don't think you listen to it. Thank you. That's why I do it now. I'm cleaning my house,
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:33.920]   listen to it. So anyway, the, anyway, the, but I think that I think from a business perspective,
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.760]   I think of Apple, I think Apple is sensitive to the idea of leaving too much space out. I think
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.120]   the mistake that they made with the iPhone, I don't know if they had any other choice,
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.760]   was by not allowing it on Verizon and Sprint and all these other ones early on, they left this
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:51.600]   massive gap that, that now Android, you know, owns. And Android is a larger operating system than,
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.960]   than iOS. I don't know if it's profitable, but it's, it's a larger one. And the, I don't think
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.440]   that they plan to repeat that in the tablet space. So I think that, you know, lowering that price,
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.040]   getting a price point at $199, I think would make an enormous amount of it. If they can do it,
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:09.680]   if they can do it, $249 will help, $249 will help more. But I think they hit $199 and it makes it
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.800]   almost impossible to build a tablet in this space. But just, it's just, it would be almost
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:20.320]   impossible to survive trying to build a tablet. And that would be it. Amazing.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.560]   I mean, I think, and I think even if they sold it at almost no margin, which is not an Apple thing
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:31.360]   to do, I think denying the space, I think has a lot of opportunity for Apple down the road.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:35.760]   Yeah, because if people, the, the most room to compete with Apple has always been to build
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.360]   things that Apple doesn't want to build. Witness all these really cool Android phones that have
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.800]   great features that that was no interest in. So if Apple were to put in, put their own like
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.800]   pocketable tablet, it would then become which one has a better operating system,
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:52.080]   which one has better apps and there it's absolutely no contest, is it?
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.720]   Right. And, and Lone Frog, by the way, on the, on the IRCs said that, you know, the
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.160]   iBook author is not magic, Google or someone else could develop it. And they should.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:05.200]   Yeah, why haven't they? It's been a while now. But the warning now is if they don't,
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.920]   eventually, you know, if, you know, it's going to become a standard, you know, for, for not just,
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:14.160]   I don't know about that, but we'll see. I mean, you know, it's, it's just that it's so hard to develop.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:18.480]   When you, it's amazing what it can do. I don't see people going, oh, yeah. I mean,
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.040]   is there a huge ecosystem of people are getting their head around it?
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.480]   Or is it takes a while? I mean, you know, this is a, this is a new thing to kind of start figuring
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:28.480]   out. But I think I'll, I don't think everybody, most people are as good as you guys at taking
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.160]   these technologies. It's keynote. Like, if you know how to use keynote, like, you can build a book.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.600]   I mean, that's the crazy thing. So, so it sounds like we're all in agreement.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.400]   Apple's going to do a seven and a 0.85 inch tablet. It's going to be out this fall. And it's
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:47.200]   going to be $200. There you go. You heard it here first. For eight. By the way, the UK,
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:53.360]   UK judge Colin Bierce has said, go ahead, you could sell the Galaxy tab. They don't imitate the
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:10:00.640]   iPad because Samsung isn't cool enough. So, I'm not sure if this was a win or a lose by Samsung.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:06.480]   I mean, yeah, they won the case and they got backhanded by the judge in a way that that's all the
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.880]   pressure. He said you can't block the Galaxy tab 10 because Apple, it doesn't violate Apple's
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.200]   registered design because Samsung's not cool enough and do not have the same understated and
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:24.480]   extreme simplicity, which is possessed by Apple design. I think that I think it's pretty damaging
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:28.720]   for Samsung. I mean, you know, to be just, to get it. No, it isn't. They get to sell their,
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:33.520]   they do. You know, like get a tablet in the UK and you on the UK are going to find out about that
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:40.720]   and go, Oh, right. It's not cool. It's not cool to own that. Was the judge right writing like a
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.000]   fixed gear bicycle and drinking a PBR while he said it's very hipster judge. Very hipster.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:54.480]   Oh, I'm sorry. You're not cool enough. Wow. Okay. I think I think Samsung would rather have the
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:58.400]   judgment in its favor. That's what I think. That's uncool then the other way around.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.840]   Yeah. Although you're right. All the press was Samsung's not cool. Right.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.720]   Samsung does have a bunch of ads and one of the ads, the Andy Dongle ad I thought was quite good.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:12.720]   Should we, we always show the Apple, we should share that one. It's a pretty funny ad. Although,
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:19.440]   it's an ad for the Samsung Galaxy S3 to show what it can do and that, you know, the iPhone can't.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.000]   But you know, these ads really show what the S3 could do in the limited ecosystem. If
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.960]   everybody has an S3, for instance, yeah, it's easy to share pictures.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.960]   Well, and also if you have an iPad, I mean, I'm sorry, if you have an Apple TV hooked into
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:35.040]   your college room, then you can do this with your iPhone and iPad right now. So it's, yeah.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.600]   So this is the, this is, this is to demonstrate all share. He's looking for his dongle. We need a
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.520]   dongle. Yes. We need a dongle. Brandon, you sleep.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.520]   Grace the dog. Susan, do you have a dongle? No, I didn't bring my dongle. I'm having a little
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:53.840]   dongle issue. Dooley has a dongle. I don't have a dongle, sir. Let's get started.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.120]   Do you guys have a dongle? We're not using a dongle. See, it's pretty cool, huh?
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:05.040]   Share files instantly only on the Galaxy S3. That's a good, by the way. That is what every
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:10.400]   conference sound like I speak at NAB and I don't know. Where's the dongle? Do you need to
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.400]   bring my own DGA or DVI or HDMI? Yeah, I always, that's the thing. I have a dongle.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.600]   I have a lot of shit. Yeah. I have my dongle kit. Bottom all. I all 12 collect all 12.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:27.200]   But you're right. Apple TV. I think what you just said at Andy about taking your Apple TV on the
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:37.680]   road with you and using the, wow, that's amazing. Pop. You waiting for the next one on the stack?
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.960]   I've tried to pop the stack. You guys, Chrome as a browser. Chrome as a browser.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:45.680]   Chrome as the default browser. Oh, yeah. I forget. Okay. Dropping off your stack.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:50.720]   China gets the iPad. China gets the iPad. Actually, we said it all. This is a July 20th. New iPad
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:56.720]   goes to China. That was because they resolved the, the, you know, the lawsuit from the company.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.560]   But now there's a lawsuit about Siri. Oh, of course there is. Who cares? I don't care.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:06.960]   Yeah. Chrome. So some developer was on Hacker News today said, look, if we all just put this
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.200]   little code in here that says if, if, you know, when somebody clicks on a link, if Chrome,
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.000]   launch Chrome, if not launch Apple's browser on Safari, then it doesn't have to be the default
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.800]   browser. In other words, Apple is only, as far as only the default browser, if none is specified.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.960]   So an app could specify or could check for a browser. I'd love to see that in the preferences
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.240]   because I would too. I'd really love to go to Chrome. Well, and that's what, that's what this
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:32.240]   guy was saying is that, you know, if somebody's got Chrome on their iPad or iPhone, it's because
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:37.360]   they want to use it. Right. Right. It's not like, oh, I accidentally put Chrome on here.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.120]   Well, assuming if you're in the Chrome ecosystem, and if you're signed in and you have a lot of the,
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.800]   assuming that this is, I haven't really dug into it too deeply yet, but it ties into all your other
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.800]   Chrome experiences. It's a big deal for people who use a lot of Google apps. All right, Chrome,
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:56.560]   like me. I think, I think we've said enough. We've moved on. What was it? So as China was,
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:04.160]   it was Chrome, there was one other thing. But this is why I need a real stack. Not a, not a human
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.280]   stack malware. And then we already talked about it. Now where we did. So I pass through the three
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.640]   things. All right. Good. All right. Good. All right. Good. I know what I have to pop,
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:13.360]   like Fort mobile app. And then we will do our picks of the week.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:19.360]   Andy, I want you to start doing mountain lion tips. Have we given up tips?
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.120]   We have not. If you have an eyes tip, I will do it. I got a tip. And I wish Andy would start
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.520]   doing some mountain lion tips. But of course, it's literally specifically about my, I don't know.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.760]   I could, I do have a tip ready. Okay. Doesn't have to be specific. But just, I'm saying going
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.440]   forward at some point. I'd love to hear some more about my online. This is so I can steal it
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.960]   from my cruise, cruise lecture. I'll give you credit. And now an Andy and not go tip.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:46.560]   But first, let's talk about electric vehicles. The Ford Focus 2012 Focus is out.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:52.640]   You can get it at your EV certified Ford dealer right now. It is awesome. And when you go to test
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:57.520]   drive it, bring your smartphone. You can bring your iPhone, your blackberry phone, or even your,
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.120]   your blackberry phone or your Android phone, even your blackberry. They have an app for it.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:10.320]   And you install it and then you can control the charging. I mean, you can, it will tell you where
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.880]   the plug-in, you know, chargers are, where you're going. It will help you choose the most eco-friendly
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:23.520]   route. This is just so cool. This is their kind of demonstration of what a smartphone app can do
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.760]   when you design the car as a platform for apps. There's an API and the whole thing.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.720]   The 2012 Ford Focus, you can find out more about it and all the electric technologies
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:39.440]   being offered by Ford at Ford.com/technology. And they have a little bit about the My Ford
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.160]   Mobile app and my Ford mobile website, by the way. You can log into the website and see who's on
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:50.640]   the leaderboard for most CO2 saved. Is the Focus shipping? Oh, yeah. It's out. But yeah, well,
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.880]   you know, I should go down. We'll go down and take a look. The Apple Tayou are your cars.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:01.840]   I love that. I need that. You need, he lost his car. I lost my car at the liquor store.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.840]   This is such a bad, I wasn't drunk. I just want to say I hadn't had anything to drink, but I...
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.160]   Well, in the ironies, liquor stores are like a cross-the-street-free-
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.840]   It's like a block and a half away. But you called the pedal in my place and my car is stolen.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.840]   And they found it. They gave it the liquor store. And then they made a lot of fun of me.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.120]   Did they? Did they laugh at you? They're nice guys. They were nice. I like the color of my CD.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.240]   They didn't charge me for it, which I thought I was going to get something.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.320]   I know, really. No, they felt sorry for you. If you had this app, you wouldn't have needed that.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.640]   Yes. You can also, like you see, when you get the Ford Focus,
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.840]   you can charge it on regular AC, but you're going to want to get the power charge at 240
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:40.560]   volts charge. Because then it charges a couple of hours. And it will also, the phone will say,
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.920]   "Oh, it's charging. This is what its charge level is." You can press a button and says,
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:47.840]   "Charge only at the off-peak rates," things like that. It's really cool.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.040]   What it is... I know I'm making a big deal out of this, but what it really means is that they have
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:17:00.720]   put hooks in... There's an API for the car. They've put hooks in the car so that you can write apps for
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.840]   it. I'm telling you, this is mind-boggling. Just trust me, you'll see why this changes everything.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.760]   Do you get the hoof sticker? I don't know if California does the hoof sticker.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.600]   Yeah, yeah they do. That's always... Well, you'll get a hoof sticker. What's more hoof
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.040]   than an all-electric vehicle that does 102 miles per gallon? I think most of these,
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.320]   you get a hoof sticker. The reason that that's important for all of you who commute is the...
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:27.200]   Getting a hoof sticker means that you can be by yourself in the high occupancy vehicle lane.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.360]   Right. Which is a big deal in San Francisco.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.000]   AKA the carpool lane. Why did they decide to call it the hoof lane? I don't know.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.960]   Of? Of? Is it hover hoof? I don't know. It could be either.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:41.840]   I mispronounce things all the time. I'm starting... People are now tweeting me,
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:45.200]   telling me I mispronounce stuff. It's great. I just love the Twitter.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.920]   All right. Thank you, Ford, for your support. By the way, Ford.com/technology. And I...
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.520]   Oh, a tip from you there, Ladi. What do you got for us?
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:01.040]   So, I have kids. I know you never know that, but... Yes. I never talk about it.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:07.840]   So, one of the problems that I have is that my kids both have my old iPads.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.960]   And they play Angry Birds. But then when you click on Angry Birds, there's one place where
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:20.320]   you can go to movies. And when you go to movies, it takes them to YouTube. And then, before you know,
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.000]   within 10 seconds, they're watching some movie where there's swearing. Really loud.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.960]   They're like, "Hey, you're just..." Not good. Not good.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.240]   I just didn't know what else to do other than turn them off of Wi-Fi, but there's things that
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.240]   they want to be able to download and they want to be able to look at stuff.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.960]   It's too bad. There's four years old already. I mean, you know...
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.360]   It's like parental controls. I wish there were something like that.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.040]   So, what you have is restrictions, which I didn't know anything about. So, under your general settings,
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.840]   there is restrictions. And if you turn that restriction on, you can enable restrictions
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:57.520]   and put in a little code. And so, once you put that code in, there are things that you can
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:04.160]   basically turn off. So, you can't open Safari or YouTube or Camera or FaceTime or iTunes or Ping.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:11.600]   I know the Ping one will be hard for you. Or you cannot install apps or you cannot delete apps
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.040]   or you can't use a dictation or change... They have a way to block Ping? Yes.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:20.240]   Here, we'll block Ping. Ooh. Okay. Now it's... That's kind of funny.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:27.360]   So, you can block... So, you can basically put all those together. And so, what that means is that
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:33.360]   without the login code, they can't open Safari or YouTube specifically. Those are the ones that we
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.160]   want to be able to turn off so that they don't end up with swearing application and swearing movies.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:42.560]   And so, my wife is very upset about it. I'm just kind of like, well, eventually they're going to
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.160]   go to Europe. Is it that she doesn't want them to watch it or just doesn't want them to swear really loud?
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:51.360]   I think she just doesn't want our kids to swear. I think that's the bottom line. She doesn't want
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:57.280]   our kids to go to their preschool and swear in front of the other kids. I think that's the
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:02.720]   person. Makes the mom look bad. So, anyway, that's... Turning on restrictions will let you
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.600]   have a little bit more control over what your kids do with your iPad. Parental restrictions
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:14.560]   are fantastic. Fantastic. Andy, not code. Do you have... Well, I'm sorry. Just... I was
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:24.560]   just... I was looking at magazines in the... Nevermind. Andy, do you have a tip for an OS X?
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.760]   I have one of those simple tips that has been lurking underneath your keyboard for a long time
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.520]   waiting for you to leave an action when you are stupid and can't think of something.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:39.360]   We're familiar that Coco apps have built... Most Coco apps have built-in autocorrecting their
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.680]   text editors so that if you miss Bella Word and you have to... And you haven't disabled the feature,
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:51.120]   it'll underscore, "Hey, numb... Idiot. Here's the... " " "Numb skull." "Numb skull. Numb feet. So, you haven't...
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:57.120]   " "Hey, numb foot." After the show, I have to tell you about incident in which I...
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:02.640]   I almost said a naughty word. Then said, "Hopefully, you know, I almost said a naughty word that I
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:09.520]   corrected myself by saying a word that's even naughty." But anyway... Back to words. So,
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.880]   oftentimes, I can't spell a word like "Rena's Tons." And so, I'll try it like four different times.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.640]   It doesn't work. Then finally, I'll just hold down the option key, click on it to get like a
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.640]   suggested spelling. And sometimes, I've done such a bad job of spelling if there are no suggestions.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:34.240]   There is an actual way to force auto-complete where... I'm pretty sure the first three letters of
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.280]   Renaissance are re-n because it's my friends who go to rent and invest. If you just type the first
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:44.080]   few letters of the word and then hit the escape key, that will pop up a list of suggested, completed
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.400]   words. And usually, more often than not, at least, the word that you wanted is actually at the top
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:52.480]   of the list. So, if you can't even guess at it, or if you are humble enough to realize that you
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:56.800]   are not going to be able to guess correctly at this word, you can just simply punt two or three
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:00.960]   letters into the word and it will give you a list of eight to ten candidates that it might be.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:10.480]   Very nice. Auto-complete helps you spell Renaissance. Renaissance. You just... You know, you gotta
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:16.880]   remember to French. It's the re-boych. All I know about the Renaissance are "Hey, naughty, naughty,
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:26.400]   and huzzah." Also, turkey legs were really, really popular back then. Yes, yes, and guys were baggy
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:32.400]   tights. I seem to remember some of that as well. Do you have a pick of the week first, Alex?
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:37.440]   Yes, you can start. You know, I can drive if you want because I just downloaded it. I'm good to go.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:43.040]   All right. So, I want to return to one. I want to return to one. And then I'll have another pick as
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:50.960]   one. The return to one is... There's one called Blotter, which I think when I was excited about it,
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.160]   and now I've been using it and it's just... I don't remember that much. I just went in here that
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.240]   week. All right. So, Blotter, you can download it on the Mac App Store and what it does is it takes
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:05.200]   your... It basically takes your iCal and puts it on your desktop. So, like a Blotter. But yeah,
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.160]   basically it uses... It's your desktop image. So, there you can see how screwed I am this week.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:15.440]   So, anyway, so... Send bucks. But anyway, so I can turn... I have a couple of them turned off right
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:21.440]   now, but you have all these... You can turn on and off different calendars. And all your calendars
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.360]   will show up and you have a to-do list. You have what's going on right now, like a little snapshot,
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:30.160]   as well as the next seven days or just the week to week. And it really... You know, my biggest problem
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:35.840]   is I don't show it for meetings because I don't realize they're... Yeah. And so, it's really important
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.480]   as... And we've already kind of created a culture within our company that you have to put it on.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:46.880]   You know, you have to send out an either iCal or Google calendar schedule or the meeting doesn't
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.120]   exist. Now, we don't feel bad about missing it. This only works with iCal? I think it works with
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.360]   Google Cal, too. I believe it works with Google Cal, but my iCal is looking at my Google calendar.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.920]   You see, I don't use iCal. I use busy Cal. So, I only... But any of those... I don't know if it'll work
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.560]   with the other ones, but I know that this will look at... I'm only having it look at iCal, but iCal,
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:11.040]   in turn, is looking at my Google iCal, my Google calendar. So, anyway, so it's great. It puts it up
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:15.520]   there. You can't click on it, which is great, so that you don't accidentally. It's just in the
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:19.600]   background. And you can see it. Now, you can add... You can also... There is a little menu item that
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:24.480]   allows you to add new events or new reminders. And of course, you can quit it there as well.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:30.800]   Anyway, so it's a great little application that makes it all work. Now, the... Anyway,
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:35.440]   so that's... This is sweet. I'm just installing it. Maybe I haven't recommended this one before.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.920]   Now you might have. I just... Anyway, so it is... It really... I just have so much going on most of
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.840]   the time that I just have to have something in front of me constantly. And it's great, because
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.800]   now instead of opening iCal, I go, "What do I have coming up next?" And it's got a little nice little
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:51.360]   line that shows where I am in the day and so on and so forth. So, anyway, so that's cool. And
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.880]   then the other things that the other thing that I'm... that I was kind of into is, of course, the new
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.800]   G+ app that we released on. Which no one uses, but now is even more beautiful.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.360]   You know what's kind of funny is that I find G+, my post to G+, get a lot more...
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.080]   Oh, yeah. ...the kind of people. I get a lot more response on them than I get on Twitter or
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.400]   Facebook. And this is beautiful. They've had... It's amazing. Yeah, they announced it for the
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:20.000]   Android tablets at Google I/O a couple of weeks ago. They said they were going to do it for an
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.120]   iPad and they've done a nice job. It's really great. When you go to see how they all kind of...
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.520]   Yeah, it's absolutely... I mean, this is... I think this is the best mobile app out there right now.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:33.120]   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that Facebook or Twitter... No, new Twitter was released
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.640]   during our show, I think. So, I haven't looked at that one as much yet, but it's pretty slick.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.800]   And then, of course... And you can play the videos right in the... in the thing, which is nice.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.040]   And then you can do it. You can just click hang out. There's Lamar.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:51.840]   I gotta go... I gotta get Lamar back on the... He's so great. How do I get rid of this thing, though?
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:56.320]   What do you all want that one, man? Oh, man. This is cool. This is beautiful.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:00.880]   Really, really well integrated. I love how those... Yeah. And the hangouts are all totally
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:06.000]   integrated. So, if you hit your little bars at the top there, you can... I took it off. Sorry. Do I have to pull back out?
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.360]   Oh, there you go. There's little bars. Yeah. So, you hit those... And hangouts are right there. So,
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.480]   you can hit... And you can use the iPads, camera and everything. Yeah. And it's just... And you just
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.920]   select people. Just click on a few people and you can invite them to hang out. You know, it's actually
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:25.440]   much easier than the... It won't do it immediately. Okay. You can do it with one person. I'll just pick
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.240]   one person and start hanging out. But you can see how you just kind of click, click, click, click,
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:33.440]   and then invite them. Hello. Based on the picture. And you can see yourself. Yeah. So... That's cool.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:40.480]   So, anyway, that's my thing. I like that. And... Oh, hang up on my hangout. How do you hang up on
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.960]   my hangout? There. Andy and I call you pick of the week. My pick of the week is actually a magazine,
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:52.960]   a new magazine by one of my favorite podcasters in the whole world. Jeff Goldsmith... Jeff Goldsmith
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:59.280]   had this really great screenwriting podcast called the Q&A where he would host... He said in LA,
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.880]   he would host a screening of a popular movie or a classic movie and then do a two-hour Q&A with
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:10.640]   the screenwriter that talks all about how the script was put together, the guy's career, and
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.480]   what his theories are on storytelling, but also the problems that he confronted in putting this
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.680]   together. And it's not... It's the exact opposite of the sort of stuff that we're talking about earlier
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.200]   about. The thing is, I feel as though I'm a conduit for my muse. When I'm in that zone,
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.560]   no, it's all about... And then they said, "Oh, good news. We just signed Zach Galifianakis,
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:34.640]   so you need to change that character with me played by Zach Galifianakis." That's the sort of
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:42.160]   stuff. If you can... This isn't... I'll make this a double pick. Definitely do a Google search for
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:48.240]   the podcast of the Q&A about the movie Valkyrie with Tom Cruise because the screenwriter is also
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:53.600]   the screenwriter of the muse of the usual suspects. And so it is a two-hour conversation,
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.800]   just about one of the most incredible screenwriters with the most incredible stories about how he
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:05.200]   puts these things together ever. So Jeff is just... He's an editor-in-chief of Creative Screenwriting
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.080]   Magazine. He's put together this new magazine called Backstory that is essentially like the Q&A
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:15.280]   only in magazine form. So they're interviews with writers and interviews with storytellers,
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:20.400]   and it's very slickly produced, very nicely put together. It's not just someone took a Microsoft
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:24.640]   Word file and converted it to an e-pump or anything like that. Very nicely put together. What I love
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.960]   about it is that I downloaded the first issue, and I saw a couple of really good articles. Here's
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:33.440]   an interview with the person... One of the people who was responsible for Pixar's Brave for the
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.080]   story there. Here's another one about a couple of different unproduced stories on produced screen
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.360]   plays. And the interviews are really, really good. The stories are really, really good. But then,
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:45.760]   like at the end, it says, "Oh, and here's the complete screenplay of the movie that we're just
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:51.520]   talking about." Or, "Here's a movie that you can now watch all about that." And I think that it's
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:57.280]   just... I think that I'm looking at the archives of the past six issues because it just keeps
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:02.400]   scrolling... They table contest. Just keeps scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.760]   So you buy one issue and I think it's truly something that you can then dip into for two weeks' worth
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.320]   of reading. If you like movies, if you like storytelling, if you like the craft of writing,
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:18.560]   great, great, great stuff, start to finish. And the good news is that they just kicked it off with
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.920]   issue number one. You can go to the new stand app and go to iTunes and download the Backstory,
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:28.800]   the new stand app. The first issue is free. So you can get that all for free right now. It's going
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:35.040]   to be bi-monthly. And this is the very first time that I've actually subscribed to any magazine
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.240]   off of iOS. It doesn't matter how much I like the New Yorker, it doesn't matter how much I like
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:45.520]   these other magazines. I've never said, "Okay, I will buy a year's worth of issues of this because
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:51.040]   the first one was just so good and such a rich container full of stuff to read."
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:55.680]   What's the name of it again? It's called Backstory. Backstory.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:03.280]   C-K-S-T-O-R-Y. And the cover is the classic version. You can see it here.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:10.560]   Yeah, you can see Prometheus being attacked by an actual alien because that's one of the
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:17.280]   stories here. But man, here's the table of contents behind me. It just keeps going and going and going
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:29.120]   and going and going and going. Here's the writers behind the dictator, Sasha Baron Cohen.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:35.680]   Just great, great stuff. As I said, I read two or three articles I really, really liked,
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.040]   but then there was still at least a half a dozen things or a dozen things left to go through.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:42.480]   So good stuff. Well, I'm a big fan of the movies. That sounds good.
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:47.520]   And you're right because you're picking minor complimentary. This just came out. It's called Next
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.960]   Issue. I think it came out on Android first. Just came out for the iPad today.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:56.960]   You can go to nextissue.com and learn a little bit more about it. What if there were a news stand
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.440]   where you pay one flat fee, kind of like Netflix or Hulu Plus, and you get all the magazines?
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:09.280]   That's the idea. Ten dollars a month gets you, they say dozens of top magazines. Conde Nast is
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:16.160]   clearly a part of this. So there are quite a few magazines. Wired, Esquire, People Magazine,
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:24.320]   Entertainment Weekly, Golf Digest. If you pay $15 a month, you can also get weekly magazines,
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:30.480]   like The New Yorker, People, and Sports Illustrated. So you pay one flat fee, and you get all these
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:36.880]   choices of all these magazines. The good news is 30 days free. So I downloaded a few magazines.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.840]   Some of them are pretty cool, like the Wired Magazine--
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.320]   Is this the interactive one? Or is it just the sample?
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.960]   Well, that's what's interesting. It looks like it's up to the magazine to decide how nicely they're
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:53.760]   going to be. So the Wired Magazine starts with a video and then it resolves into the cover of
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:32:00.240]   Wired Magazine. That's kind of cool. Here come the drones. The UI seems to vary depending on
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:08.480]   the magazine. So in this case, we're seeing it in landscape mode. You scroll through it when you
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.680]   see something that has more below. Some of the magazines show an arrow down, but you pretty much
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:18.560]   learned that you have to scroll right and left. If you tap the bottom, you actually get a pretty nice
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:26.240]   index of all the pages, including chapters and titles. So you can quickly jump where you want.
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:32.480]   Also, the table of contents is live. So if you browse the table of contents, you can tap an
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:38.000]   article and get to that. So that's Wired Magazine. And you see they have all the issues. I think
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:45.040]   it says on mine, I don't know if this has to do with my available memory or if this is something
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:50.960]   they really do. But it says I can have a maximum of 192 issues. That's me.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:54.880]   I think that might be your memory. It might be my memory. I don't know. But that's a lot. In other
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:33:01.280]   words, that's plenty. Some of the magazines, I'll show you a real simple because she's a nice little
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:06.960]   kind of cooking and lifestyle magazine. And you can see it's not portrait mode. It's only,
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:13.360]   it's not landscape mode, it's only portrait mode. So that would be a little bit frustrating.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:18.080]   But I guess they felt like, well, our magazine, this is our magazine format. So it just makes
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:23.680]   more sense that way. You get all the ads you notice. It's basically the contents of the magazine.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:27.040]   So but it doesn't have a lot of interactive features built into it. It's just depends on the
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:34.400]   magazine. It does. So you like Kate Upton? Who doesn't like Kate Upton? So if this is the latest
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:39.920]   GQ magazine, so out of it, I don't even know who Kate Upton is. I don't either. Okay. I have no idea.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.960]   Everyone likes her. I have no idea who she is. But there's lots of pictures of her. And then
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.800]   there's a video in there. So when you say interactive, I don't know.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:51.440]   It does. There is some. It doesn't look too interactive, but there is multimedia.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.120]   But it's not just a scan of the magazine. No, it's not. And in this case, you're probably
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:01.680]   glad of that. So let me just get out of it. This is what kind of caught my attention earlier and
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:07.280]   made me completely. So you know, now you got to pay $15.99 a month if you want to get people
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:12.160]   magazine. But you know, I want to know why did Katie leave, Tom? And you can go right to it.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:17.360]   So if you read a lot of magazines, 16 bucks a month, it seems like that would be a good deal.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:25.520]   And it sure does make the iPad a great way to read. I can press plus or minus and I can zoom in.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:32.320]   It seems to see, I can't pinch, but it does seem to be this is dependent on the magazine publisher.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:40.000]   How much effort they put into this, right? Presumably the platform gives you some more
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.480]   capabilities. I'd love to be able to zoom in. Can't, you know, tap an article. So it's not
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:52.320]   exactly flip board, but it ain't bad either. And I guess it really is going to be valuable for
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.120]   somebody who reads a lot of magazines. And I'll tell you, if you're traveling, by the way,
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:59.360]   New Yorker is on here, but this is part of the higher end subscription, very much like the New
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:04.000]   Yorker app. So that's what's interesting about this. A lot of these companies already have the
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.720]   own app. Now, one of the nice things New Yorkers done is they've got a link back to the website.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:12.560]   So you can read comments on it. They've got share links, not all the magazines do that, but you could
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:16.880]   so just tweet it. It's like Netflix for magazines. It's Netflix for magazines.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.880]   Is that more expensive? Yeah, a lot more expensive. But if you read it, and again,
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.840]   so this would be totally useless if you didn't read a lot of magazines. On the other hand,
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:27.680]   if you read a lot of magazines, this is great. Yeah. It's just, you know, 10 bucks for the
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:34.800]   monthlies. It's great. It's 15 bucks. And you know, how much is it? New Yorker subscription,
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:39.040]   even on the iPad is not that much, not 15 bucks a month. So it only makes sense if you, you know,
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:46.000]   I wish they had the economist to the cable approach. It is. It's a manual. But I think the bid here
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   is to be the new standard. What's interesting is none of these magazines are saying, well,
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.520]   we're just going to do an app or just going to be next issue. They're all looking at multi-platform.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:58.080]   The interesting thing here is you are getting a choice where you're getting a choice of,
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:01.680]   I can buy, if I only want the economist, I can buy the economist or... Exactly.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:07.760]   I don't think the economist is on here. It's not a lesson. It seems mostly a Condi and Time Life.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:15.520]   But I mean, Wired is definitely one of the ones that I always read. So Time Magazine is on here,
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:21.120]   not Newsweek, not the Economist, not US News, or popular mechanics is on here. People is on here.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:27.360]   Parents, money. Anyway, worth looking. It's free for 30 days. Make sure you cancel
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:30.640]   because they'll auto-charge your credit card. You do have to give them a credit card if you
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:36.160]   sign up for it. But you can go to nextissue.com, create an account, sign up, and you'll see the
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.920]   difference. It's $15 a month if you want entertainment weekly. People, sports illustrated in New
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:46.240]   York or in Time. Otherwise, the monthlies are only 10 bucks a month. My only problem is the
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.280]   number one reason I use a magazine is for the 10 minutes up and down on a flight.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:56.400]   Right. That's what I needed. I don't read a lot of magazines. The only time I can't open my
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:01.680]   iPad is when I write. That taught me patience because I decided that I'm not going to spend.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:06.240]   Why am I spending $5 just out of fear that I'll spend 10 minutes inside my own head?
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:12.480]   It truly became a self-discipline thing that I had to do. No, I don't want to spend any time
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:19.280]   in my head. That's the last place I want to be. I'm not a big magazine reader, but I know people
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:24.720]   who spend at least this much a month on magazines. Oh, yeah, absolutely. And for them, this would be
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.440]   probably a good choice. It's called nextissue free for 30 days worth of try, I think.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.720]   That is it for Mac Break Weekly for this week. I thank you all so much for being here. We do the
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:40.640]   show. Oh, it's somebody's birthday, isn't it? Do you want to light those? Fortunately, they did
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:46.400]   not try to get my actual age. Otherwise, this would be a bonfire. Are you 50, finally?
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:51.840]   Yeah, yeah. No, no, you don't have to light those birth. I don't know if we have time for you.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.720]   I don't know what my age is actually. I think I'm. It's a it's a candlest birthday cake. 42,
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:01.680]   I think. Happy birthday, Alex Lindsay. Is there a creative comments birthday song we can sing?
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.640]   Ooh, that looks really good. Looks very tasty. Now it's like spin it slowly and you just stare at
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:14.320]   the spiral. I think you will get hip-mokedized. I am getting sleepy. I will not eat carbohydrates.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:17.680]   Except for this. Wait a minute. They put the candles in the twitch shape.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.120]   I just got that. Very nicely done, Burke McQuan. Did Burke do that or Tony?
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:30.160]   Nicely done. Look at that. Are you hypnotized? All right, have some cake. Happy birthday, Alex.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:34.640]   You can have that all to yourself. It's easier to get my wish here, actually. Andy will put a
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:40.960]   slice in the mail to you. Please. I'll accept it's cash equivalent. We do this show each and
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:47.840]   every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, except that Leo can't really start. So whenever he kind of gears up,
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:53.200]   why is that? That's so weird. I was sitting here. We sat here for 20 minutes. I just couldn't begin.
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:39:01.440]   Because because greetings are to be savored and partings are so sad. I know. I don't want to say
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:06.400]   goodbye either. You notice 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 18, how are you? T. C.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:12.080]   Alex Lindsey from thepicksalcord.com. Don't bother trying to hire them. They're very, very busy.
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.920]   It's a little crazy. He's not going to be back. You're not going to be back for a while.
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:21.760]   Well, I'm going to try to. Next week, I'm in Sydney. I'm leaving right now or in a couple hours for
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.600]   London. I'll be in Sydney by next week. I'm going to try to log in from there. So assuming I have a
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:31.120]   good hotel, I got a nice hotel just so I hopefully get a good bandwidth. Then I'll be back for the 24th.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.160]   Be nice to have you in studio, but we will be glad to talk to you in Sydney.
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.440]   I'm going to be on the 24th. I'll be back. And that's a big day because that's today.
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.440]   Apple's an analyst call and perhaps an announcement of Mountain Line. I think on the 31st time in
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.560]   Tokyo. Anytime.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:54.960]   Pixelcord.tv for the podcasts. I want to make something very clear. You do a podcast called
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:00.080]   This Week in Photography. Yes. We do a podcast called Twit Photo. I understand it's confusing.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:06.400]   We're putting Twit Photo on high. Well, maybe even working photos is we used to do Twit at the
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.360]   Twit office. I know. You are still Frederick Van Joss is still doing this. Still doing great
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.800]   photography. Having great people on great conversations. This week in photography, your
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:21.920]   Twit is still running and is the website. It is just who knows. Just Google it. But that's not
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:28.400]   the same as Catherine Hall's Twit Photo. Just so you know, I'm confused too. Trip is not canceled.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.880]   Yeah. Trip is dog good. Frederick had to like tweet. I'm not canceled. I don't know what they're
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:40.480]   talking about. And not canceled. Andy Enoco does a great podcast in the five by five network called
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:46.880]   Enoco's Almanac. Most weeks he also joins us every week. You'll be here next week. Yes.
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:50.320]   I will be here next weekend. We got to do something about your bandwidth because he's very
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:55.440]   eight bit. Very eight bit. Your video froze for some reason. I don't know why. That's just an eight
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:00.560]   bit thing. What do you think, Chad? Is that us? No. That's him. It's a possible I'm simply
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:05.120]   unloved by God on this day. Or Verizon. Or Verizon, which is much the same thing.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:09.280]   Did you see? I can't believe you have. So you have Fios and you're getting that kind of bandwidth?
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:14.800]   Oh, I don't know. My internet service has been a little bit weird for the past couple of weeks.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:21.600]   But is it Fios? It is Fios. Maybe I need to upgrade to the larger bandwidth version of the
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.880]   one bit Fios. The eight bit Fios. Also, unfortunately, it's just like any office where the only way to
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:32.160]   keep it clean is to like once every two years, move everything out and then move things back in.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:38.720]   Again, I'm at that stage with networking, which is I need to take apart my entire. I've been here
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.640]   for like two or three years. I know I've been adding or removing so many things. I need to
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.120]   remove every piece of networking when you card wear and rebuild my network from scratch.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.120]   And you need to build. You need to put a switch in there and get it your own VLAN. And then you
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:56.000]   just have a VLAN that is just for Mac break and then VLAN for everything else.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:04.480]   Can you do me a favor before you move to Wisconsin? You can do it anytime.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:12.000]   Netalizer Andy, if you run it for me and send us the report, N-E-T-A-L-Y-Z-R.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.840]   And it will tell us a little bit more about what's going on there.
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.640]   That's a really useful thing. It's run by the University of California at Berkeley.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:24.880]   And it's a little Java program that will analyze things like buffer,
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:28.480]   blowing all sorts of stuff. Any T-A-L-Y-Z-R, if you Google it, you'll find it.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.600]   That's how we find routers. We do a lot of router issues.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.440]   It's a really good way to find router issues.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:39.520]   Alex and I should get together. We'll do our hair, talk about boys, and then talk about network
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.200]   review. Yes, of ours.
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.320]   Yes. So this VLAN thing.
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:47.920]   All right. Thank you, Andy and I go, thank you all for being here. We'll see you next time.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:57.760]   Now get back to work because break time is over.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.340]   (upbeat music)
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.580]   (drum beats)
