[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.680]   This is Mac break weekly episode five for September 8th, 2006.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.680]   DINOMATIC.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.960]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mac break weekly episode five.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.520]   Recorded on September 8th, 2006.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.360]   It should appear sometime in early 2007.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.560]   Much like Windows Vista.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.800]   Joining us right now, anybody want hot dogs?
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.160]   Merlin Mann of 43folders.com.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.160]   Hello Merlin.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.160]   How's it going Leo?
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.920]   I'm not going to tell people what your Skype handle is, but I do enjoy it.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.760]   Well, if anybody can figure it out, I'll be waiting.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.240]   It's an offer for all the ladies.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.240]   Let's put it that way.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.080]   To all the ladies, he is the ladies man.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.080]   Merlin Mann.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.200]   Scott Borne is here from iLifeZone.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.200]   Hi Scott.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.400]   Thanks for filling in for the last eight weeks.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.520]   Well, thank you for letting me, Leo.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.160]   It's quite an honor to stand in your very large shoes.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.400]   They're not that big.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400]   I got a size 43.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.480]   I do have a red nose and a wig, but the shoes are pretty normal.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.000]   And from the Pixel Core and just back from Zimbabwe, Alex himself.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Mr. Lindsey.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Hello.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Hello.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   How are you?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I'm doing well.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Or better yet, Monero.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I just got back from Zimbabwe.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So, Monero?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   No, it's quite a say.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Hot dog.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Hot dog.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.200]   We have, of course, the biggest story of the week, which is not even happening yet.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.240]   And we do have to get this podcast out before it happens.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.600]   Otherwise, all of our prognostications will sound pathetic.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.320]   I'm talking about September 12th.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.160]   It's showtime, according to Apple.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.640]   By the way, that's the name of my new podcast book.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.680]   And I'm really peeved that somebody...
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.680]   Oh, no.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.680]   Somebody leaped it to them.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.680]   That's not nice.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.560]   Okay, predictions.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.840]   Scott Borne, what do you think?
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.080]   I think I'm going to yawn on September 13th.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   No, you're not.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   You're going to yawn?
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.720]   I'm going to yawn because if what they're offering is $15 movie downloads from Disney,
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   and that's it, good night, I want to pay 15 bucks when I could pay 18 and get the full
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.720]   blown DVD.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.880]   I don't know why you would want to take four hours to download a movie and not get any
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.160]   extras and it's low quality.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160]   I don't...
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.160]   I agree with you on that.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.920]   I can buy the DVD, use Handbrake, Rip It To My iPod, Game Over.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.960]   Do you think they'll be a new iPod announcement on Tuesday?
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.080]   I think they're going to announce the new iPhone.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   Phone?
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.600]   Are you just kidding?
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   I'm just kidding.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.680]   Are you nuts?
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.840]   I don't have any idea.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.600]   I think it's mostly just going to be the movie store.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.760]   I think we've...
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.280]   You know, they did the iMacs early.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280]   They got it in...
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   It's time to do a new iPod, don't you think?
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   They haven't had one.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   It's been anything.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.240]   I think we'll probably see something like the Metal Case Nano or something.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   Nothing big.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.760]   A Metal Case Nano.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.080]   Merlin Mann, you agree?
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.080]   I don't know.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   I think when...
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.040]   A lot of people talked about this being the big movie launch and with the whole...
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.480]   Of course, people are decoding everything about the...
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.480]   I know.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   ...the location and looking at the spotlights.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.480]   I know.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   I think one interesting thing is even if it's not one big splash, two little splashes would
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   be...
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.600]   Yeah, to see some updates to the way the movie stuff works.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.040]   But also to see maybe there's been a lot of talk about a larger screen, iPod video coming
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.160]   out, a couple of things like that.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.080]   It looks like they're going to be racing to at least in name catch up with Amazon on this
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   stuff.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   So you got to wonder what they're going to try and get out there quickly.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.320]   Yeah, today Amazon announced it's going to do its own movie store and offer downloads
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.720]   as well.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.080]   And the one missing element from the Amazon movie store is Disney, which of course, you
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.240]   know, Steve Jobs number one.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.040]   There's one other tiny missing piece from the Amazon store.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   No Macs.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   No Macs.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   Okay.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.640]   There would be another part.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.840]   So that pretty much leaves a big wide hole for Apple to march through, huh?
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.920]   Well, it needs to start with.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.640]   It's all dealing with, of course, the Windows Media DRM, which is what a lot of the guys
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.320]   are doing online stuff.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.320]   Icky, Icky.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.760]   I mean, it's not even to me.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.240]   I have a Windows.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.960]   And of course, if you have an Intel machine, you could run Windows.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   It's not even that.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.800]   It's just that crappy DRM.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.480]   Yeah, it's still the problem with the whole Windows side of things with what Microsoft's
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.280]   approach to it is they really are spending a lot of time catering to the studios instead
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   of the consumer.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.080]   And the problem with that, of course, is that you're not going to sell a lot.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.280]   If you keep on in the studios, we'll get what they want.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.240]   But sometimes they should get what they, you know, as rolling stones.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   But do you have a choice?
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.240]   Sometimes they need to get what they need.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240]   Do you have a choice?
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.520]   Don't you have to get the studios to agree with you?
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.040]   I mean, you can't do this unilaterally.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.120]   You do, but you have to, you know, the point is that, you know, the studios gave Apple
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.080]   a lot of leeway with the music because they had no choice.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.960]   You know, they had to get to a point where they were low enough on the rung that they
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.400]   just had to give Apple what it needed.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.920]   And the only reason what's successful is because they capitulated to Apple and gave
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920]   Apple what it needed to make it successful.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.680]   So they don't need to do that in the movie business.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680]   They've got Amazon.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.880]   They've got a cinema now.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.400]   Why do they need, do they need iTunes?
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.080]   Well, none of them are working.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.080]   That's the problem.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.080]   Ah, no.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.080]   iTunes would work.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.000]   Except Scott says it won't.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It won't.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   It's 15 bucks a piece.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It's not going to work.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   10 bucks for Casablanca?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.960]   Yeah, I mean, well, right now it sounds like what Apple's been obsessed with is really
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.560]   trying to have a singular price.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.080]   So everything, you know, that's what they like.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.040]   Everybody's saying, though, $9.99 for old stuff and $14.99 for new stuff, but nobody
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.040]   knows.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.040]   Right.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.320]   Well, we saw the survey that was put out that said way more people would be interested
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.080]   at $9.99 than would be at $15.99 or $20.99.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080]   Right.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.880]   Yeah, it's a huge jump.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   And so I know that--
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.440]   But do you think a new iPod, Alex?
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.680]   You know, I think there's a chance it sounds like the iPod isn't far enough.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.960]   I don't know if you saw that patent that popped out.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.920]   That's an interesting patent, the interactive device.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.000]   Of course, there was also, at the same time, a patent for the cube.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Right.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   So kids, let's not get all excited here.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.440]   You know, Apple patents a lot of things.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.800]   Doesn't mean they're going to make it.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   Right.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   So--
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.400]   In fact, it's not the first patent for an interactive device like this that Apple's
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   applied for.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.680]   It's just that it's a very interesting one where it switches-- basically switches the
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.720]   entire functionality of the device based on-- you know, you can hit it and it becomes
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   a phone.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.240]   It's using that entire LCD in the front.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.520]   And so the keys are changed depending on what you're using it for.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.880]   So if you hit it, you can see the phone.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.680]   If you hit it again, you see a game player--
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.040]   Are they using that Mac slap program that-- what is the name of that thing where you hit the
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.040]   Mac book and it's--
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.840]   Yeah, it's got the little gyro thing and it detects movement.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.160]   It's a crazy way to move around.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.560]   It depends on how many times you shake it and it changes to a different--
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.120]   I think you're all wrong.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.600]   Well, what do you think it's going to be?
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   I think if Apple weren't going to make a major announcement, they wouldn't have slipstreamed
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.480]   the 24-inch iMac this week.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.560]   In fact, that is in normal course of events.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.400]   That's a big announcement.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.200]   Number two across the iMac line, a 24-inch screen, which is-- I don't know who wants
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   that.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.520]   That's a big announcement for them to put that out this week when they've got a keynote.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.840]   They've got Erba Buena's center, the big conference center in San Francisco booked for Tuesday
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.760]   tells me this is some big announcement they really want a lot of attention for and they
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.040]   don't want anything like a computer to distract them.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.360]   Yeah, I think that there's definitely-- because we went down to the one where they released
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.360]   the HiFi.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.360]   So that was a yawn.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360]   Yeah, it was a yawn.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   And the thing is is that--
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.640]   And the last one was a yawn.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.760]   The MacBook at the WWDC was kind of a yawn.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.600]   Yeah, so I think that if they're making such a big deal about it, I think that it has
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.820]   to be-- now, it might be-- there is the rumor that we're going to see an interactive--
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.760]   I mean, not interactive, but a Wi-Fi connector so that you can wirelessly-- you know, watch
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   your iPod on your--
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   Like the Zoom.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.320]   Yeah, on the TV.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.960]   So I think that that is probably the most likely thing that we're going to see, I think.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:23.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:01.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:36.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:39.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:53.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:49.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:56.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:31.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:38.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   I'm going to be a lot more famous.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.960]   You're right.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.960]   Rubber chicken.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   It's all food.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   It doesn't have anything to do with reality.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   The one thing is we have a lot of anecdotal evidence within this office specifically.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.960]   A great deal of evidence that people who leave their computers plugged in all the time,
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   their laptop batteries become almost useless.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.960]   Well, I think my car runs better after I go to a car wash too.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.960]   It's so hard to, you know, unless you really test these things.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.960]   It's an availability heuristic.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.960]   You're just noticing it because you're noticing it.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   I like that.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960]   What's it called?
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   An availability heuristic.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   The Swedish call it schema.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   Okay.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.960]   They say you can't learn anything from podcast.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   So, S-S-S-C-H-E-M-A-S-K-I-M-A?
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   Well, I don't.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.960]   My Swedish spelling isn't very easy.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   It's not related to that clear beer stuff.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   Is it the Zima?
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   No, no, but schema is one of those things like if you want to buy a new Corvette,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   all of a sudden you see all new corvettes around you.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.960]   They've actually already been there.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   You just weren't noticing that.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   That's schema or availability heuristics.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960]   Wow.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   We have learned something here.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   Okay.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.960]   So, we've kind of jumped around a little bit around this announcement.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   I just want to clarify this.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   I think it's something big.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.960]   I think it's at least a very cool iPod.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   I don't know if it's that super cool, multi-user, monthly function, touch screen iPod that everybody's been talking about,
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   but I think you've got to see a new iPod.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   It's Christmas time.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.960]   You've got to see a new iPod.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   And I think it's going to be something significant.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   Does anybody still believe in an iPod phone anywhere?
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   They got another patent?
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   I have it.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   I don't know.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.960]   Do you want to get in that market?
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.960]   I want a newton, so don't ask me.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   I would buy an iPod phone.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.960]   My daughter would buy an iPod phone.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.960]   You know, I don't know.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   It's just one of these Shangri-Lots things that seems to come up every few months.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.960]   And they're like, "Oh, it's coming right down the pipe now, the iPod phone."
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   I don't know.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   I mean, maybe, maybe so.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   But isn't that going to involve a lot of deals with all different companies?
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   And then it's not an Apple.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   What services are going to support it?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.640]   And on some level, at least you're cannibalizing what's already a pretty fat market with these
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.640]   straight up iPods.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.800]   Yeah, I don't exactly.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.360]   I think you said it perfectly.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:09.680]   I do have to say that I think there's a lot of Mac users at least that would vastly prefer
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.920]   to have an Apple-based phone just because you know they would sync with everything properly.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.920]   I mean, I'm tired of my trio looking up.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.920]   It keeps my trio keeps on stacking up.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   Everybody's phone number.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.200]   Every time I try to sync it, you know, and there's almost nothing I seem to be able to
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   do to get that hot down.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.600]   Do you use Missing Sync?
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.080]   I am using Missing Sync.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.680]   I just still have all kinds of sync issues with it.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.720]   I know I have Windows Mobile 5 and the Missing Sync just -- and I think a lot of Mark's
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   space.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.720]   I think they do great stuff, but it just never has worked right with them.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   It doesn't work for me either.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.280]   I got a trio 650.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.680]   I got Missing Sync.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.800]   And technically they talk to each other, but I ended up with contacts for some guy I don't
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.520]   even know the other day.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.520]   Wow.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.200]   So that's kind of neat.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.360]   It's running wind up.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.200]   It's syncing somewhere with somebody else's computer.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.280]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.120]   I mean, this one guy's got a lot of girlfriends, I'll tell you that.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.120]   Now, come on.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   That's what you told your wife, Scott.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.320]   I don't think I -- I don't know who she is.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.240]   No, that's not mine.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.240]   Who are all these women on here?
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.640]   I don't understand that.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.080]   So she doesn't know how to access any of that stuff, so I'm lucky.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.560]   Does she listen to podcasts?
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.560]   No.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560]   Good.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.560]   You're safe.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   Nor does my wife.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.800]   Nor does she even watch my TV show.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   Join the club.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.400]   It's explaining why I was streaky with the TV show.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.800]   My wife has so much more important things to do than listening to me.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.320]   Isn't that sad?
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.320]   Here we are.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.160]   Now, Carlita Alex's wife is a geek.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.040]   No, but she doesn't listen to me either.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.640]   I used to be like -- Why we love them, their sense.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.320]   I used to be a cartoon character.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.120]   On MSNBC, I was a cartoon character, and I couldn't get my kids to watch it.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   I mean, it's just hopeless.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.000]   No, she has to listen to me over and over and over again.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.920]   That's the last thing she wants to do is watch the TV.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:01.440]   So should I buy -- as long as I'm spending my money -- the iMac 24, which looks pretty
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440]   slick.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.560]   I mean, you've got a core two in it, which is a very, very nice chip.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.080]   Even faster than the core duo, they were touting just a few months ago.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.320]   A 24-inch screen, which is kind of amazing on an iMac.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   It's all in one.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.640]   I mean, a nice graphics card.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.360]   Or should I say, no, I'm going to get a Mac Pro.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360]   Back Pro.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   Why?
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.040]   It just depends on -- Well, actually, Leo, I think for you, I actually would be leaning
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.120]   towards saying that you'd get the iMac.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   Why?
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120]   Why?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   Why?
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.120]   Why?
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   Why?
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.120]   Why?
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.120]   Unless you're really doing --
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.560]   I am pro stuff.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.640]   You need to extend the computer.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.400]   That's the big thing is if you're going to extend it -- so a lot of people that I know
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.000]   buy a G5 or they buy a Mac Pro.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.240]   Does anybody really upgrade?
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.960]   I mean, I have a G5 tower here.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.960]   You do.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.960]   What do you upgrade?
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.920]   Well, we have a big video card.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.400]   We have video capture cards for Mac break, for instance, the capture HD.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.400]   Okay.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.040]   So you need to put in special cards, fiber channel cards, things like that.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.320]   We have a -- I mean, the video card in our -- the video -- we have a 4500 in our -- in
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.400]   video 4500, which I think is like 1,500 bucks just for the video card.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.400]   So it's --
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.000]   I hear -- you know, it's funny because PC users say the same thing.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.040]   They say, "Oh, you can't upgrade it.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.560]   I'm not going to buy a Mini or an iMac.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.880]   You can't upgrade it."
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.320]   I would say 90% of users don't ever upgrade their hardware.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.680]   They just buy new hardware.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   Absolutely.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.680]   And so for 90% of the people, everything from the iMac 24 inches is what they're going
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.680]   to need.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.880]   I mean, you can do shake work, Final Cut Pro.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.280]   So you can do -- you know, it's a very, very fast machine, a very impressive machine on
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.280]   its own.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.520]   How about what you got now, Scott, why did you say I should not buy one?
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.160]   Because if you look at the cache and the bus and the graphics card, if you ever wanted
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.600]   to do something as simple as run aperture, for instance, you would not be at all satisfied
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.600]   with performance.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.120]   I know this for a fact because I looked at the graphics card and I know what kind of
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.440]   experience people are having with that graphics card.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.320]   It's in a G-47300 GT.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.480]   Remember that the programs like aperture and all of the programs coming down the pipe from
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.200]   the Pro Division anyway are going to rely heavily on the GPU, not the CPU.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.000]   If you can't put in a beefy graphics card, you're going to be unhappy.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Plus take a look at it.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.880]   What's the minimum graphics card you'd recommend?
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.320]   The 1900 for aperture.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.680]   That's what I put in my fantasy order that's sitting in my Apple account for my Mac.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.040]   Yeah, you want to have that card.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.960]   And they're just now starting to ship those.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.320]   Also take a look at the cache.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.720]   That's where you're going to see a big difference in throughput.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.040]   Now if all you're ever going to do is use Safari and send email and all that, Alex is
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   absolutely right.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   But you know, you're Leo LaPorte.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.840]   You've got to be a power user.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.240]   Even if I never use it, I've got to be one.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.840]   It's got four megabytes of shared L2 cache.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.240]   It's for a dual processor system.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   That's a lot.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   The thing I don't understand, I mean, I'm coming at this from a completely different
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.240]   point of view.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.600]   I'm trying to understand for most people I know, you know, the MacBook straight out
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.920]   of the box has way more processing power and more everything than they're ever going
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.840]   to need for 90% of what they do.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.520]   And certainly, obviously, people like Alex are going to need something that's got a
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.880]   lot of firepower to it.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.880]   I love my MacBook.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.160]   I have to say, I've been very happy with it.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160]   And it runs fairly well.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   It's great.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.760]   I mean, I run Windows that it seems like full speed.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.000]   I run chess programs on it.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   It's great.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.800]   I run Softimage's XSI on it.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.560]   I mean, on the Windows side, and it's a big 3D application, I'm running it fine on my
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.560]   little MacBook.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.640]   So a lot of what people buy is for bragging rights, not really because they need it.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.800]   Is that what you're saying, Merlin?
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.520]   Well, I think maybe so.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.760]   I mean, I think one thing that's interesting about the 24-inch is, I mean, of course, I
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.120]   come at this from this kind of productivity standpoint.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.480]   And there's so much research out there to talk about how much more effective you can
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.560]   be just moment to moment, having a lot of screen real estate.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.880]   So you're not changing modes.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.480]   You're not changing applications.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:54.240]   And so I think it's interesting to think about how you could have something to compete with
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.560]   the relatively small screen space of a MacBook or a MacBook Pro.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.720]   And that's why I think this is an interesting move to bring out this large screen.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.640]   Because to me, that's what most people are saying is, gosh, I just wish I had a big screen
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.040]   and I don't want to spend a lot of money to go get the big cinema.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.200]   That's why I bought the 30-inch because the truth is, I'm juggling Windows constantly.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   It's just driving me crazy.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:21.160]   And I have a two-screen set up, I have a 23-inch cinema display and a PC display next to it.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.160]   And it's still not enough.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.880]   I need more room.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.640]   Yeah, I got to tell whatever the second biggest moment.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.640]   The 24?
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   Yeah, those are nice.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   Those are really nice.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.640]   Yeah, and the price isn't too bad.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.920]   And the thing is, the jump that you see, I hate to use the word productivity to describe
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.920]   this, but you can just get so much done so much faster.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.360]   And you can put your IM over in the screen, your PowerBook or your MacBook.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.760]   Yeah, no, I just think that's an interesting move.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.680]   And actually, Scott, I was curious about one thing you talked about, I think it was last
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.960]   week on the show where you were talking about just the limitations of some of the software
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:58.600]   that people were depending on to run on MacPro or on the big MacPro.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:04.360]   Yeah, the thing is, is that while these things do have a lot of power, there isn't a lot
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.880]   of software written today that will take advantage of it.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.640]   But for me, and once again, everybody comes at this from their own perspective, as an
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.560]   aperture user, as a guy that uses Pro Tools with 99 plugins all the time, I need as much
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.720]   RAM as I can get and I need as much firepower as I can get.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.560]   And those applications will talk to the stuff that's going on at the MacPro.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.400]   What's particularly interesting is the amount of addressable RAM these new machines will
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.160]   have in them.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.440]   That's awfully important to somebody that's doing stuff like I'm doing or like Alex is
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   doing.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:41.240]   And I do think it's going to be a while before most of the applications catch up to the real
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.440]   power of these things.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.280]   But you know how programmers are, they're going to say, "Oh, well, everybody's got
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.040]   8 gigs of RAM now."
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.120]   And if you don't have 8 gigs of RAM, you're going to have trouble running Word in about
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   three years.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:24:00.800]   And I will say the one thing that I specifically use on my G5, actually, not the MacPro yet,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.800]   but is aperture.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.920]   Of all the applications that I use, if you're using that, I mean, I don't even...
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.520]   Can I sound like an idiot?
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   Is it aperture dead?
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   Didn't they fire the team?
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.520]   No.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.720]   I think we're just going to kill aperture.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   Quit it.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.480]   I know you wrote a book and everything's gotten.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.560]   You're running the website.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.560]   But come on.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.600]   Well, first of all, they did not fire the team.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.600]   Let's get that started.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.600]   Who did they fire?
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.600]   They didn't fire anything.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600]   They didn't fire anybody.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.520]   They took guys out of the final cut group.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.680]   They borrowed them.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   They did some stuff for the aperture.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   So they reassigned the aperture team.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.960]   They just put them back where they got them.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.720]   So who's writing aperture?
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.040]   They brought in a new development team.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   Okay.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.200]   So they didn't fire them.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.120]   So my understanding is that the team that is currently working on a lot of the stuff is
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:50.480]   the guys, some of the motion guys and shake guys and stuff like that that are making...
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.040]   But is it Lightroom really a better app?
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.040]   No, it's a dog.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.040]   Okay, good.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.960]   I wanted to hear you say that.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   It's...
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.920]   Now I want to say in Lightroom's defense, it's getting better and better and it's still
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.320]   in beta and I haven't been privileged to see beta 4 but my friend Derek Story has it.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.760]   He said it's really good.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.760]   I suspect that Lightroom is going to be a good application but it is simply if you use aperture
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.360]   and you use Lightroom and it's present configuration, use them side by side, you just run back to
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.160]   aperture and I'll tell you how much...
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   It's not buggy though.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.160]   People say it's buggy.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.560]   Yeah, well, you know, I'm sorry but it's really not.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.920]   It's just they don't know how to use it because they try to treat it like Photoshop and it's
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.560]   not going to act like Photoshop because it's not Photoshop.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.880]   And if you pay attention in about a month or so, Leo, you're going to find out how not
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.760]   that it is because we're going to see version 1.5 or 2.5.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.840]   Well, and that's the other thing that may be announced on Tuesday.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:46.160]   There's certainly some buzz that maybe CS3 will come out way early and we'll see an Intel
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.160]   Photoshop.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.080]   Any credence to that?
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.080]   I'd be surprised.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.680]   Mostly the room I'd be really surprised.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680]   I'd be really surprised.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:59.120]   I mean, it may happen but the rumors are the reject free for CS3 is, you know, March.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.480]   I mean, those are pretty strong rumors.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.480]   Okay.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.840]   So where I saw this then maybe I'm mistaken.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.200]   If they could speed it up, those could be inaccurate rumors but that's the...
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   You would never know.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   You know, they...
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   Photoshop world's going on right now and if they...
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   That's where you'd announce it, yeah.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   Yeah, that's where you'd announce it.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   Yeah, that's where you'd announce.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   All they did was show Lightroom 4.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   That was their big deal.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   Okay.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   Yeah, so...
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.200]   The Mini is updated too.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:27.080]   No more cost course solo in any form at all on the Mac which is good because I think they
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.120]   were about one of the three companies selling core solos.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.280]   Nobody wants a core solo.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   Core Duo's not any more expensive.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.160]   When you look at the value, I mean, a little mini now is pretty...
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.680]   I have a core Duo Mini I'm very happy with, you know.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.520]   After saying I want a Mac Pro, you know, I'm not so unhappy with it.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.040]   The Mini to be honest with.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.040]   Well, it was replaced.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   You know what it replaced?
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.040]   It replaced the Cube.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.040]   Oh my gosh.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.040]   It was a lot faster.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.040]   I love the Cube.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   I think the Cube is a beautiful...
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.600]   Yeah, I got that and my Hendrix posters and I'm just...
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.000]   I got a little room I'm making.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.480]   It's got a orange shag carpet.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.220]   It's a little bit stealy dance.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.000]   So happy.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.960]   Parallels updated and finally works with the Mac Pro and now Parallels is using the built-in
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:15.520]   Intel VT hardware which means I understand that you're going to get performance almost
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.160]   identical to that of what you'd get on bootcamp.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.680]   In other words, full hardware performance out of Parallels.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.240]   Is there full support for the graphics cards now within Parallels?
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.240]   That I don't know.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   I haven't actually downloaded it.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   That's been the issue.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.040]   It does support the...
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.520]   No, bootcamp supports the eyesight.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.520]   So that's good news.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.520]   I think that's just...
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.760]   You know, all of this stuff is driver issues, right?
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.080]   So I would imagine...
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.320]   I mean, I haven't tried the new Parallels but I'd imagine that that would be part of the
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   deal.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.800]   Because that's what I've been going back and forth.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   I love Parallels.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   I love boot camping.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.600]   Yeah, I mean, but again, you have different needs.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.560]   Certainly, if you have to get all the power out of your hardware, boot camp is probably
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.440]   it, but they're getting closer and closer.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.680]   And of course, VMware is doing a version for the Mac 2.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   And I just...
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.840]   To me, man, that is...
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.000]   We're even looking at call for help.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.840]   We're looking at buying a Mac Pro and running our Windows.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.680]   All our Windows software on the Pro in virtualization.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.680]   Right.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.160]   It just makes sense.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.600]   And I think that's going to be the...
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.160]   That's going to be the...
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.200]   As this really starts to stabilize when you're really able to use Windows in that type of
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.320]   environment, you know, it's just really hard to justify why you would buy a...
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   You know, something other than...
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   Well, there's a Dell.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.320]   It looks pretty nice.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.320]   There's a Dell.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.400]   The new Dell XPS 700 is a very slick looking machine.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   I mean...
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.240]   It's a slick looking machine, but you're still limiting yourself.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.240]   If you want...
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   Well, I can't run a Mac on it.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   Well, yeah.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   And no one's going to argue that...
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.000]   I mean, people will argue, but they're wrong.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.840]   If they start saying that you can do the same audio, you know, any kind of match to iMovie,
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.840]   iDVD...
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   No, I agree.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.240]   You know, all that stuff that...
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.080]   Windows is not good for that kind of content creation.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.840]   Yeah, and so you want a little bit of both.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.840]   I mean, you might...
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.840]   But there are things that, for instance...
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.840]   You know, we're recording this.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.840]   I hate to admit it.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.080]   On Adobe Audition, on a Windows machine.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   I am anyway.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.720]   I don't know what you're recording it on.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:10.560]   But to me, you know, there are still some applications that run best on Windows, including
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.560]   most games.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.560]   Right.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.080]   In fact, Dell, that's what Dell's looking at.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080]   They're saying the games market.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.400]   Michael Dell just said, talking at the gaming conference in Austin said the games are going
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.800]   to be the biggest business of all.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.080]   He's pushing Dell in that direction.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.000]   And he's smart because that's the one advantage now Windows has.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.560]   Well, that's what it has, but the thing is, is you get that advantage when you buy Apple
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.560]   hardware.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:35.160]   You know, I don't know if you're a gamer that you would buy a Mac and boot to run bootcamp
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.160]   to run games.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   I just...
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   Right.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.160]   I don't know if a gamer's going to go that way.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   Well...
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   You're only a gamer.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.960]   If, frankly, a lot of the reason people still play PCs in the home anyway is for gaming.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.200]   Not in business, but in the home is for gaming.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   Right.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.880]   One more story about the MacBook.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.600]   Apple admits it.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.600]   Yes.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.920]   There are some shutdown problems.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.720]   And if you're having a...
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.120]   You should call this...
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.120]   It's genius.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   It's true.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.920]   So it's a faulty heatsink.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.520]   And I actually know two people that are already having that problem.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.520]   I feel so lucky.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.520]   I'm getting off.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.520]   So, Scott, you've had no problems with your MacBook.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.960]   Well, no, I have a MacBook Pro.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   Oh, you have a Pro?
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   I have a book.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.040]   Just see, I bought the MacBook Pro when it first came out and I've never had the wine
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.600]   or the moon or anything that you're supposed to have happened to that.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.720]   And I do know some people had trouble with the MacBook, but we talked about while you
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.360]   were gone, Leo, one very interesting statistic.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.440]   Even with all the reported problems, it appears that Apple cannot supply enough computers
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.160]   to meet the demand for that thing.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.240]   Well, that's good news.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:40.360]   I guess, although if half of them come back as a discolored wrist rests, I do...
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:46.760]   I'd have to say both Amber MacArthur and Chonka Brothers are called for help bought white
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.760]   MacBooks and they're discolored.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:54.040]   I mean, within a month, noticeable yellowing on the trackpad and on the wristpad.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.000]   And I'll tell you, I'd be pissed.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.360]   Do they need to say rich Canadian food?
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.680]   You know, Poutine and MacBooks do not go together, folks.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.440]   Please step away from the Kurds.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.280]   And I don't mean the Iraqi Kurds, the Kurds and way Kurds.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.440]   Have you ever had Poutine?
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.840]   Merlin, you've had Poutine.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.600]   No, when we were in Vancouver, we went to some kind of a very odd Indian, uh, lenitive
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.600]   restaurant.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.640]   Oh, curry's bad for your MacBook, too.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.080]   No, not that kind of the native, native, uh, native Canadians.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.120]   Oh, first Americans.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.600]   Yeah, and it was a lot of, I think it was...
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   First Nations.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   Yeah, there you go, exactly with the big, uh, yeah, the totem poles and whatnot.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.240]   I'm sorry, that's for Alex.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   That's for Alex.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   I had to translate.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   Fuck.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   It's not fun.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   All of a sudden, we're Don Rickles.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.240]   You're gonna play this...
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   Hey, you got the guy from Zimbabwe over here.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   Yeah, yeah, put your hand in clap.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.040]   Go ahead, you had native First Nation food.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.040]   No.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.040]   And it was good.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.440]   Um, well, I, I, I basically, I just wanted to go on, uh, on record a thing.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.720]   I had a MacBook Pro and I, I do get, I've recently gotten the whining and a little bit
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.040]   of the clanging and sounds like there might be a very...
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   Tling-free.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.040]   What clanging?
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.040]   I never heard of clanging.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.440]   Well, it's kind of like, it's like it, if there was some kind of a very tiny little Dutch
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.440]   windmill in there.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   And it was maybe...
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.440]   And San Francisco treat.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.480]   You can imagine a little, a little shoes.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.480]   Does it have a little shoes?
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.480]   Tling-ing.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   There's a little clap.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   Yeah, you know, actually Alex, there's a little clappy sound too.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.480]   So I...
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   Oh, there you go.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.280]   But you know, it, it kind of keeps me company.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.280]   So I...
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   What's the mooing sound like?
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.280]   I've never heard it.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   Is it really sound like a moo?
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.360]   I've never heard it either.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   I have a moo.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.500]   You know, the thing is, okay, well, Donna, completely separate note.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.500]   I've had this crazy thing happen with my keychain lately, where security D and kernel
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.960]   tasks just go through the roof.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.720]   And I can hear this thing just where it's grabbing about a mmm, 1.7 gigs of RAM for each of those
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.920]   processes of virtual RAM.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.920]   Wow.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.920]   And it's like...
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   That'll slow things down.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.640]   Yeah, you know, this thing so quick silver is not as responsive when there's like negative
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.640]   RAM available.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.640]   So no, but that's...
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.840]   It was interesting because I started to hear what people were talking about with some
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.640]   of these heating up issues and the noise issues because you can definitely hear it.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.800]   In your case though, it also sounds like a software issue.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.120]   But I think that a lot of this stuff is actually software issues.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:16.680]   Yeah, actually I've been holding off hoping against hope that 10, 4, 8 will be coming out
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.680]   pretty soon with some fixes.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.040]   Yeah, there's a lot of little weird...
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.120]   Once you start spending some time on the forums over on the Apple boards, you start realizing
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.360]   there's a lot of voodoo going on between releases that people are waiting for.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.360]   Anybody...
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.040]   Everybody's applied the upwards of the SMC, what do they call it?
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.680]   The update, the firmware update that fixed the fan.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.680]   That seems to...
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   That seems to...
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   Didn't bother me.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   You didn't see it.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.680]   But I wasn't having any mooing.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   I haven't got...
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   Tell me about this mooing.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   What is...
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   They call it, but I don't know what it sounds like.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   It's some sort of wine or moo.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   You've got a clang.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   I don't think a clang could be called a moo.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.920]   No, like a metallic windmill.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.920]   Yeah, my only issue.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.640]   And you know, I swap batteries a lot because I have a lot of extra batteries.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.040]   And the biggest problem I've had with my G4, if I just close it and put it to sleep, I
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.480]   can just swap the battery.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:11.320]   And with my Macbook Pro, if I do the same thing, it just turns off.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.320]   So like...
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.400]   So did you tell Virgin when you got on with your forbidden Macbook that you also have
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.480]   eight lithium-ion batteries in your...
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.880]   I was only carrying three extras.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.880]   So...
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.960]   I mean, you could have blown the whole thing out of this...
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   I could have.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.960]   I could have.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.960]   I was practically a walking terrorist by myself.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   Oh my God.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960]   And I had toothpaste.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   Oh my God.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   I did.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   I did.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   I forgot about it.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.280]   I was just lucky you're with us today.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.160]   I mean, you could be in Gitmo right now.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.760]   We said we don't know what happened to Alex.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.080]   He disappeared three years ago.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.000]   He's not telling you the whole story, Leo.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   I had to go bail him out.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.960]   And I was carrying tea from Zimbabwe, which is technically against the...
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.440]   Yeah, it's agricultural products.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.920]   Yeah, but it's really good tea.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.840]   I have no idea you were so antisocial.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.400]   He's a really awful person.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.400]   I'll tell you what.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:05.240]   Cory Doctorow hands out a metal bill of rights card that you're supposed to carry with you
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.720]   through the metal detector when it goes off and they search you and they find the metal
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   bill of rights.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.360]   You're supposed to say, "Oh yeah, the bill of rights, perhaps you've heard of it."
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.960]   Yeah, because based on a lot of the people I meet that work for TSA, they have a very
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.960]   elevated sense of humor.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   I think that would really...
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.560]   I find them just jolly, jolly folk.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.840]   So we will be doing live coverage from live.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.360]   Semi-live, I don't know.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.160]   We might get it out next week, the week after coverage of the Showtime event.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.600]   Actually, I'll be there.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.200]   And what am I supposed to do, Alex?
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.920]   Run over to the set and record.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:41.920]   No, no, no.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.120]   We're going to shoot it on the set there.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.120]   I mean, we'll shoot it around it.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.480]   We're just going to go ahead with the TV.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.000]   So whatever is announced, we will have a coverage, instantaneous coverage that will
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.800]   be up on the site that day.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.840]   Yeah, yeah, well, it has to be.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.360]   We have editors standing by.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.720]   We have everybody ready to go.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.480]   Well, I'm not going to edit this.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.720]   Every single bit of this is going on the air.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.360]   And I'm going to get it to you right now so we can put it right up on the site.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.760]   So this news will be hot and nobody can mock our prognostications.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.240]   We're ready.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   All right.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.200]   MerlinMan43folders.com.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.760]   I love you, MerlinMan.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.760]   I love you.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.760]   I love your folders.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.400]   I love your text expander.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.720]   I love, I love dino-matic.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.720]   Dino-matic is...
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   Tell me about dino-matic.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.080]   Well, you know, I posted this on 43folders just the other day.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.320]   I don't have, personally, I don't have a whole lot of use for Dashboard.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.840]   It's just cute and it's fun.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.320]   I use the confabulator.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.560]   I like the confabulator.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   But even...
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.000]   I mean, just this is just one data point.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.080]   It's never really done it for me.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   But I finally...
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.080]   I had a business use.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.600]   I really wanted to find some way to pick a random restaurant.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.760]   So my wife and I didn't just stand around and stare at each other all night until you
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.920]   starved to death.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.160]   And so this lets you in and run a bunch of local restaurants in your neighborhood and
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.800]   what kind of cuisine they are.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.080]   And you spin the little wheel around and it spits out the restaurant that you're going
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   to go to.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.080]   And it's totally fun and it works great.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.920]   And if you work someplace where you're always going out to eat, you'll never have to argue
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.320]   about this stuff again.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.320]   And here it's...
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.320]   It's...
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.320]   It's...
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   When somebody writes...
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   It sounds like this.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.320]   Can you hear that at all?
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.320]   I don't know if you can hear that.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   I hear some Dutch people.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   I actually hear some yodeling.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.880]   No, they're holding back the diet.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.880]   But it's a lot of fun.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.880]   Here it is.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.880]   I'm doing it right now.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   Got it?
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]   There's the...
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880]   Oh, it's like a slot machine.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   Oh, that's fun.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880]   That's what the audience can.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   It's like you put a quarter in and it goes...
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   That's what you're hearing.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   That's the Dutch windmill.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   I can hear it.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   I can hear it.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.880]   Oh my God.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.880]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.880]   I look at you.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.720]   This whole time it's dynamatic.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.440]   When somebody writes the history of the decline and fall of the American people, dynamatic
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:51.040]   will figure large, I think, in the first signs of the end.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   Really?
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.200]   Yeah, I'm just throwing that out there.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.520]   I mean, talk about a plate.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.120]   I mean, look, you just came back from Zimbabwe, Alex.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.520]   Is this an issue in Zimbabwe?
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.000]   Like, oh, gosh, so many restaurants, I can't think of which one to go to.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.640]   Maybe I'll use a dashboard widget on my $2,000 computer to tell me what restaurant to go
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.640]   to.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.160]   Said the guy who can't decide if he needs a MacBook on top of his...
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.360]   Like, I just want a 30-inch display.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.720]   A display bigger than the home of most of the Zimbabweans.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.720]   Leo, this is what...
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.160]   Yeah, mostly we're worried about whether the electricity will be on when we get to it.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.560]   This is what my friend Erica at Mule Design calls a first-world problem.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.200]   It is a first-world problem.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.880]   Can't decide which one could we be portion restaurant to go to.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   I'm hungry.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.600]   I don't know what to eat.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.720]   You have to rely on chance in order to decide where you're going to have lunch.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.080]   You've got the right kind of problem.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:49.000]   I do have to do it when you come back after spending a couple weeks in Africa, you tend
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.280]   to come back and it is very hard to listen to people complain.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.680]   Yeah, it's a different world.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.200]   But fortunately, we live in this one.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.600]   So too bad.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.000]   Does that sound callous and cold to me?
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.600]   Yeah, it was a little callous and cold.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.080]   It's a little callous and cold.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   Maybe talking that funny voice again.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   Which funny voice?
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.080]   I can't tell which one you're talking.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.320]   Well, just notice the postmark for all the letters and where all the letters are being
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   dropped.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.600]   Yeah, just send your mail to Alex@typicsacort.com.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   You're so fired.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.560]   Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.360]   Scott Bourne can be found online everywhere.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.840]   Of course, the iLife Zone, pretty much everywhere.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.560]   The iLife Zone is a great place to start.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.080]   Any other site you'd like to plug, Scott, your app at your site?
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.520]   You know, Aputure Tricks is doing well, but probably my favorite site to hang out on lately
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.520]   has been the podcastingtricks.com.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.520]   I've been happy.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520]   Oh, that's new.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.520]   I haven't heard about that.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.520]   That's great.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.400]   Yeah, we're doing about 20,000 unique IPs a day, having a lot of fun.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.880]   So everything you'd ever want to know about making a program as exciting and thrilling
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.600]   as this would be there.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   Well, we're going to use this one sort of as an example of what not.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   Okay, good.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   Good stuff.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.640]   I'm just glad I could help.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.520]   All right, and Alex Lindsey at PixelCore.com.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.360]   Alex, of course, is the evil genius behind all of this.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.080]   There would be no back break.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.680]   So please do write to him because it's not my fault.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   It really is him.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:23.120]   Look, let's have one last spin of the dynomatic before we go because guys, I think it's time
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.880]   for a Merlin to buy dinner.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.880]   Okay.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   Okay.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.600]   We're out of here.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   We need a tagline.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.120]   I can't say another Mac break weekly is in the can.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.120]   It doesn't...
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   No.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.120]   It doesn't...
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   So long suckers.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:40.360]   You bought a Mac and so long.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   Yes.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.480]   I just came up with the one for the I-Lives, though, after eight shows.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.840]   And what's that for the other one?
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   I haven't heard it yet.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.800]   Don't get caught without a little zone.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.360]   I like that.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.360]   I like that.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.920]   What are we going to say?
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.600]   Mac break weekly.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.880]   It's an easier way to choose where you're going to eat than dynomatic.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   How about M-W-W?
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.680]   M-B-W, we ain't got no move.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.800]   How about Mac break weekly?
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.000]   We'll put it up when we're good and ready.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.760]   And on that note, good night, everyone.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   [Music]
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.760]   (upbeat rock music)
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.760]   (upbeat rock music)
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   (upbeat rock music)

[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   (upbeat rock music)
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   (upbeat rock music)
