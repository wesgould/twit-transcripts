[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.440]   Alex Lindsey dials in from Rwanda
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.280]   to talk about all the Mac news, the new iPad commercial,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.600]   the new Mac probe, and why Google bought Nest and not Apple.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.800]   It's all coming up next.

[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.280]   And you're not going to hear from the Chicago Sun
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.960]   times and the celestial.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.160]   Waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.120]   And there he is with Mr. Teller.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.280]   Now come on, is that at the Wax Museum?
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.880]   No, no, that's Pendulate.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.960]   And that's about as--
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.040]   I mean Pendulate, yeah.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.200]   And unless you're running 6365, that's
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.400]   about as good as photos you're going to get next to them.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.200]   There is a disparity in size.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.720]   But I--
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.320]   A little bit.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.360]   I could scroll out a little bit to show you the whole photo,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.880]   but that really is the operative.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.080]   I love it.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.080]   I love it.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.960]   They do a meet and greet after their show at the Rio.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.560]   Anybody wants to say hello?
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.240]   And I think that if you were to rent an Apple box or milk crate
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.480]   to people who were taking pictures with Penn,
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.560]   you would probably be worth a good price back times too.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   Does Teller go too to these meet and greets?
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.160]   Yeah, yep.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.600]   Does he speak?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.440]   Indeed he does.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.240]   He just doesn't speak on stage.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.880]   Well, actually, I don't want to give anything away.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.760]   But you might hear him speak at some point in the show.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.560]   When we were in Vegas, because Andy and I hung out
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.280]   a little bit after New Media Expo,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.360]   you were debating whether you should go to see the Penn
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.000]   and Teller show.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.960]   And obviously, you did the right thing.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.960]   Yes.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.360]   It's like-- again, I'm a freelance journalist
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.760]   in a rapidly collapsing market that I had to.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.920]   It's more like you know exactly to the penny what your impulse
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.240]   by level is.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.960]   And if it's above that, you have to go, well, deep down,
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.760]   I knew I was going to go.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.320]   But I knew that my father's voice would not
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.120]   leave my head unless I spent at least two days thinking,
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.280]   yeah, but OK, well, what if we spent the money on this instead?
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.960]   We got to eat here and there, there, there, there.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.880]   Yeah, money will spend.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.200]   If you any time you're in through or over Vegas,
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.840]   definitely check out the Penn and Teller show,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.400]   because even as a longtime fan who had seen a lot of the different shows
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.560]   before, it was just fantastic.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.840]   Was it really expensive?
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   It was--
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Was it hundreds of dollars?
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.720]   Here I am sitting in front of a Mac Pro.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.200]   I should not be asking that question.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.800]   Well, no, no, because now you should be asking that question,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.840]   because now that you have a Mac Pro, you have no money left.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.240]   Exactly right.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.400]   It's not that expensive.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.840]   Well, it was like $116, which is--
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.840]   yeah, I mean, that's more money.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.880]   That's more money than I like to spend on one unit of entertainment.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.480]   But again, I'm a big fan.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.040]   And again, I'm in Vegas.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.360]   I figured that that was the money that I would have lost
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.000]   had I done any gambling whatsoever.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.800]   And so instead of just 45 minutes of losing money
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.920]   and feeling like an idiot, at least I spent the money on something
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.560]   that I got a unit of entertainment out of.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.880]   Well, I'm glad you got a full unit.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.320]   A full unit of entertainment.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.760]   Also here with us, it's Mr. Renee Richie, but also back from Vegas.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.760]   You guys did a great job up there on the stage with the Callie
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.160]   Lewis of Geek Beaten.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.240]   That looked like a lot of work.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.240]   I have a new found respect for what you do, Leo.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.600]   It is so difficult to sit there and just do this for that many hours.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.960]   Tell me about it.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.280]   I'm lucky I get to do two hours here quickly and then leave.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.240]   But doing that all day, every day--
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.800]   Let me just ask, was the base rumble
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.480]   booth right there next to you as it has been in years past?
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.000]   What was it called?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.480]   Earthquake.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.080]   Earthquake.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.080]   It was there.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.880]   It was right there.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.640]   It was deafening at times.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.080]   It's a really nice combination.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.160]   Fortunately, at least with R-Mikes--
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.960]   I don't know about your mikes.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.200]   They roll off at below 40 hertz.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.920]   So you don't--
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.880]   You can feel it more than me.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.120]   Feel it, but you don't hear it.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.200]   Now, I see that Mr. Alex Lindsey has joined us,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.480]   but I'm not sure from where.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.800]   Last I saw was a picture of you in Hotel Rwanda having
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.600]   a lovely breakfast.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.440]   Are you still in Co. Golly?
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440]   I am.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.080]   I'm in the kind of the office of the school right now.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.120]   So everyone has gone.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.160]   I just finished a class.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.040]   And yeah, I'm staying at the Mecoline, which
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.640]   is known as Hotel Rwanda.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.960]   Yeah, what a beautiful picture.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.560]   Somebody on the--
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.000]   Somebody on your Google+ said, you are single-handedly,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.680]   all by yourself, revising my opinion of Rwanda.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.440]   Well, I hope so.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.120]   I'm not hoping that I'm single-handedly doing it,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.000]   but I think that I've been blown away,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.400]   because it's not something that I expected when I first
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.200]   came here.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.480]   Before we decided to work in Rwanda,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.320]   I came twice by myself just to kind of see what was going on
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.080]   and see what was actually happening.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.360]   And I spent a lot of time researching it
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.720]   before we committed to it.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.160]   And I've just blown away.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.000]   I mean, I'm sitting in Rwanda with a pretty good connection.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.400]   But it just grows so fast.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.000]   And Rwanda is kind of like Dubai, where they just tear an entire block
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.280]   down and put up a new whole new set of buildings.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.000]   And it's happening.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.600]   So every time I come, it's like a different city.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.440]   And I keep on getting lost.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.840]   Look at this picture I have on the screen of--
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.280]   this is Alex's breakfast.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.880]   It looks pretty nice.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.400]   Yeah, I was fortunate.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.200]   I got up.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.600]   Since, of course, my sleep schedule's all off.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.680]   I got up right and early.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.720]   So I get up early pretty most of the time.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.120]   But I was very early, so I was able to see it
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.120]   and have my little coffee.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.760]   So it was great.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.680]   And you have so much bandwidth there.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.240]   What is-- I mean, it looks like a high-def picture here.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.120]   We have at the school, especially in the evening,
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.720]   when we're not competing with anything else,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.920]   we get about 50 megs up and down.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.440]   I was complaining about it during the day.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   And I was reminded by my partner here,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.640]   the government partner that we have the fifth--
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.240]   I think the fifth fastest connection in the country.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.040]   So it's not that everybody has 50 megs, but we do.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.960]   So we teach the school, the African Digital Media Academy.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.360]   We actually are teaching classes from California
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.080]   and other parts of the United States in Kigali.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.800]   So we actually-- the instructors are in the United States
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.520]   and the students are in Kigali.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.280]   So we've been experimenting with that last year.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   That's what the whole curriculum is going to be based on this year.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.600]   And so I'm down here just making sure
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.720]   that all the technical stuff is all set to make that transition
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.840]   over the next two or three months.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.440]   Awesome.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.200]   Well, it's great to have all three of you.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.480]   From Montreal, from Kilgali, from--
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.920]   I don't know-- some small town in Rhode Island.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.080]   And here we are in Petalim.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.760]   Some of the chaters said, what does Leo need
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.000]   to studio for at all?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.600]   Because something has to stitch this all together.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.240]   And I think it's-- it's all virtual.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.800]   It's not quite as good as if one person's in a real spot.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.960]   Well, also, do you really, really, really
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.560]   want to have your business hinge on everybody's Skype
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.800]   connection working with you?
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.040]   No.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.720]   There you go.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.200]   Lately, Skype has been a bear.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.840]   Somebody emailed me, though, and said, you know what's happening?
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.800]   You're being DDoS.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   You're being Skype-dossed.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.760]   And this apparently-- Chad, you might know this-- happens
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.960]   on twitch.tv all the time.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.480]   The griefers will come in.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.120]   And if they can deduce what your Skype handle is,
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.760]   they just kind of bombard you.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.320]   And so the trick is to use a non-guessable Skype handle,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:44.920]   I guess.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.280]   Right.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.360]   I know that Brian was hitting that issue a lot.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.720]   And he had to come up with--
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.320]   Brushwood.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.240]   Brushwood, yeah.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.760]   And he was coming up with different user names every week.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.560]   And we emailed back and forth.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.480]   You know, if we came up with a 10-digit number--
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.480]   Yeah, pseudo-random.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.440]   Nobody's going to guess it.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.400]   If they see it on the screen, we'd have to get a new one.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.280]   I think we'll probably try that.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.920]   But yeah, Twitch apparently is a big problem on twitch.tv.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.720]   So the internet, once again, a place
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.520]   where nice people gathered it, share ideas.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.840]   So the big story is sort of a Mac story,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.280]   sort of not an Apple story.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.520]   Tony Fadel, who was a vice president in charge of iPod,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.240]   commonly, mistakenly, credited with designing the iPod.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.840]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.640]   Although there is a famous scene, is it
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.960]   in Isaac's autobiography?
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.680]   Stephen Levy refers to it where Fadel
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.480]   comes into the room to present the idea of the iPod
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.480]   to Steve Jobs and has all the components on the table
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.040]   and snaps them together and says, here,
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.400]   with little jobs like showmanship.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.080]   And that was apparently the thing that convinced Jobs.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.160]   Yeah, we should probably be doing this product.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.720]   Fadel founded a company called Nest with Matt--
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.400]   what's his last name?
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.920]   Rogers?
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.920]   I can't remember his last name.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.800]   And raised around 100, it sounds like $150 to $200 million
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.440]   to create a very interesting learning thermostat.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.080]   And more recently, a talking smoke alarm.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.280]   And Google just bought him yesterday for $3.2 billion
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.200]   in cash-- $3.2 billion in cash.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.040]   That's 5.8% according to GigaOM, 5.8% of Google's cash
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.120]   position.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.640]   So no matter what you think about that number,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.440]   it is a significant number for both Google and obviously
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.080]   for Tony.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.400]   It's a big thing.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.640]   Google Ventures owned part of it,
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.960]   so I'm guessing some of that was just bank account movement.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.040]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.600]   Yeah, Google Ventures, an early investor in this,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.400]   they saw right away the value of Nest.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.720]   The question a lot of people asked right away is, why not Apple?
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   Do you think Apple wanted to--
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.400]   I was kind of surprised that Apple--
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.600]   I just assumed that Apple eventually was going to buy Nest.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.840]   It was the Apple of other things.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.880]   And it was surprising that to me that Google beat them to it.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.280]   There's got to be somebody that Apple's just going,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.720]   oh, I can believe that.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.680]   Three nots.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.600]   Apple usually is very careful about verticals that they pick.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.960]   And they simply might not believe that they're
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.560]   ready to enter into the home automation or home device
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.320]   vertical.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.680]   They usually do one thing.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.600]   They sort of annexing things that are next to it.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.640]   And this is several orders down the line.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.520]   Even if you count in watches and televisions,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.880]   it's probably a while before they want
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.560]   to get to intelligent devices, if at all.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.360]   Because maybe iOS in the car will become iOS in the house,
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.040]   iOS on the camera everywhere.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.000]   But it's also possible Tony Fadel doesn't fit into Apple's
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.760]   new leadership.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.760]   And Tim Cook has shown that he would rather have a cohesive team
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.920]   than just all star players on that team.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.880]   And also, it's kind of hard to even imagine how Google is
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.040]   going to fit into Google's portfolio,
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.360]   apart from the idea of observing your movements
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.880]   through the house and being able to learn from you
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.200]   from your position there.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.080]   It would be an odd thing for Apple to have bought.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.320]   Philosophically, they were very, very Apple-like company.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.560]   When you read the press releases pre-acquisition,
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.760]   there is a lot about the magic and life, and saving the planet.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.640]   They really were pressing very, very hard.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.720]   This isn't just a thermostat that will pay for itself
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.840]   because of the way that it adjusts your heating
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.200]   and cooling settings.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.560]   This is a device that will help to heal the planet
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.920]   because it will reduce our dependency on greenhouse emissions
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.520]   in the four-hour or two.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.760]   Survive the next thousand years.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.800]   We're going to need a blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.960]   That's, by the way, John Doar bit big on it
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.760]   with the Kleiner Perkins because they were better than on CleanTech.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.120]   None of the Kleintech investments that they had
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.120]   did very well until now.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.240]   So I'm sure that in the halls of Kleiner Perkins,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.440]   there's like, yes.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   Yes.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:42.960]   Yes.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.560]   Everyone's bathing in champagne.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.560]   But you do have to--
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.120]   it almost feels like Apple is more judicious
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.680]   with its acquisitions and that this is for Google
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.360]   almost silly money.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.560]   Yeah, 5.8%.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.960]   But for Apple, it's really silly money.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.440]   Oh, no, that's--
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:58.960]   I know.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   Apple has more cash than Google does, yeah.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.880]   They could have bought it and then
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.800]   spend another billion dollars on all other teams.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.280]   But they don't do that.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.640]   I know they don't do it, but I think
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.360]   that they should every once in a while because I think
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.640]   that this is-- the thing is, is I think what
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.960]   makes a lot of sense for Google is that they're
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.360]   the idea that your whole world--
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.880]   and I think that you get more sensitive to this
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.800]   when you wear glass a lot.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.440]   I'm not wearing it right now, but I do wear it a lot.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.640]   And you just kind of-- you want all of that information
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.160]   there.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.800]   So being tied into all the other things
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.320]   that you're doing with your--
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.520]   and tying that whole experience in so that you're
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.320]   in that environment.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.680]   Of course, the more they can keep you in that environment,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.200]   the better it is.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.440]   I don't think they necessarily need to know where your movements
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.080]   are or what temperature you're keeping your house.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.160]   But I think there's a lot of interest
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.320]   in having it where you don't have to look at another device
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.640]   or you don't have to think about something outside of your--
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.240]   and them having control of that process
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.960]   is, I think, very useful.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.560]   Apple already has a product team.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.800]   I mean, they have a fantastic team.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.960]   I think that's the point.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.960]   The iPhone and the iPod.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.520]   Google doesn't.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.760]   They have Motorola, which doesn't have a great product team.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.920]   Now they have one of the best guys in the world.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.560]   Apple's equivalent of this would be buying a fantastic server
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.920]   team, which they really need.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.200]   They do need that.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.920]   No, I think you nailed it.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.400]   Google gets out of this something it does not have,
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.080]   which is a consumer product division,
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.040]   a consumer product designers.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.240]   Apple's got that.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.840]   That's what Apple does.
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.960]   So there's less, I think, value in Nest to Apple,
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.960]   although there is underlying value to both Google and Apple
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.720]   in the intelligence of these devices.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.560]   And I think that that's something that perhaps doesn't get
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.520]   paid much attention to.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.560]   But really, Nest isn't about a thermostat or a smoke alarm.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.600]   It's about intelligence and intelligent devices in your home.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.840]   Well, I think that that's something
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.640]   we saw hints of at CES is that I don't think anybody--
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.760]   and I think this might be part of why Google's going down
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.440]   this path, but maybe not.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.440]   I don't think anybody really other than Nest
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.120]   has really figured out the internet of things very well.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.280]   So you look at-- you go to CES and you see a lot of misfires.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.120]   Misfire, misfire, misfire.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.240]   Weird protocol doesn't really work.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.320]   Hard to work with, hard to use.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.720]   Isn't going to work with anything else.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.080]   These are all the things that all I saw last week was just
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.480]   that, that, that, that, that.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.520]   And so Nest, and then you go, oh, this is great,
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.160]   and it just works, and it just does all those things.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.040]   And I think that-- but that is the future
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.960]   of every piece of electronics that we buy.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.440]   And anything that's got a chip in our house
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.360]   is going to have--
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.920]   is going to be like that eventually.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.520]   And Nest, I think, is ahead of everybody.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.560]   It's just hard to guess what the real reason for buying
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.880]   this company was.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.720]   Because 3.2 billion, that's a lot of money,
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.160]   even by Google standards.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.280]   That's a lot of money.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.680]   And if you were to go to the abstract and simply say
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.280]   that our company has a problem and that we don't understand
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.840]   how to make consumer electronics.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.400]   And not just things with keyboards and screens,
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   but things that are more uni-tasking, just one
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.520]   in every house, one in every room in the house sort of things.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.160]   We want to have that capability.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.120]   If you have a 3.2 billion dollar checkbook in which
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.880]   to solve that problem, it's interesting that they
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.480]   solve that problem by buying one company.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.640]   As opposed to simply saying, we're
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.960]   going to get these two hires, we're
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.560]   going to buy these four companies, we're
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.160]   going to buy this--
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.080]   Well, wait a minute, no.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.560]   --is the facility.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.960]   Because I don't think they're only going to buy one company.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.680]   It's of interest, and you raise that point.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.520]   Because I think this is the beginning of a buying
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.240]   spree for Google.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.680]   S-a-a-a-a-a.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.960]   Again, you start your spree with 3.2 billion dollars in cash.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   OK, it's like you to--
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.960]   It's like you to Tony Fidell's.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.960]   But they start with this.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.680]   It's like you bought the oil refinery before you bought the car.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   I admit it.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.520]   I feel like this is just gut instinct.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.400]   It feels to me as though there's something specific about this,
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.760]   not just this team of people, but this line of hardware.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.800]   Because it does not only-- not only
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.080]   does it-- is it a compelling consumer device,
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.440]   but it also is a sensor-based device.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.520]   I think that this is a vote for a sensor-based world in which
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.040]   you need to have real-time data being collected that you can
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.760]   then leverage into new software products and new hardware
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   products.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.080]   By the way, somebody in the chatroom asked,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.800]   this is 4.6 million allxes.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.720]   If that makes it easier for you to understand--
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.080]   It seems so much more affordable, though.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.080]   But I think that's--
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   I think that's--
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.080]   I think as well.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.760]   I think that they are buying into a company that has a lot of upside,
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.280]   too.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.080]   So you're not buying 3.2 billion just for--
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.000]   But they're not going to sell billions of dollars in nests.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.680]   Are they?
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.520]   No, but no.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.480]   But if you look at-- we don't know what kind of products they
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.720]   already have on-- I mean, obviously, they
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.800]   have a very large vision of where they want to go.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.920]   I mean, they're doing one thing at a time.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.800]   And at their size, they could only do one thing at a time.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.400]   The question is, is with Google money, with more engineering,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.280]   are they going to put out more products more quickly?
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.080]   And do they have five or six that are already close to the gate?
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.720]   That could be a whole nother thing that's there.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.160]   But I think that they could sell a lot of nests.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.440]   I mean, I think that there's still the market of people
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.080]   who have the disposable income, who would want a nest,
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.200]   is far from penetrated.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.680]   Far from saturated.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.480]   I was penetrated, and now I withdraw.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:03.880]   Oh, really?
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.760]   Yeah, I have two nests and decided not to install them
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.400]   in the new house.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.640]   Because-- well, first of all, there--
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.960]   I mean, machine intelligence on the thermostat
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.520]   is both overkill and impractical.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.920]   It was turning the thermostat on when it thought I was around.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.880]   You know, I mean, it's like--
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.120]   I don't-- my movements are not so predictable
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.840]   that a quote learning thermostat's
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.960]   going to learn anything.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.920]   And so it was turning on the heat at the wrong time, frankly.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.800]   It was too smart.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.160]   It was smart for us on good.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.360]   And I didn't see a lot of value to it.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.000]   Plus it's 250 smack-a-ra-lose.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   So--
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.640]   Well, love it.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.960]   I think it's important with this,
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.840]   is that Nest is a well-respected brand for geeks.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.800]   People love it.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.300]   Yes.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.160]   You've untold amounts of stories about people
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.240]   trying to install it.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.960]   It becomes something you follow your friends doing on Twitter.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.120]   And Android at home never really took off.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.480]   Google doesn't have a great brand for home electronics.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.000]   And they get Tony Fadel if they do
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   want to expand their product division.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.040]   It's a fantastic name to run that division
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.000]   or run home for Google in general.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.640]   Giga Oum's Malek of Giga Oum immediately interviewed Tony.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.640]   They have a good relationship, obviously.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.000]   And Tony said the thing that--
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.240]   I mean, there's no question why this is good for Nest.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.520]   But he said the interesting thing
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.760]   is that he can now go back to focusing on products
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.240]   and let Google help him scale.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.720]   Because one of the problems Nest was having
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.360]   was getting international.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.000]   He said, it's one in the UK, and it was a lot of work.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.440]   And that's just one country.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.160]   And we've got hundreds more to go.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.080]   So Google can scale them in ways
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.960]   that they couldn't with their existing infrastructure.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.520]   Well, and I think, again, once you have--
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.800]   for me, in my office, you start playing with Hue lights.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.960]   And once you start having that automation
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.560]   and being attached to your phone, I don't know.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.600]   I find it to be fairly--
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.320]   I could see Google buying the Hue division.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.800]   I could see not Phillips entirely, obviously.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.520]   It's too big a company.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.440]   But I could see them buying the Hue division.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   And I think there's lots of other smart home connected
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.600]   devices, internet of things, companies
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.720]   that Google is probably looking at.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.440]   I feel like Google's bought eight robotics companies
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.640]   for Andy Rubin in 2013.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.360]   I could see Google buying eight connected home companies
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:16.800]   in this year.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.440]   Offering a unified offering, which would be very convenient.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.440]   And that's what's missing, right?
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.840]   I'd be much more interested than Nest
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.240]   if it wasn't just this island if it took to everything else.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.120]   And I think the part of the problem that stops me
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.160]   with a lot of home automation is there's Zigbee,
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.000]   and there's all these different protocols,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.400]   and all these different rules, and Quickie set
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.480]   is doing their own, and everybody's got their own little bits.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.800]   And so I'm like, I don't know which one to commit.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.560]   I'm literally-- I just don't know which one to commit to.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.400]   And I've been kind of sitting there going, I just wish--
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.080]   I have to admit, I was just like, I just wish Apple or Google
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.480]   or somebody would just pull this all together
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.320]   and tell me which one I should get that it will do all the things
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.520]   that I wanted to do.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.000]   It'll do it well, because a lot of them
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.280]   that are all these little bits, like this one part,
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.320]   like the lock works well.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.360]   But if you look at all the other things that they do,
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.240]   it doesn't work that well.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.560]   And so I don't want to compromise.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.680]   And so I've been kind of waiting out.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.000]   But I definitely want to automate my house.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And I think a lot of people want to automate their house.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.800]   I mean, once you start playing with it, again,
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.920]   it's like the next-- instead of getting sliders for your lights,
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.600]   now it's any color and being able to walk in your house
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.640]   without a key list existence.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.960]   Unfortunately, this is no longer an Apple story,
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.840]   because we've kind of wrapped up the part about why Apple didn't
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.600]   or wouldn't get them.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.920]   But Google does have Android at home.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.320]   This was their home automation initiative from about a year ago.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.360]   I think that you nailed it, that this is Google's big ambition
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.320]   to go into the home, which nobody has successfully done.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:39.840]   And--
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.480]   If they go into the car and into the home,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.680]   then they're pretty much--
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.880]   --and they got your glass.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.000]   They're pretty much at it all.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.720]   They got their whole existence all kind of tied
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.120]   into one big, one big, bow-wrapped thing.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.520]   And you don't have to drive anymore.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.520]   But it's around.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.320]   To get Apple back into the conversation,
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.160]   I think that when you're trying to figure out
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.520]   why they made this acquisition, Google
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.240]   is fundamentally a different company from Apple,
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.120]   where they really are more born out of university research
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.680]   than just in terms of corporate philosophy,
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.360]   in that they do believe that we're
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.240]   going to fund this idea because it's an interesting idea.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.840]   It seems to be related to what our larger goal is,
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.040]   but we're going to fund this because it's interesting.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.120]   Whereas Apple, you know that they're
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.640]   not going to put any product on the market.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.320]   They're not going to make any acquisition unless they are
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.600]   looking at the Lego fortress they built.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.560]   And they see the one red brick in the white wall.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.240]   And they say, we got to find something else
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.120]   to put into that hole right there.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.640]   So when they buy a sensor company,
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.040]   it's because they have a specific idea of, here's
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.960]   what feature that we want for the next iPhone.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.520]   And the only way we're going to be able to do it
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.360]   is to buy this company that has this technology for us.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.640]   Whereas there is at least a possibility that Apple--
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.200]   excuse me, that Google is saying we've got lots of money.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   We believe that home automation is going to be a thing.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.320]   We believe that sensor data is going to be a thing.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.040]   And we also believe that just in terms
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.920]   of intellectual curiosity, that the way
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.440]   that we can integrate our products much more conveniently
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.160]   into people's lives if these services have an awareness
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.640]   of their actual day-to-day activity.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.720]   So it may not be a specific hole in the wall
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.840]   they're trying to plug with this.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.640]   It might be that they believe that this is going
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.520]   to be an interesting market.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.000]   And they also just simply believe that it is OK for us
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.320]   to do something that is a little bit off of our direct path.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.240]   That's kind of how I feel.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.680]   As much as it is, it's still silly money.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.960]   It's more than they paid for YouTube.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.920]   It's more than they paid for YouTube.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.360]   But YouTube wasn't making money at the time they could.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.360]   The YouTube acquisition was clearly--
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.640]   this is going to hit big.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.240]   We can either buy it early for cheap,
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.640]   or we can buy it, or we can let it get into Facebook status
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.440]   in which now that it's worth $50 billion, there's no way
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.760]   we can simply buy our own social media network.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.080]   I think this is a different thing.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.520]   Again, $3.2 billion, that is--
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.040]   we all read lots of reports about acquisitions and money
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.000]   being moved from one column to another, as Renee suggested.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.880]   But $3.2 billion, when you can express any amount of money
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.280]   as a multiple percentage point of Google's money.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:12.800]   Right.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.440]   So that's a big frickin' check.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.920]   Not for us, Vegas on a table.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.440]   I really want to close this deal,
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.200]   but I'm going to have to call my spouse for approval
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.000]   on this check before I write it.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.280]   If you're building the Star Trek machine,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.200]   you're going to want to know what temperature it is in the room.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.840]   And that's their big dream, their big goals,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.120]   to make Star Trek a reality.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.040]   So they're going to--
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.720]   I think there's so many things involved.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.400]   The synergy of the product, the vision,
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.480]   the ability to get data out of your houses.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.320]   In many ways, this is a great fit for Google.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.200]   And I think the amount of money they paid for it
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.080]   to Andy's point shows that.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.080]   Yes, they dream of being Star Trek the next generation,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.080]   but turned out to be Star Trek Voyager.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.000]   I can't follow that.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.280]   That's just too perfect.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.440]   What we don't know, actually, is how much Google ventures
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.880]   investment was if they had 10%.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.800]   Then they saved $320 million on the deal.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.280]   Probably a successful year for them.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.080]   Well, it is.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.600]   It's interesting.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.200]   The two big investors, KP and Shasta,
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.400]   both basically are made whole by this.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.920]   That the Shasta fund is basically paid back.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.280]   And based on Nest alone, Kleiner Perkins
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.800]   I think generates a 20x return on their investment, which
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.760]   means that Kleiner returns over 60% of the fund
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.440]   with that Nest investment alone of its clean tech fund.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.680]   So that's how it works.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.800]   That's how venture capital works.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.080]   That's it?
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.720]   One big hit?
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.240]   You got 10 bad ones, one big one, you're set.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.160]   It's like the movie industry and Twit.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.400]   I put myself right in that category.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.720]   Anyway, enough said about that, but I
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.120]   thought a very interesting story.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.800]   And we will-- there'll be much more to say about it
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.000]   in time, including, of course, the big privacy question.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.520]   Do you really want a Google I in your house
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.200]   watching you as you wander?
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.480]   The O's at 60 degrees?
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.840]   The O's at 60 degrees?
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.640]   It doesn't bother me at all.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   But then I have a connect in my living room,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.200]   and I dance naked in front of it nightly.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.440]   So I guess--
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.200]   The NSA really doesn't like that, Leo.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.360]   I do it for the NSA.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.640]   I do it for them.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.040]   Our show today, Great Panel, as always.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.280]   I'm so glad Alex could join us from Rwanda, from Montreal,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.080]   Renee Ritchie of iMore.com.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.360]   Did you didn't get sick and see?
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.480]   Yes, did you?
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.840]   No, I have this thing where I just refuse to do it now,
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   and it seems to work.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.720]   The first couple of years I got the plague every time,
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   and then I thought it was silly.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.640]   We better stop doing this.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.240]   And so far, not what that works.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.720]   I think-- I know what happened.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.080]   None of the East Coasters could get there because of snow.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.320]   They're the ones that bring the disease.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.480]   We had people miss the show.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:43.960]   Like, they were--
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.800]   Lots of people.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.400]   They were canceled, and they only come in on Wednesday,
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.560]   and the show's over.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.800]   So they said, gave up?
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.760]   Those were the people who bring the disease.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.280]   It's like--
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.120]   I thought, mostly, when I stopped drinking like a fish
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.360]   and started sleeping normally.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.240]   You turned out to turn out that I liked it pretty much
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.880]   the same as it was at home.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.760]   Callie lost her voice, though, I think.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.680]   Yeah, she was breaking really hard.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.680]   Anyway, we're going to take a break.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.880]   Annie and I could also hear from the Chicago Sun
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.720]   Times.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.520]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.120]   And I got, yes, I have the Mac Pro, thanks to Ed Inger,
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:21.520]   who very kindly drove it up from Saratoga this week
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.120]   so that I could play with it.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.440]   I was wrong.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.240]   I'm just going to say that.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.480]   I was wrong about the Mac Pro.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.080]   This thing is sweet.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.640]   But first, word from legalzoom.com.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.880]   Legalzoom is not a law firm.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.640]   It's actually something much better.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.320]   Legalzoom helps you do the legal work
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.480]   you need to do to start your new business,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.640]   to protect your family, stuff that you don't need a lawyer
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.680]   to do.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.880]   It's self-help services.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.120]   You walk through this simple form of questionnaire
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:56.160]   on legalzoom.com, and they can help you create a will
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.520]   or start your own business.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.640]   They can help your New Year's resolutions come true.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.800]   That's really what Legalzoom is all about.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.240]   If you visit legalzoom.com, you'll
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.800]   see a huge variety of legal services that they can provide.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.440]   LLC, of course, is the one that set us up.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.360]   And back in 2005, and it was Kevin Rose,
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.240]   now Google Ventures, by the way, who said,
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.200]   Leo, I said, Kevin, I want to start a business.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.760]   He said, Leo, do you don't need a lawyer?
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.920]   Go to Legalzoom.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.560]   Get the back down, I think it was $50 or $60.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.320]   Now it's $99 plus filing fees.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.240]   I also got the trademark, the trademark at Legalzoom.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.720]   You can incorporate it if you want to do S-Corp or C-Corp.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.800]   You can even do that.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.120]   And what's nice is they give you this book.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.760]   It has all the paperwork, all the stuff you need.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.560]   It really sets you up.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.160]   You can decide what state you want to be in.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.440]   Look, if you don't have a last-willing testament,
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:53.840]   you must go right now and get that $69 last-willing testament.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.280]   The nice thing about Legalzoom, they now
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.880]   have the ability to get legal advice from an attorney
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.800]   in a pre-negotiated flat rate.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.920]   An attorney licensed in your state,
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.000]   you choose the attorney based on not only their profile,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.200]   but unedited reviews from Legalzoom customers.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.080]   Really, they do it all.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.280]   Personal services, business services, trademarks,
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.680]   and intellectual property, wills and trusts.

[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.840]   Andy and Naco Renee, Richie.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:18.720]   So how many MacPros did you order, Alex?
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.120]   I'm still trying to work out with our business rep,
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   the leasing.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.200]   It takes a while, right?
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.040]   They're not--
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.600]   Are they down to February now?
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   March?
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.840]   Yeah, I think February or March.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.320]   And it's mostly just sorting all of that.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.400]   We have a lot of computers on the lease,
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.520]   and so we're just trying to make sure that we can sort it all--
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.480]   sort it all through--
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:36.880]   So I was--
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.880]   We're probably going to get seven.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.960]   I was skeptical about the shape and the size.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.800]   I was wrong.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.120]   I mean, when I wanted to bring this in today,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.000]   just unplugged it, lifted it up.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   I carry it in one hand.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.800]   It is very fast.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.960]   It's beautiful, yes.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.040]   And by the way, I do have it on the desk,
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.440]   because it's smaller than you think.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.000]   I mean, it really isn't very big.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.840]   So I have it on my desk at home,
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.040]   hooked up to dual 27-inch monitors.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.440]   A couple of important points.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.800]   Besides the fact that you already know,
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.720]   it's very expensive and very fast.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.880]   It's as fast as it is expensive.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.920]   You're going to want expansion stuff.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.000]   And actually, I'm curious, Alex, what you're--
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.120]   there's a lot of Thunderbolt stuff out,
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.440]   which is really just repurposed USB 3.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.080]   In fact, I have two devices connected via USB 3.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.440]   You don't get all the bandwidth that you should get.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.000]   What you're looking for is a true Thunderbolt 2 device.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.280]   And there's a dearth of those, and they're very expensive.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.000]   One thing I saw on Apple's side, I think,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.440]   is a promised rate array that is truly Thunderbolt 2.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.240]   Otherwise, you're not going to get the throughput you want.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.640]   The other--
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.080]   Well, I mean, sometimes we're kind of throughput you need.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.280]   I mean, you know, I think that's--
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.840]   No, I'm using, for instance, the drive is only 256 gigs
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.000]   in this base model, right?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.800]   So I've got it.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.560]   This is the other world computing SSD, USB 3 SSD.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.480]   That's my data drive.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.040]   It's another 256 gigs.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.880]   It's the only way I could use this.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.680]   I think the PCI lanes are set up to prioritize the graphics
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.680]   cards and then Thunderbolt and USB 3
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.000]   are sharing PCI lanes instead of getting dedicated ones.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.560]   Buffalo sends cells this as a Thunderbolt device.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.360]   It's a bus-driven drive.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.080]   5,400 RPM drive, so there's a problem.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.720]   And it's really just USB 3 with a Thunderbolt interface
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.920]   on it, right?
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.560]   Well, and the big thing is, well, what's really the limiter
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.760]   there is not going to be the USB 3.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   It's going to be the drive speed is going to really explode.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.760]   Absolutely.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.260]   Absolutely.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.440]   But even on this very fastest SSD, it's not.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.000]   So and then the second issue is 4K monitors.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.040]   And we talked about this on Twit with Marcus Brownlee,
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.240]   who has a Mac Pro.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.960]   There's a-- you know, if you're going to get a real--
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.360]   so most of the monitors, 4K monitors,
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.560]   are 30 Hertz refresh rate.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.160]   Well, because they didn't know how people are going
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.080]   to connect to it, I think that this is kind of the wild,
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.600]   wild west right now where they're trying to figure out
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.240]   what that format is going to look like.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.800]   And rather than getting together and talking about it,
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.880]   they're all trying to be the one that everyone follows.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.400]   Right.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.800]   So you're going to want to look for one that's faster.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:11.240]   And Marcus bought an Asus Apple selling a Shark.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:16.040]   Both of them, over $3,000 for 30-inch, 31-inch displays.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.160]   I have to admit, I was actually not
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.680]   that sure about 4K.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.880]   And we were streaming for Panasonic,
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.680]   so I was in the Panasonic booth all day
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.680]   and looking back and forth.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.120]   And I'm afraid it happened where you might-- you know
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.880]   how your eye switches.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.160]   And so it was like, HD's fine.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   And 4K is whatever.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:35.840]   And HD's fine.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.440]   4K is whatever.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.800]   And then suddenly, HD was mush.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.840]   You start to see it.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.400]   It was like back, forth, back, forth.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.160]   But I didn't really see it.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.840]   And then suddenly with two of them sitting next to each other
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.120]   all day, and you keep on walking by it,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.280]   and suddenly you looked at it and it's just like a--
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.320]   it looks the way HD did to me when I was comparing it to SD.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.280]   You know, but it took a little longer than SD
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.440]   for me to click like that.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.320]   But now it's just like this nice sharp image.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.760]   And I'm still going to wait, because I think the formats
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.600]   are a little messy.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.920]   And I think that it's still--
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.160]   I think we need the prices to come down a little bit.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.680]   But although Visio now is getting down
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.640]   to a reasonable size for at least a TV set.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.360]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.760]   I think you need better--
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.560]   Go ahead.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.720]   I think we need better OS 10 support as well,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   because some of the Windows drivers are doing a better job.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.000]   My boss ordered the Mac Pro.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.720]   He hasn't got it yet.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   But he got the-- you got three 4K monitors arrived already.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.640]   So he's been trying to hook them up to his MacBook Pro.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.840]   And at first, he could only get one running on Thunderbolt,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.200]   one running on HDMI, both at 30 Hertz.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.680]   Now he's got both of them running off of HDMI,
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.320]   but the HDMI is only giving him 1080.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.640]   And he had to hack because I think he got the Dell's.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.320]   And they're not officially supported yet.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.480]   So he had to hack to make it recognize the Dell's
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.640]   as 4K monitors.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.280]   And he's got it running, but it's still--
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   the pixels are tiny because you can't do the overscan,
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.680]   sort of the scaling modes like you can
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.120]   on the Retinum MacBook Pro displays.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.920]   So we need both a better standard for it
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.920]   and better support from OS 10 before we
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.640]   get the glorious giant screens that we really want.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.200]   So it's just a little caveat that you're
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.680]   going to get this thing, and you're
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.800]   going to find that the support for the ecosystem is not there yet.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.600]   It's just early days.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.400]   Bleeding edge still.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.200]   However--
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.960]   It's beautiful.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.080]   I was looking at his screens this morning,
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.680]   and the stuff is tiny, but it is so gorgeous.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.760]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:23.240]   And on the Mac Pro, the design is exactly right.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.600]   This giant thermal core with a single big fan at the bottom
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.920]   that takes air from the bottom and blows it up to the top.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.880]   Even when working-- you know, it's hard to get this thing
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.160]   to work hard.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.960]   This is a base unit, 3.7 gigahertz Zioni 5 quad core.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.720]   But it's hard to get it to work at all.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   So I ran BioShock Infinite at the highest settings,
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.840]   didn't challenge it, at least.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.400]   But if it were to get hot, the cooling's excellent.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.480]   I can't get it to heat up.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.560]   And it's dead silent.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.160]   You know, it's funny, because when I hooked up the Buffalo
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.760]   drive, all of a sudden, I was like, what's that sound?
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.560]   And I realized, oh, no, the hard drive.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.120]   I'm not hearing the computer at all.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.080]   Zero dB.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.560]   I mean, it is silent.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:11.840]   It's so silent that this was making a ruckus.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.000]   Apparently, the GPUs and the CPU aren't expected to all be
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.240]   on at the same time anyway.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.760]   So the thermal core is more than sufficient at moving,
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.640]   whichever one or maybe a few seconds, two of them are--
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.840]   It's a real design.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.320]   Yeah, so I'm going to have to shoot some 4K video.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.160]   I'm going to borrow--
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.480]   Hey, do we still have that black magic 4K camera?
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.320]   I shouldn't ask.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.360]   Does Russell's call?
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.360]   Russell's reviewing that, I think.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.520]   We have reds downstairs.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.360]   OK.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.560]   Oh, maybe I'll go down to the basement and say hi to red.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.080]   I need--
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.280]   I should look at at least one of them.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.160]   I need like some 4K--
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:45.440]   what is it?
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.320]   2.2.2 video?
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:46.760]   What do I want?
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.200]   Something completely uncompressed?
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.560]   You should raw with the red cameras.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.000]   And then what should I do?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.080]   I should render it as a MPEG-4 or something.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.640]   See how long that takes.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.640]   Real player?
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.200]   Real player.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.040]   That's it.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.480]   Put it in a real format.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:12.000]   Anyway, if you've got $3,000 burning a hole in your pocket,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.880]   I'm glad I got it.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.880]   And thank you, Ed Ingeber, for making that possible.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.200]   And Alex, when you get back, you can play with it.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.960]   I do think that Apple kind of did a great service to everybody
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.560]   by having supplies so constrained early.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:31.720]   Because whatever horniness that you had to immediately buy
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.960]   one-- if they were available in quantity,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.280]   the day that they originally shipped to anybody,
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.480]   then there'd be a lot of people who now are like,
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.600]   now that it's two months later or a month later,
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:45.280]   they're thinking, then again, I'm going to spend $3,000.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.560]   Let's at least wait to see other people
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.280]   if they're really that good.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:51.840]   Because--
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.920]   I don't want to be ready to marry one,
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.440]   but even Massachusetts wouldn't allow that.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:59.360]   Even Massachusetts.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.680]   Even Massachusetts.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.200]   It says the Canadian.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.200]   The Canadian.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.800]   You know, the first date that legalizes marriages
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.080]   between Geeks and Mac Pros, I'm moving.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.440]   I'm trying to find my--
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.880]   what is it, not Cinebench, my Blackmagic Disc benchmark.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:26.000]   Because the internal drive is so fast, you just go, wow.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Wow.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.120]   And then you start trying to figure out what to do with that.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.120]   Yeah, there's nothing I could do with it.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:31.880]   It's crazy.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.200]   Cray-cray.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.680]   It's cray-cray fast.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.640]   Yeah, for the machines that we're going to be using for hangouts,
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.480]   our plan was to just get the very base model.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.920]   But the production machines were probably
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.120]   going to go ahead and put as much of the drive in as we can,
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.280]   just because we know there are times we're going to want to use it.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.520]   So Blackmagic does this so that you can see
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.560]   whether it can ingest your video.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.880]   It's green check marks in every square.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.560]   Right speed of 756 megabytes per second.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.360]   Read speed of very close to a gigabyte a second.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.240]   Just saying.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:10.280]   I mean, it pegged this meter like boom.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.480]   And we always have to put this in perspective.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:21.800]   I think in 1994, we had to reformat our raids every week
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.480]   to make sure that we could maintain 30 megs a second.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.560]   We're on our media 100.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.040]   Right.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.040]   30 megs.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.080]   30 megs a second.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.920]   And that was so we could get uncompressed or--
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.680]   --not even uncompressed, but mostly uncompressed SD.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.240]   And so that we could work.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.800]   And then uncompressed, we had to build raids.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.680]   And to build to uncompressed in 2005,
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.880]   we were building those huge raids for Macbreak.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.680]   And those were-- those just had to tag out at about 220 megs
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.600]   a second.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.440]   And those were like $11,000 each.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.200]   And now it's--
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.040]   Look at this.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.040]   And your computer.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.160]   Let me computer.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.360]   Well, it's because it's a little--
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.360]   --bus PCI--
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.560]   --are completing.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.680]   I mean, Apple's done a lot to make that fast,
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.560]   but boy, it's fast.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.640]   And by the way, one of the things that that's really good
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.720]   for for those of you wondering what you would do
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.960]   with that kind of speed, compression,
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.280]   if you're doing a lot of compression,
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.960]   one of the things that really actually-- you're
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.120]   grabbing a lot of footage and you're actually churning it
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:17.640]   through.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.880]   And the processor usually handles that really quickly.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.160]   And what really oftentimes is the limiter is actually the drive.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.520]   So having a drive with that kind of read/write speed
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.840]   actually will oftentimes speed up if you're
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.320]   trying to compress to H.264 from an uncompressed file
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.200]   or an Apple ProRes file or something like that.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.840]   You may see a lot of increases.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.880]   So something a little bit more mundane than 3D
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.160]   or other big heavy editing tools.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.920]   If you're doing that, that's another good reason
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.920]   to have really, really fast drives.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.760]   Do you think that this will ever be a goodbye for just
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.360]   your average user?
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.640]   Well, it really runs so far very quickly.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.400]   My mom would love this.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.560]   It can almost run fast.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.520]   I can definitely see producers in Hollywood getting it
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.320]   because it looks cool.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.600]   But I think that--
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.360]   I mean, the iMacs are pretty beefy at this point.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:02.840]   It's already mac and--
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.320]   That's what Ed did.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.600]   The reason I have this is because Ed had buyers or more.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.640]   So he said, you know, I don't need this.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.440]   I'm going to get an iMac.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.760]   And he was absolutely right.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.720]   That's the thing to get for 99.9%.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.600]   But for the 1%ers--
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.200]   Oh, those 1%ers.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.080]   And also, it's not like an iMac where they can't really
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.800]   tell which one you have or the old Mac Pro, where they can't
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.120]   really tell which one you have.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.480]   Either you have that latest, greatest, incredibly awesome
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.440]   Xenon-based Mac Pro or you do not.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.160]   And if you do not-- if you're sufficiently weak will,
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:35.960]   that's a problem that you--
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.480]   I'm very weak.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.600]   --that's for $3,000.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.440]   I actually put this in the window of my house with light on.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.160]   Like, you like these Swiss Army knife, like window display.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.160]   You just need to have like--
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.160]   I would say they're really rotating.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   I would just wear it.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:48.840]   Seriously.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.880]   I mean, at this point, just wear it.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.880]   You know, what it comes with, which is interesting,
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.920]   is black apple stickers.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.880]   It's the only ones that ever seen.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.240]   They're black, only they're white, right?
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.640]   So there's that.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   I mean, you can put it on the bumper of your car
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.880]   and everyone knows that you have.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.080]   It's basically saying, follow me home and steal my computer.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.200]   Well, it saves you from having to put it in the backseat window
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.680]   all the time.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.640]   Now you can just put a sticker there and say, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.120]   I feel so guilty owning this.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.920]   I just feel so guilty.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.480]   Maybe that's another third party opportunity.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.480]   If you could manufacture like out of like a good like lightweight
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.200]   plastic, like a rim, like this big circular rim,
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.000]   you can snap onto the bottom of it so you can wear it
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.200]   like an Abe Lincoln hat.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   And you go.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.040]   No one's going to steal it from your office
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   and everyone will know that you only Abe--
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.080]   I don't know if the back pro hat.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.880]   We'll keep your head warm.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.400]   Exactly.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.440]   It'll conduct heat away from the top of your head
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.080]   on hot days.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.080]   That's true.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.760]   That's reducing your summer thermal load.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.760]   That's true.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.280]   And on a cold day, just turn it around.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.680]   It'll blows hot air down in your head.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   No, you just wear it upside down on cold days.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.480]   I guess a dark castle runs great on this, though.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.280]   Like, keep your head.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.640]   And you know, I come from an era--
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.000]   I literally remember a 386 Dell--
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.160]   or no, it was digital equipment.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.680]   386 PC worth $10,000 in my desk.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.440]   This was many years ago, but that was a 386.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.760]   At least it was like that, I think, too.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.080]   So I mean, this is not--
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.040]   This is real money back then, Leo.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.160]   10 grand was a lot of money back then.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.440]   But the differences between-- what
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.120]   was the mid-range computer back then that was still--
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.800]   This was the highest end you could get.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.240]   This was basically considered a workstation at that time.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.360]   So I got to point out one other thing.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.640]   You think for all that money, Apple
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.360]   throw in a mouse and a keyboard?
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.000]   No.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.480]   No.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.360]   Nothing.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.280]   Not a Thunderbolt cable, nothing.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.200]   You got a power cable, Leo, and you're happy to get it.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.720]   Yes.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.640]   A power cable and black stickers.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.120]   Hey, does it have a backup power cable?
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.200]   Or is it a normal power cable?
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.880]   It's black.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.480]   What does it have?
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.520]   Is it two prongs or three prongs?
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.000]   No, no, it's the same one as on the cinematist.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.040]   I'd pull it out, but it would--
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.120]   It's a normal one.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.920]   You could see it here, right?
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.800]   It's a normal one right here.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   It's just like--
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.440]   It's got that nice soft silicone that Apple does for its power.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.240]   You know, they do that really well.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.320]   They do that on the HDMI cables too.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:23.880]   It's pretty.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.240]   They really are.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.360]   I love our HDMI cables.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:26.920]   It's really silly.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.960]   All of our HDMI cables that we use for production
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.880]   are all the Apple ones, because they just--
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.360]   They don't-- they're not as harsh,
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.360]   and they just pop right out, and they're not too thin.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.880]   And it's very weird.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.200]   Might be quiet if someone else doesn't do that.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.800]   It's also something to think about when
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.560]   you see that kind of packaging that is part of the factor
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.040]   when they're budging this out, that how much will it cost us
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.720]   to ship these across the country and across the world?
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.800]   And that's-- the minimalist packaging
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.600]   is all about if they can get one more unit per box,
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.760]   if they can get X more units per container,
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.280]   they know exactly how much money they're saving on that.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.760]   But enjoy the free stickers.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.920]   Where is the bulk of the--
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.320]   In terms of adding to the bulk of that package,
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.360]   it will give you anything that is flat and native of plastic.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.760]   Yeah, the manual and a sticker.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.400]   So-- Where's the black keyboard and mouse, the Leo?
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.480]   You need to color coordinate now.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.000]   That's right.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:17.920]   I mean, come on, Apple.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.400]   I spent $3,300 on this thing.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.720]   Give me a keyboard, a mouse.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.240]   I'm on the added eyes, black phone.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.720]   That is consistently-- the only thing
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.440]   I don't like about the Apple stores,
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.400]   because they are 10 out of 10 in every single category.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.400]   I just remember when I spent $1,500 on Google Glass,
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.120]   I was like one of them high society
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.280]   games getting a $5,000 like nail treatment.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.920]   I went to-- it was like a salon.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.720]   They asked me if I wanted a beverage.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.680]   They sat me down.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.120]   They set it up for me.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.840]   They stayed with me for an hour.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.440]   The two times I bought Mac books in the Mac store,
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.480]   it's like, oh, you're going to pick up that thing you dropped $2,000 on?
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.400]   OK, here.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:53.800]   Bye.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.200]   I agree.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.760]   They're way too casual.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.600]   I want applause.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.640]   I want a line up of blue-shirted employees going, well done.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.920]   You've just spent thousands of dollars on hardware from Apple.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.240]   If you feel a little neck massage.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.040]   The--
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.920]   At least use your bathroom.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:13.600]   No.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.080]   No.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:14.440]   No.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.720]   Deploys only.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.720]   You got a blue t-shirt?
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.800]   I do have to say that I was completely wrong.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.600]   I really thought that this would be a mega bundle.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.480]   It would have been a very cheap way for Apple
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.880]   to make this more palatable as by bundling all the pro apps on it
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.920]   or something.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.240]   They don't even give you a goddamn keyboard.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.760]   Nope.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.200]   So I was wrong.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.720]   But what kind of keyboard could they
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.120]   bundle with it that would satisfy all that big swath of people
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.160]   who are buying the Mac Pro?
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.320]   Just make it black.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.520]   I mean, I think we could come up with a long list of things
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.440]   that I'm officially over.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.760]   Like, I'm over the idea that Apple doesn't include USB
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.040]   accessories with these devices.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.920]   Because, all right, I mean, it would be nice to get these things.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.960]   But truth be told, over on my desk over there,
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.400]   there is a beautiful Logitech keyboard I've been using
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.120]   for three and a half years.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:02.880]   Because it's my favorite.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.480]   That will not displace whatever is cheap and light and thin enough
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.880]   to include in a package.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.240]   It's emoll-frit.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.720]   I just got to say, you buy an iMac,
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.960]   you get a keyboard and a mouse.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.280]   And one of the things that I-- but I think one of the things
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.840]   with this also is I think that the design team went all out.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.240]   Because I personally think this is probably
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:27.040]   the last form factor of the Mac Pro ever.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.640]   I think that this is--
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.120]   This is perfect.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.520]   You should not change this.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.560]   But no, but what I'm saying is I don't mean that it's going
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.280]   to-- I just think that this is the last time they're
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.280]   going to do this.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.800]   And when we look at how long it took to get from the cheese
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.720]   grater to this--
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.520]   Well, no, come on.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.840]   Five years from now, they're going to have a new Mac Pro.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.360]   Come on.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:43.880]   Right?
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.720]   20 years?
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.240]   20 years?
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.120]   20, no, five.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:47.880]   Three.
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.120]   I don't think that'll make it.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.840]   Alex, I'll make it half the size.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.120]   I'll tell you, when you compare this to the cheese grater Mac
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.720]   Pro, now admittedly, that had six drive face.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.160]   But this is so fast.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.640]   This is so much power in this little bitty thing.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.240]   It's pretty cool for that reason alone.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.520]   No, I think it's awesome.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.360]   And I'm just saying--
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.000]   Are you saying there will be no more Mac Pros,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.120]   or they're just going to continue to make Mac Pros that
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.680]   look like this?
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.840]   They'll continue to make Mac Pros look like this until there
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.120]   will be no Mac Pros.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.120]   I mean, it's not going to be a Mac Pro.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.400]   When will there be no Mac Pros?
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.160]   Some day.
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:17.840]   10 years.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.840]   10 years from now.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.920]   What will you get instead?
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.320]   Your whatever your touchscreen, weird thing that they have out
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.160]   will be fast enough.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.360]   And you won't-- it's just not going to be their market.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.000]   I just don't think that they're moving away from this.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.640]   I think that this is a great way to close that off.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.600]   And build something that we're all going to be happy with
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.920]   for at least four or five years.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.160]   And then we'll wonder where--
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.080]   I could see them doing one that is the size and shape
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.360]   of a Rubik's cube.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:50.920]   I just can't help but think that this were soon.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.840]   In a couple of weeks, there'll be the 30th anniversary
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.160]   of the original Macintosh.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.040]   And though the shape has changed, the form has changed.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:02.840]   We still have keyboard here, pointing device here, screen here.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.960]   So that hasn't changed.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:10.520]   And that basic design has gone for at least 10 years before that.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.840]   So I don't know.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.560]   I don't want to say too much.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.720]   I think it will change.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.560]   I just don't think-- I think this is--
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.040]   I think we should just enjoy the moment and enjoy the fact
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.120]   that we have this crazy, fast computer and the fact
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.880]   that Apple-- this is not Apple's market anymore.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.600]   And I think that they're going to give us this last little push
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:25.880]   out.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.080]   And a lot of us are going to keep on using it and loving it.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.720]   But I don't think that we're going to--
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.960]   I don't want to bring everybody down.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.960]   I was looking at it.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.040]   I don't know if it's going to be that blatant.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.520]   I think that in five years' time,
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.320]   it's possible that Apple has so--
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.720]   they do what they want.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.000]   And what they want to do is something
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.840]   that they do extremely well.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.480]   And I think that in five years, for now, there's no more Mac
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:48.760]   Pro.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.200]   It's because they have figured out how
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.280]   to make beautiful computers for the majority
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:00.320]   of the population that works for them even better than a computer
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.320]   that costs half as much.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.560]   They can possibly afford.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.600]   But maybe they'll start to let go of a lot of the Pro users
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.440]   and a lot of the Pro users in frustration
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.600]   will leave for other platforms.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.360]   I find it harder.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.160]   The funny thing, they decided that wasn't a market that
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.280]   was big enough to do it for trouble.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.200]   Also, the servers are--
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   a server is not something that Apple was ever really,
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.120]   really, really good at.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.640]   The Mac Mini has been in every single server room I've seen,
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   but that's sort of a freak case, I think,
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.280]   in terms of what administrators really want to see from servers,
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.400]   Apple is just not interested or willing to make that.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.600]   But Apple has done really, really well-making
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:36.760]   pro-level computers.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:44.320]   In terms of giving a tool that is manifestly
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.080]   the weapon of a warrior for creative people who
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.440]   are fighting the creative temper-- oh, fondant, fondant, fondant.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.840]   Oh, corner radius.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.320]   Oh, index of refraction of the paint glass.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.320]   That's a big circle.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.320]   I think I'll do him, sir.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.160]   I'm just going to say, this is the last Mac Pro I'll ever own.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.480]   I don't know if you look like you're fondling Mr. Bigel's
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.000]   worth.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.840]   I'll never leave you.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.320]   Right, for the record, there are five different went-a-systems
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:13.480]   that I've thought of that said, no, we better not say that.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.680]   I like doing this show, and I like twin existing.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.640]   And if I said one of those things,
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.240]   can one of both of those things which
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.240]   seems to be true anymore?
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.880]   I think that what really-- and by the way, please,
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.800]   don't send me email saying, you could buy a keyboard
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.440]   and mouse for $15.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.000]   I know.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.360]   I have plenty of keyboards and mice.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.600]   I'm just joking.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:36.280]   I do have to say-- and a final word on this.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.760]   For whatever-- it's way overpriced.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.400]   Nobody needs a power, blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.600]   This is a computer you literally can fall in love with.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.960]   I'm just saying.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.800]   Apple does that so well.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.920]   I'm kind of--
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.160]   It's like owning a Lamborghini.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.520]   I'm kind of fond of it.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.320]   I don't know.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.040]   I think I would be more--
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.800]   I think I would get more day to day enjoyment from a Mac
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.640]   row than a Lamborghini, in my opinion.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   I don't know how I'd probably be.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.080]   I sit down every night.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.280]   I sit down and go, what am I going to do with you?
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.160]   And I open the browser and I go to Facebook.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:06.960]   It's depressing.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.200]   But I'm not likely to send a Mac row into a ditch
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.280]   by the side of a road.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.400]   That's one thing to do.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.280]   Leo, how good is it at home theater PC?
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.680]   I'm not using it as--
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.160]   believe it or not, the Xbox One is a perfect home theater
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.040]   PC.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.080]   And I'm using that as my home theater PC.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:22.920]   And that's fine.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.760]   It's too inexpensive.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.280]   You need a much more expensive home.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:30.720]   The real truth is I have absolutely zero need for this.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.000]   But I do love it.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.440]   I really-- it's something about it.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.000]   You just kind of fall in love with it.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.480]   I don't-- it's hard to describe.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.440]   That's always been one of Apple's strengths.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.320]   And it's not a trivial thing either.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.000]   You're saying it's OK, Andy?
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:44.520]   No, I'm just--
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.080]   I love it.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.360]   I'm saying do not--
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.680]   there are objects in that very room you're sitting in right
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.560]   now that are capable of returning your love in a significant way
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.960]   that will pay off for you the phone run.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.720]   As opposed to--
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:03.440]   as opposed to forcing you to go find a box of wet naps
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.920]   and get that stuff off your Mac Pro.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.480]   I'm just--
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:13.200]   I'm just saying that there are so many laptops out there
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.840]   that I think are really, really great.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.560]   I really like my new MacBook.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.200]   But I also like these $250 Chromebooks.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.160]   And whatever the advantages of a Chromebook
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.800]   are, when you take it out of the box,
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.960]   you don't feel like, oh, man, that
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.800]   is manifestly the weapon of a king.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.000]   This is a beautiful thing that--
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:31.640]   I feel like--
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.000]   I feel like--
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.760]   I feel like the fondle cam.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.120]   We-- you know, we've got to do it at 1 AM.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.520]   Coming up at 1.10.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.000]   There-- you know, look, the reason we get into this business
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.960]   for a lot of us-- certainly it was for me--
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.080]   is a love of technology, a love of--
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.160]   Apple's taught us a love of design.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.400]   Fair not speak its name.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:56.160]   And every once in a while, an object comes out.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:00.000]   That's a really fetishistically beautiful.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.640]   And they're rare.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.800]   And when they come out, you want to kind of celebrate
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.320]   the best honor.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.200]   I mean, this is--
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.360]   There's a reason why so many of the people on this show
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.920]   and listening to the show have a G-format cube.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.960]   Exactly.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.800]   I had that--
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.040]   That is not in storage, not been given away.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.040]   It's just a beautiful object that gives them
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.480]   pleasure to simply have it on the shelf somewhere.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.480]   That's not an easy thing for tech company to--
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.840]   OK, now you're freak--
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.320]   You're giving me out a little bit of--
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.920]   I shall call her her.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.240]   If next week we finally put a set of wax lips
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.360]   on the side of that, I might have to sit out a couple of shows.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.800]   But you know, it's just going to be
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.680]   flaunting that forever and staying young.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.080]   It could be my pillow wife.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.760]   All right, enough of this sillyness.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.640]   It is, you mentioned--
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.600]   You know what we ought to do?
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.680]   I do have to admit, because it was a show all over it.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.800]   We should go back and look at when they first announced it
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.880]   and then have all of these-- all of our comments.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.800]   I completely-- I freely--
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.800]   I mocked it.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.400]   Well, I don't want to do this at all.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.520]   I thought it was stupid.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.040]   I said, who's going to want to buy this?
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.400]   It starts at 3,000.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.480]   But by the time you equip it properly,
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.280]   you're talking 10 grand.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.360]   All of that's still true.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:05.800]   In fact--
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:06.760]   And then you saw it.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.920]   And then I saw it.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.200]   It is.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:09.720]   It's like--
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.640]   --the harp music.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.960]   --lights on the gop.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.960]   It's like if you knew that falling in love with Scarlett
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.600]   Johansson would cost you a lot of money
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.040]   and a lot of heartbreak and it eventually--
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.400]   George Clooney would come along and steal her away.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   But you still--
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.560]   That's everything.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.960]   Mac Pro, you're completing.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:34.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.840]   It is the 30th anniversary.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:40.680]   Hey, look, I remember going to Macy's in March 1984,
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:46.440]   plunking down my Macy's card, spending $2,500 for a Mac.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.840]   The original Macintosh that did nothing, basically.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.160]   You had to swap disks 100 times to copy a file.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:58.840]   And I loved that too, just as much.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:03.240]   30 years ago-- and in fact, January 25th, there is an event
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.280]   you should all come to in the Cupertino at the Flint Center
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.320]   where the Macintosh was originally announced
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:13.280]   on January 25th, 30 years ago, 1984.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.240]   Mark Cantor sent me a little video inviting you and me
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.360]   and everybody else.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.440]   Before there was Google, Facebook, Twitter,
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.440]   there was the Macintosh.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.160]   And I don't know where this panel discussion was,
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.120]   but Steve Jobs--
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.200]   And I'd like them to just take 30 seconds
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.120]   and introduce themselves and maybe talk a little bit about
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.720]   the piece that they did starting with my right--
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.960]   Introducing the Mac team.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.320]   I guess this is a plunking.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.360]   And I worked a little bit on the ROM,
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.800]   and I helped Bruce Horan with the Finder.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.280]   My name's Andy Hertzfeld, and I worked in a lot of the system
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.920]   software for Macintosh.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.200]   My name's Randy Wiginton, and I wrote the work processor.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.400]   My name's Bill Atkinson.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.600]   I did the Quick Draw Graphics Primitives
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.160]   and the MacPaid application.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.960]   I'm Bruce Horan, and I worked on the ROM little
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.040]   and on the Finder with Steve Capps.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.640]   My name is Burl Smith, and I designed the Digital Logic
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.040]   Board for Macintosh.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.120]   Hi, I'm someone from Dans Horan.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.000]   I did the planning.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.200]   My name's Ronnie Seabach, and I wrote the mouse lesson
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.040]   that you get on your Mac guy disc and the fuck.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.320]   That is going to be an event.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.160]   I'm looking forward to going to that,
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.680]   celebrating the 30th anniversary of the announcement
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.960]   of the Macintosh at Flint Center, same place.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.760]   And I expect many of those people, obviously, if you won't,
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.080]   but many of those people will be there.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.200]   And I'm sure Waz will be there.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.520]   I know I've heard from a lot of people.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.640]   They should let us stream it.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.240]   Mark, let us stream it.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.200]   That's a great idea.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.600]   Or at least stream it the next day.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   That's a great idea.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.240]   Let me send him an email.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.840]   That's a very good idea, because that's
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.200]   the kind of thing I know our audience
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:46.000]   would be very, very interested in.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.720]   Let's take a break.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:53.000]   I'm getting a little emotional here.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.360]   Mouse from Mr. LaPorte.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.640]   Mouse from Mr. LaPorte.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.080]   He won't do a macro out of his eye line.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.040]   It's so beautiful.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.320]   I have nothing-- there's nothing I can do with it.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.520]   Well, I have an eye movie I'd like to work on,
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.840]   and then I'm going to eel me out some people, maybe go
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.320]   do some Soudoku puzzles.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.720]   I'm very happy for you.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.320]   We joke, but we're all very happy for you.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:16.920]   Can it launch?
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.840]   Quick look, an acceptable speed.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.880]   What's-- oh, you mean when you press spacebar?
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.600]   Yeah, no.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.800]   Yeah, it does.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.320]   There's no hesitation in anything it does.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.000]   It does it with confidence and assurance.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.720]   So when you do a spotlight search,
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.080]   you'll actually search on the search term you type,
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.480]   not on the letters 4 through 19.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   That's right.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.720]   Even with Mavericks.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.400]   That's worth 3 grand right there.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.600]   It'll give you the result before you search.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.760]   Oh, god.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.880]   Fondok, nice.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:51.880]   My darling, I'm getting up for your love, baby.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.200]   I don't know.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.200]   I don't know.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.880]   I don't know.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.880]   You could be.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:06.880]   You are so sorry.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:13.920]   I am here in your heart and my heart will go on.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.880]   It's so wrong.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.400]   I need Bruno Mars, some flowers, a little champagne.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.600]   So Vegas, baby.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.400]   Some candlelight.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.160]   Are you sure?
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.200]   You guys want to be alone, Leo?
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.040]   I do.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:29.400]   I really-- I want to just leave right now with my Mac Pro.
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:36.120]   Design is very important to those of us
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.600]   who live in the Apple world.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.440]   Anybody who follows Apple at any length of time
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.640]   understands that, I think, right?
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.880]   And of course, as Steve Jobs always said,
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.200]   it's the intersection of technology and science
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.040]   and liberal arts.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.520]   And if you are a great scientist, a great programmer,
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.200]   maybe you're a great cook.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.640]   But you need great designs.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.640]   I want to tell you about 99 designs.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:03.600]   99 designs brings you with the world's largest graphic design
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.960]   marketplace to over a quarter of a million graphic designers
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.360]   who are waiting to help you make your stuff look better.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.840]   Perhaps you're interested in a landing page design.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.880]   That's really-- the first thing people
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.000]   see of your business often on the web--
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:18.800]   99 designs.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.640]   You tell them what you need.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.000]   Dozens of designers from the community will say,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.560]   I got an idea what about this.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.640]   You give them some feedback.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.520]   You refine the design.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.320]   You select the designer you want.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.160]   You pay for your favorite.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.920]   Do you need fresh marketing collateral?
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.720]   99 designs offers all kinds of marketing design.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.560]   You can get a sleek, affordable email template, a banner ad,
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.600]   an infographic.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.400]   Even you could do a vehicle wrap design.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.040]   We do T-shirts.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.440]   App designers use 99 designs.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.560]   Landing pages started just $2.99.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.920]   You could start your next graphic design project at 99designs.com
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.920]   for as little as $199.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.920]   And I invite you to go to 99designs.com/mbw

[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.800]   your design project in their marketplace.

[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.520]   Leo will report with Andy Inatko with Renee Ritchie,
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.280]   with Alex Lindsey.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.280]   OK.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.400]   Let's go from the sublime to the ridiculous.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.800]   If you were watching the NFL playoffs,
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.960]   do you get to see football at all in the Kilgolly?
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.240]   No, probably not.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.040]   No, the problem is both weekends, I've been flying.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.080]   So I just see it as I go through the airport.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.760]   So I think I was in Istanbul or something
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.800]   at the lounge when--
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.400]   Well, let me play this for you because you would have seen this
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.200]   on the NFL playoffs.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.480]   And I wonder, this is the new iPad ad.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.560]   And I really wonder what the reaction of people
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.080]   is, particularly the narration.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:19.440]   Listen.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.520]   Don't read and write poetry because it's cute.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.960]   We read and write poetry because we
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.960]   are members of the human race and the human race is filled with passion.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:35.160]   Medicine, law, business, engineering,
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.960]   these are noble pursuits necessary to sustain life.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:47.240]   But poetry, beauty, romance, love,
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.880]   these are what we stay alive for.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:59.320]   The Copan Whitman owe me a life of the questions
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:03.600]   of these recurring, of the endless strains
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.600]   of the faithless, of cities filled with the foolish.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.440]   How much?
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.760]   What good amid these owe me a life?
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.000]   Answer that you are here, that life--
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   Does it work with USB?
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.640]   Identity.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:24.920]   That the powerful play goes on, and you contribute over us.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.520]   Does it come with the case or do I have to buy that expert?
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.520]   A powerful play.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.280]   Sit down with a giant windmill.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:30.800]   You.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.760]   And who's this guy?
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.400]   And why is he looking at me like that?
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.320]   What will your verse be?
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.040]   I got to say, it makes me want to go out and rent
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:39.960]   dead poets society.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.480]   And I bent the Reynolds for dead poets society.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480]   It's through the roof.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.560]   I was going to say, I wondered if--
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.680]   who did the voiceover for that?
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.240]   It's Robin Williams literally from the dead poets.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.600]   That's why the audio is so crappy.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.800]   You can barely hear what he's saying.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.280]   OK.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.920]   I've not seen dead poets society.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.920]   Oh!
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.440]   Andy, great movie.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.320]   It's Wicked Good.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320]   What?
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.880]   I was in my non-Robin Williams drama phase.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.240]   I've been burned too often.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.680]   That's kind of a permanent phase.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.200]   I'm a Hudson-Lepse scars.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.960]   That's kind of a permanent phase.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.440]   This was a good one.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.360]   This was a good one.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.880]   But I just-- so a couple of things come to mind.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.840]   A number of people said that sounds much like the voice
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:21.080]   in the 1984 commercial.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.120]   The Big Brother voice.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.600]   OK, that's weird.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.840]   It also feels like it's somebody at Apple trying to do
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.360]   here's to the crazy ones, but failing.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.960]   And couldn't they just have brought Robin
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.360]   in to recreate that in a sound booth with it sounds good?
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:37.720]   I just--
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.160]   Nothing said no.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.480]   It's just puzzling.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.200]   Is that a successful ad?
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.000]   It's a very pretty object.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.120]   I'll put it that way.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.360]   But again--
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.960]   Oh, I think the images are brilliant.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.520]   I love the images.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.800]   Unfortunately, that's all I'm left saying.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.600]   I don't know whether it's a good hat or a bad hat,
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.400]   because only someone inside Apple apparently
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.080]   will knows what that wasn't meant to achieve.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.560]   But I mean, I was joking around during the voiceover.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.320]   But I think that most people, when
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.760]   they're looking at a commercial like that,
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.200]   they're thinking, what is being advertised here?
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.160]   How much does it cost?
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.720]   What can it do for me?
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.200]   And there's aspirational advertising.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.000]   And a lot of advertising not only gives you
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.440]   the practical stuff, but also just gets you in the mood
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.520]   where you start feeling--
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.240]   your imagination runs wild about the product.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.800]   But I think that this sort of tips over to the other side
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.760]   where, again, what are you advertising for me?
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.320]   I rarely scuba with a tablet computer,
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.320]   so perhaps that's not the computer for me.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.840]   Well, if you go to the--
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.080]   If you actually go to the website,
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.000]   they actually are breaking down a lot of the ad.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.200]   So the ad actually is--
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.560]   they're showing a lot of the pieces from the ads
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.800]   and how the iPad's being used in those areas.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.640]   Taking exploration.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.720]   There's new depth, so that's the ocean.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   I think elevating the expedition world class not in the years.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.000]   A commercial that you understand after you go to a website,
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.320]   that's always the gold standard.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.840]   Well, I mean, but I think that a lot of this is--
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.840]   I think that part of this is really pushing the iPad
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.960]   as a creation device rather than a consumption device.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.600]   Because you look at how that juxtaposes it
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.920]   against the Kindle, which is purely a consumption device.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   Yeah, these are all--
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.360]   This is all creative enterprise.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.440]   This is not somebody playing video games.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   You're absolutely--
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.600]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.080]   And the question--
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.040]   It's obviously the beginning of a campaign
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.840]   that will answer the question, what will your versus be?
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.120]   And it's also not productivity.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:30.880]   It's creation.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.560]   And one of the problems Apple's had recently
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.480]   is they didn't show off the iPad on stage
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.160]   since I think Steve Jobs in 2011 with the iPad 2
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.000]   and they did that awesome technology alone is not enough.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.600]   The We Believe commercial.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.480]   And then they let the story of the iPad die.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.400]   They talked about retina displays.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.440]   And they talked about speeds and feeds,
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.640]   which is usually something they don't do.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.000]   And only recently with the iPad Life commercial
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.360]   did they get back to start telling the story of iPad again.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.960]   And this might not be a great--
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.520]   it might not be 100% successful.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.600]   I found it really heavy.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.680]   Both Williams narrative and the music that was accompanying it
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.200]   was very--
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:05.640]   Yeah, very grim.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.920]   --strong and overbearing almost.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.800]   And I think it wasn't as good as it could have been,
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.000]   but I am delighted that Apple is once again talking about what
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.120]   you can do with an iPad and not just the technology
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.240]   they're putting into it.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.640]   It definitely continues a message
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.760]   that they started off with the introduction of the air.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.000]   Remember we were talking about that after the launch event
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.040]   about how this is one of the first times in a while,
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.400]   which the promo video was not, again,
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.720]   kids playing virtual piano and kids
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.400]   and people playing games and people entertaining themselves.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.960]   It was part of that first push saying that the iPad is now--
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.920]   the iPad is now officially a computer in the eyes of Apple.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.360]   It's not something that we don't know exactly what it is,
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.040]   but we're happy to let you guys figure out what that is.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.600]   It really is now--
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.960]   it does occupy the good slot and the good, better, best slot
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.040]   of mobile computers.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:00.120]   But it's just that the only thing that I worry
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.280]   is too strong a word.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.560]   But the only thing that's on my mind
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.680]   is that while people are looking at that computer,
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.240]   the next commercial-- excuse me, at that ad--
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.280]   the next commercial break, there is one of the most
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.240]   to the point and in your face Kindle Fire commercials
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.680]   that says here is what the iPad Air does.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.720]   Here is what the Kindle Fire does.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.880]   Here's how much this costs.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.080]   Here's how much that costs.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.520]   You figure out for yourself whether or not
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.920]   this amount of money is certainly worth it.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.200]   But I think that's the whole thing, though.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.600]   But I think that's exactly the point,
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.040]   because what Apple's saying is, yeah,
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.120]   if you compare those things together,
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:37.960]   maybe our product doesn't look like the Kindle Fire.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.200]   But if you think about it as a creation device,
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.920]   let's have the Kindle Fire try to go do that with it
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.560]   with it overhead.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.000]   But I think that might be some of the push there.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:47.760]   The BMW--
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.760]   That's absolutely--
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.400]   That's absolutely commercial.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.520]   That's absolutely true.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.160]   I'm just saying that I don't know if that--
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.840]   if the ad that Apple put together
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.360]   is making that point effectively.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.840]   I personally think--
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.480]   I guess the way I could describe it
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.680]   is that, to me, it feels like a screensaver commercial,
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.080]   where it's just playing and it's better than a blank screen
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.560]   and it holds your attention in that way.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.440]   But it doesn't guide your thinking in any way.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.360]   And it doesn't leave you with a message.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.440]   All it leaves me is with the awareness
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.600]   that there are things called iPads out there.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.680]   And people do things with them.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.560]   And it is too very different.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.480]   Here's the Kindle Fire ad, by the way.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:26.960]   It's two very different advertising styles.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.160]   This is utilitarian.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.280]   This is like, here's what it does.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.760]   And here's what it costs.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.040]   And then these Apple ad, which is very much an aspirational ad,
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.640]   like the message I guess of the Apple ad is,
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.320]   if you use an iPad, you can aspire to great things.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.120]   What will your great thing be?
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.200]   I like that idea.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.960]   This is much more-- this Kindle ad's very--
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.720]   it's about price.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.760]   It's about--
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.160]   The new Kindle Fire HDX sharp--
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:51.920]   I would--
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.920]   And I would expect this, by the way, from Amazon,
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:57.880]   which is a much more utilitarian company than Apple is.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:02.280]   And I think that as the beginning of a campaign of really
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.000]   talking-- I'm expecting after this what we're going to see a lot
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.040]   of in iPad.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.920]   Because I still think that we're in this very long curve
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.000]   where Apple's moving us away from--
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:13.320]   I agree.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.640]   --I know we've said it's for OS 10 to iOS.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.360]   And now we're going to basically-- we're going to spend
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.760]   the next two years explaining to you
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.200]   why you don't need your laptop.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.600]   And so developing it as a creation device.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.400]   And I think the other possible reason for this
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.240]   is that an ad exec was sitting around with an Apple--
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.920]   his Apple client and said, let's make a Terence Malek
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.320]   commercial.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:36.760]   It was.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:37.920]   That's exactly what it was.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.840]   It was Terence Malek.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.760]   I love Terence Malek.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.520]   And he goes, we can make a whole commercial that way.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.360]   It's a tree of life.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.440]   It's all equally puzzling to me.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.440]   But can you imagine--
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.680]   Just with the later music.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.360]   Do you think we could hire Terence Malek to do this?
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.000]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.560]   We'll just watch a lot of Terence Malek films.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.080]   And then we'll make it just like it.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.680]   I think Sarah Lane said that, Renee,
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.080]   that it made her feel creepy.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.200]   It was very kind of creepy.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:02.280]   And the Buddha dancer looking at you is scant.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.000]   It's like, why?
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:03.840]   What are you doing?
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.280]   What?
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.040]   Me?
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.160]   I mean, it didn't make you feel good.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:07.880]   It didn't make me feel good.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.160]   It's a very important lesson in how certain visuals
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.360]   and certain sounds can come together to create a mood.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.360]   That's just a little bit off of what you want.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.760]   Like a little bit lighter music.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.480]   If they change some of the shots differently,
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.440]   then you have that everyday photo commercial.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:19.800]   Right.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.520]   Everybody loved.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.280]   But you put-- the music is too hard.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.920]   The narrative is too serious.
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.960]   And the people keep staring at you like that.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.880]   And suddenly, it takes what could have been a fantastic
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.120]   commercial and makes it a good direction, not perfect delivery.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.080]   Well, you've seen the--
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.160]   I think the main problem with it is that you're showing me
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.160]   all these great visuals, but they're not showing me
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.040]   a single thing that I, myself, could see myself ever doing.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.360]   If you put it in a classroom, if you put it into a coffee shop,
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.760]   if you put it into a living room, and you show me
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.880]   that this can be done for a lot more things
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.000]   than I imagine it can be done, I can imagine myself wanting
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.240]   to do those things.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.560]   But again, I've been scuba diving once, loved it,
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.440]   would love to do it again.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.680]   I'm not sure if I would ever take an iPad down there with me.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.680]   No.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.520]   Yeah, Peter said I made him feel bad about himself.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.280]   He's wasting his life.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.880]   Well, he's a bad person, and he sure would feel bad.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.040]   If you watch Tech News today this morning,
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.960]   Horace Dediu, who I always admire and read
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.840]   with great interest, even though I don't maybe understand
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.080]   everything he says.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:25.200]   Avesimco joined Mike and Sarah talking about his blog post
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.360]   of yesterday when Apple reached parity with Windows.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.080]   He made, I thought, a really interesting point.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.800]   He said, 10 years ago, the way computer purchases worked
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:40.080]   was the biggest buyers were big companies, IT directors who
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.400]   bought thousands of PCs running Windows for the company.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.120]   The employees then went home and bought Windows computers
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.720]   at home because that's what the IT guy says you should have.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.920]   And it drove sales.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:57.000]   And it was why Windows became absolutely dominant in the '90s
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.200]   and to some degree, the 2000s.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.080]   He said the big change was when people
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.720]   started bringing in their own device.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.800]   And suddenly, it cracked the Windows monopoly
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.320]   because people saw other devices.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.320]   They tried other devices.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.280]   He said, what really happens now is there's
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.080]   a much broader diversity.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.040]   Yes, there are still more Windows PCs by far.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:26.840]   337 Windows PCs sold in 2012 compared to perhaps 17 million
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.760]   Macintoshs.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.080]   It's a big difference.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.040]   But because of the broad diversity of the market,
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.840]   in effect, he says Apple has reached parity with Windows.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.560]   It's no longer a Windows world.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.040]   And I thought that was very interesting.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.880]   And a lot of that is because of these devices,
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.560]   because of iPhones and iPads.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.600]   That's what cracked the Windows monopoly.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.480]   And in fact, Microsoft's struggling with Windows 8.1.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.240]   It is a bomb.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.760]   And if you look at Apple taking the iPad
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.520]   and really turning it into your next laptop,
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.600]   iPads have already pooled all this following with them
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.920]   and really undercut that market.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.560]   And if they really move it into something
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.480]   that people really feel like I still--
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.280]   I have a couple iPads and I still feel
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.280]   like I have to do real work on my laptop.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.200]   I'm not sold on that yet.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.480]   But I think that if they can move that to a large population,
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.520]   I think that that continues to drive that market down.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.200]   I was working enterprise.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.280]   And I remember it was PCs as far as the eye could see.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.680]   PC on every desk, PC servers in the server room.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:30.320]   Everyone had Windows, mobile phones, some blackberries.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.760]   And then the CEO got an iPhone because he thought it was cool.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.200]   And then the VP of research and development got an iPhone.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.160]   And then the head of tech support got an iPhone.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.960]   And suddenly we had to support iPhones.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.080]   And then I got a laptop because I was a design guy.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.720]   And design guys can have a MacBook.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.920]   And then the head of development got a MacBook
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.320]   because you wanted the battery life.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.080]   You got a MacBook Air.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.600]   And then another guy got it.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.080]   And all of a sudden the Apple stuff started moving from the top
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.760]   down instead of from IT up.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.240]   And they were just forced to support it.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:56.760]   Exactly.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.160]   And continue to move from there.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.840]   It was a total reversal of a week- previous model.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.840]   We all saw it happen.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.000]   In fact, here's an article this week in the Wall Street
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:03.280]   Journal.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.560]   Apple devices flow into the corporate world.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.520]   The popularity of iPhone and iPad among employees
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.720]   is prompting corporate tech managers to rewrite policies
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.000]   and change traditional buying patterns.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.920]   And by the way, another big loser, Blackberry.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.760]   Apple has, according to the journal, 8%
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.320]   of global business and government spending on computers
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.040]   in 2012.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.360]   That's up from 1% in 2009.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.080]   For us--
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:29.640]   Also I was leaving.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:32.520]   They were replacing all the VGA projectors with Apple TVs.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.360]   Exactly.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.080]   People start with the iPhone.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.960]   It's the tip of the spear that says,
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.680]   chip, Pearson, chief executive, JFJ, MF software.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.720]   And then they realize that iTunes on Windows thinks.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.720]   I get it as computer.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.640]   Well played, Apple.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.200]   Well played.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.720]   I do think that interoperability is as big a factor
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.840]   at least as whatever Apple has done.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:59.440]   Because back when although that original model was certainly
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.520]   relevant, that was a time when you couldn't even
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.320]   have a Windows machine and a different kind of machine
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.600]   on the same network and expect those two things
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.240]   to work together.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:07.760]   Right.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.440]   Apple did a very good job of that.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.400]   Well, they really focused on that.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.280]   Well, the internet to help them.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.920]   Yeah, I'm saying that the new technologies of networking
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.760]   and really the world in general made it less painful
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.360]   to pick whatever device you personally like.
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.840]   I mean, another interesting statistic over the last quarter
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.480]   is that if you compare the amount of absorption
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.680]   of Google Chromebooks in enterprise versus Windows Notebooks,
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:40.080]   Chromebooks are just kicking butt.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.840]   And if you incorrectly look at the numbers,
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.720]   you might even think that they were actually outselling
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.480]   Windows.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.320]   But the amount they rate which Chromebooks are being taken up
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.440]   by enterprise right now, simply by virtue of the fact
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.000]   that it doesn't now doesn't even--
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.080]   it's not even necessary to have a compatible operating
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:59.000]   system that runs what you might call real apps anymore.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.240]   So long as you have a network capable computer
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.280]   that can connect to a central server where the real apps are
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.520]   being hosted, as long as you can connect to where the data is
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.520]   being hosted, everything else is kind of irrelevant.
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:10.840]   And a lot of companies are finding
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:13.520]   that we don't actually even need a MacBook Air.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.320]   We can just simply issue these affordable devices that
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.840]   can easily be left in a cab without causing
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.160]   a whole bunch of damage to a lot of people.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.000]   That's how big this interoperability has become.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:23.520]   You're right.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.200]   And that means it's easier to bring a Chromebook into work
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.400]   or a Mac into work or an iPad into work.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.520]   And once it becomes easier to do that,
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.360]   a huge diverse ecosystem blooms.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.320]   And that's what our--
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.680]   Or us is saying.
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.240]   But it does show what trouble Microsoft is in,
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.680]   because their business has always been about selling Microsoft
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.000]   Windows licenses.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.280]   And now that it's no longer-- it's still immensely popular,
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.920]   but it's not driving a lot of new purchases
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.840]   of Windows licenses, either through upgrades
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.720]   or through purchases of new hardware.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.880]   Now that the iPad is eating into that,
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.640]   now that other manufacturers are eating into that,
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:02.680]   Microsoft is big enough that they can figure things out.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.960]   But man, if they were in a weaker position,
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:07.760]   this would be one of those points where you were wondering
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.320]   how much longer can Microsoft keep this up.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.640]   Somebody in the chat room says, you're
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.000]   kidding, Chromebooks in business?
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.940]   That's exactly the shocking headline from NPD,
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:20.360]   that Chromebooks were enjoying 21% of business--
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.720]   now this is business notebook sales, not home sales.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:27.240]   Business notebook sales in 2013, 21%.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:29.720]   That is a lot of Chromebooks in business.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.200]   I don't know who's using them.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.200]   And I feel sorry for them.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.000]   Well, if it gets back to the idea of IT departments approving
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.520]   hardware, a lot of departments will love a Chromebook
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.840]   because the damn thing is damn near indestructible.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.000]   They configure themselves, they run themselves.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.360]   And once again, if someone leaves something behind in a cab,
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.440]   that's a significantly less significant problem than if someone
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:54.800]   leaves a Windows 8 or Windows 7 notebook in a cab.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.960]   From the Wall Street Journal article Nordstrom--
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.240]   this is all anecdotal, but this gives you an idea.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:04.640]   Nordstrom has deployed 24,000 iPads at its 261 stores,
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.200]   replacing their point of sales machines.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.600]   Urban Outfitters, staff uses customized iPod
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.480]   touches to check out customers' handle returns
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.200]   in order out of stock products.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.400]   They've deployed more than 1,000 iPod touches
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.640]   at its stores, including Anthropology.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:20.320]   They refer to a Cranston-Rode Island jewelry chain.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.480]   I go there all the time.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.960]   Alex and Annie's known for its bangled bracelets.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.800]   They were using laptops running a web-based payment system.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.480]   They replaced them with iPod touches with a custom app.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.640]   They have 37 stores.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.480]   They said that their wait times dropped significantly
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.960]   from Mother's Day last year to Mother's Day in 2013.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.560]   Less than 10 minutes, same store revenue doubled
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.480]   because of the shift to iPod touches.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.320]   So that's all anecdotal, I admit.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.400]   But it's definitely a new world.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.320]   And it's bad for BlackBerry, probably bad for Microsoft,
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.320]   good for Google, good for Apple.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.960]   And really, it's good for users because it means diversity
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:01.640]   is OK.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.360]   You could choose the one you want.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.760]   I guess it's a horrible wind of fresh air
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.280]   to designers or companies that perhaps
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.320]   used to be patting themselves on the back saying,
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.480]   we've made the perfect device that people have responded
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.800]   to it because it is indeed the absolute--
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.720]   exactly what the future is supposed to be like
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.680]   and exactly attaching to their needs.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.240]   But then a new device like a tablet comes out
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.040]   or a really good powerful smartphone comes out.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.800]   And that's when you find out that the reason why people were
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.440]   buying your notebooks is not because you built the perfect notebook
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:36.600]   was simply because it was the only device that could handle
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.720]   the tasks that they had at that time.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.480]   And all along, that wasn't the device they really wanted.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.880]   It was just the only one that was available for sale.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.360]   And once you say, well, what if we take away the keyboard?
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.600]   What if we add battery life?
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.440]   What if we don't let you run desktop apps
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.240]   that will run apps that are good enough?
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.000]   And we sell it to you for $250.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.480]   Would that do it for you?
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.440]   Why, yes, it would.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.280]   Thank you very much.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.400]   Yes.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:01.280]   And again, you look at countries like here in Rwanda,
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.080]   the entire government, standard issue is an iPad.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.040]   Like that's what all the officials and everybody
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.360]   that you work with in ministry--
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.120]   Wow.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.960]   No, no, the entire government is iPad.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:10.480]   Wow.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.840]   Everybody has one that's it.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.320]   No one has a laptop.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.280]   They're all with one and around.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.600]   And they're just typing away.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.320]   They run the entire one in government and iPads.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.400]   Bad news for Apple.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.880]   Bad news for Apple.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.760]   Bad news for Apple.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:28.920]   They wanted to get their antitrust judge replaced.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.880]   We've talked before about the complaints Apple had
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.480]   about Michael Bromwich.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:36.240]   He was put in place by Judge Kote.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.640]   Apple felt that both Kote and Bromwich were biased against Apple.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.920]   This is all in the e-books case.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:46.720]   So bizarre.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:51.240]   Department of Justice has responded to Apple
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.240]   and their request that Bromwich be removed because he's
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.880]   anti-Apple.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:59.240]   The DOJ says regrettably it's now clear
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.000]   that Apple has chosen a campaign of character assassination
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.880]   over a culture of compliance.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.520]   Apple could-- this is the Department of Justice Attorneys.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.240]   Apple could have been spending the past months
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.440]   working with the external and the internal compliance
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.640]   monitor with the ultimate goal of reforming its policies
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.400]   and training.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.880]   And in the process, change its corporate tone
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.840]   to when they reflect a commitment to abiding
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.600]   by the requirements of antitrust law.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:28.400]   Instead, they focused on personally attacking Mr. Bromwich
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.200]   and thwarting him from performing even the most basic
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.680]   of his court-ordered functions.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.600]   Apple felt that Bromwich was overreaching.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:40.000]   He was trying to interview Apple execs not related
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   to the trial.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.600]   The judge denied the bid saying, no, Bromwich is there.
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:52.000]   You better live with it.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.680]   Well, it could be appealed.
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.080]   Oh, well, of course it could be appealed.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:55.800]   I mean, this is the reason--
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.840]   I'm guessing it will be appealed.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.480]   I mean, if you're Apple, this is a good way to just drag it out.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.720]   Well, I think Apple legitimately perhaps--
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.720]   but I think Apple definitely believes
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:12.200]   that both Judge Cote and Bromwich are acting in a biased fashion.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.160]   And the DOJ.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.120]   I mean, it's such a bizarre case.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.920]   You think it's one of those crazy William Shatner led
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.120]   trials from the TV shows.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.120]   I know.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.480]   Like, the judges are meeting with--
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.080]   Denny Crane.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:21.760]   --their old friend.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.040]   Yeah, absolutely Denny Crane.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:26.080]   Like, the judge and the guy is an old friend.
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.600]   And there's an uncle in Slate, too, where they basically said
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.760]   that Amazon was getting everything they wanted out of this,
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.160]   because now they're free to do--
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.160]   I mean, it's not that the government went after fixing
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:34.840]   the ebook industry.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:37.200]   They went after Apple and left Amazon all by itself,
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.360]   which struck some people the wrong court as well.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:42.920]   But the entire thing-- I mean, even if the stuff is incorrect,
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.880]   it looks like just for the sake of propriety and justice
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.240]   that they should at least appoint someone who's external
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.600]   to get involved at this point.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.640]   Well, the court just said, no, this is the guy you got.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.160]   You better work with him.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.560]   Well, the court so far.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.080]   So far.
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.240]   I mean, the thing is that-- and I think that also Apple
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.240]   has made it clear that they're going to take the offense on this.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.520]   And so I think that the other thing is--
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.360]   when we see this in Washington, DC, this little push and pull,
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.320]   Apple wouldn't have pushed and pulled if they didn't think
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.360]   they had a dog to hunt.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.040]   And so I think that they're--
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.920]   by doing this from a political perspective,
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.040]   I think it also allows them to put both the judge--
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.160]   I think the judge and the attorney probably stepped out
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.160]   of bounds somewhere.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.720]   And Apple probably has a pretty good idea that they did,
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.520]   or at least has a pretty good assumption that they did.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:28.200]   And I think that they're going to keep on trying to hide that.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:31.360]   And by doing that, that pushes them all back from Apple.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.200]   If there was any impropriety that has already been denied,
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.520]   that's called perjury.
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:39.560]   And so now, both of those folks, if they crossed any lines
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:42.680]   and if they lied about it, Apple has them in a vice,
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.280]   because they're just going to keep on pushing
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.960]   and they're going to keep on digging.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.000]   And it means that if he keeps on pushing in,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.240]   they have something to keep on wrapping around.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.480]   And so I think that--
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.440]   I mean, if I was Apple, I would do exactly the same thing.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.640]   I think you nailed Apple's strategy exactly on this.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.160]   And in fact, from the things Apple said,
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.680]   I think it's pretty clear they feel that both the judge
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.800]   and Bromwich have overstepped their bounds.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.640]   And I'm sure that they expect--
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.140]   Right.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:09.080]   I'm sure-- but even delaying it is good.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.600]   But I'm sure they expect at some point
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.680]   to get to a court that will agree with them
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:17.120]   and take Judge Cote off the case and replace Bromwich.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.120]   It's really hard for them to say that she was--
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.680]   I'll be taking off the case as being taken off the bench.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.080]   I mean, what do you think most of the way out?
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.080]   Right.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:24.920]   You're right.
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:27.640]   Now, I can see your dad's influence on this, by the way.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:32.200]   Do people know-- does he still work?
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.200]   Oh, no, no, my dad's still-- he's a very, very
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:35.920]   accomplished lawyer.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.040]   He was a federal prosecutor.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.520]   So--
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.480]   You know a little bit about what you're talking about here.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.960]   Yeah, well, I just-- this is something
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.480]   that when I was seven, we used to go to watch court cases
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:45.920]   about this.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.080]   And this is how people saying I never did this,
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.760]   and we never had these meetings, is how this always begins.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.800]   You know, and the thing is is that it--
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.280]   and so this is a very--
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.920]   I mean, I'm not saying that I don't know.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:56.480]   I wasn't there.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.560]   I don't know what happened.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:00.280]   But I'm saying that it really smells like someone
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.920]   stepped in the wrong--
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.560]   I got to say it's--
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.800]   I mean, I'm not an attorney, but that seems
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:10.760]   like an extraordinarily strongly worded letter from the DOJ.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.200]   So I think that's what I was saying.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.960]   I mean, it's one of those Oliver Ababish moments
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.920]   where, you know, if you lied, if you lied a little bit,
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.080]   if you lied once, that's game over.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.280]   The thing in the chatroom, people
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.640]   are saying that she formed an opinion
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.640]   before the trial started.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.080]   But in this case, that's her job.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.880]   She had all the evidence, and she'd
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.240]   formed a preliminary opinion, and then it's up to Apple,
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.600]   and the DOJ to argue the case.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.440]   So it's not that she was biased from the outset,
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.480]   but I think it's the questions that Alex mentioned
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.200]   about her friendship with the monitor, the amount he's
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.840]   charging, the fact that he wasn't experienced in the job
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.680]   that he was hired to do.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.600]   So he had to hire an outside person at his double the billing
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.160]   rate to do the job he was hired to do,
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.160]   and that he wanted to interview everybody from Johnny
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:51.240]   Ive to the janitor seemingly.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.680]   There's enough craziness going on that it makes something
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.240]   smell bad.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:54.920]   It does.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.400]   I feel the same way.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.960]   And we've talked about this before.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.800]   This is just yet another skirmish in the ongoing--
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.480]   And even if they didn't do anything illegal,
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.560]   Apple's just going to keep on making it smell until they get--
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.680]   they're going to try to make him give up
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.360]   by just continuing to drag it out.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.680]   And I'm sure that these guys can be
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.480]   assured that there are all kinds of private investigators
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.880]   and doing everything they can legally
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.640]   do to figure out what's going on and everything else about them.
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.560]   This is definitely personal, I think, for Apple.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.640]   I think they're going to--
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.320]   I feel wrong.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:22.840]   Hey, good news.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.080]   You've been waiting for it.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.520]   Aaron Sorkin has announced that he's completed the screenplay
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.920]   for the Steve Jobs biopic.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.200]   How many Sorkinisms are in it?
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:33.800]   Do we know yet?
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.800]   We don't know.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.280]   We don't know.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:38.880]   I'm trying to get the script from his trash.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.680]   I'm just going to go back to the Sorkinisms YouTube thing,
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:41.680]   and then I'm just going to write this.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.360]   So funny.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.400]   I was watching it this morning again.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.280]   Oh, my god.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:45.800]   Think?
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.000]   He's been-- I can't watch any of his stuff anymore,
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.360]   because I just--
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.040]   I'm just waiting.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.720]   Either I'm hearing it, or I'm waiting for it.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:55.280]   Took him almost two years to write this script.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:00.440]   He first got the job in the spring of 2012.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.360]   And here we are almost the spring of 2014.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.960]   And he's just--
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.120]   I think when he announced it is when Sorkinisms came out.
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.240]   And I think he decided he's going to try
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.440]   to write an entire script without his script.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:09.280]   And he's going to do that one.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:09.720]   And it just--
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:10.200]   He realized--
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:10.720]   So hard.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.220]   He realized--
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:11.720]   So hard.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.720]   He had newsroom--
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.400]   But the story came from the renewal of Newsroom for season
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.960]   three, which apparently was excruciating negotiation.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.240]   And in the last paragraph was, oh, by the way,
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.760]   he's also turned into that script.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:26.400]   The cut you're free, Steve Jobs movie.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.880]   As it will forever be known now.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:34.680]   We talked about this a little bit already on--
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.960]   was it on Twitch?
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:39.680]   The seventh anniversary of the iPhone announcement.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:42.520]   And I was thinking back, we even played a little bit
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.560]   of the announcement.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.040]   I think it was on Twitch, wasn't it, Chad?
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:52.680]   It was seven years ago this week that I think Alex, you
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:53.960]   were with me, right?
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960]   And Andy, were you there too?
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.840]   And you were there.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:57.760]   And you were there.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.880]   And you and you were there.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.440]   I was sitting next to Scott Borne, Alex Lindsey, Merlin
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.480]   Mann.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.920]   Remember, I mean, we were talking to Mac Break Weekly
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.320]   for months about an Apple phone, whether it
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.000]   would be called the iPhone.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.680]   Scott Borne was so convinced he was so excited.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:20.920]   Let me play a little bit of the keynote, because there's--
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:24.440]   I would say the moment in this keynote,
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:30.200]   when he first introduces the iPhone, today still gives me
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:30.720]   chills.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.360]   He made a keynote from a guy whose life was filled
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.320]   with great keynotes.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.240]   I think there's no doubt in my mind.
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.080]   And I think about the iPad--
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.080]   by the way, this is going to be the backbone of Aaron
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.360]   Sorkin's movie is announcements.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.480]   But not the ones we're thinking.
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.320]   The iPod announcement, the Macintosh announcement,
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:47.040]   according to what he said a year and a half ago at All Things
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.040]   D.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.440]   And the next Cube announcement, which is a very strange one
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:51.440]   to pick.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.640]   No, that's perfect.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:53.160]   Huh?
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:58.000]   I mean, Coach, if you're telling the story of Steve Jobs,
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.280]   and you omit the next Cube, you failed.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.880]   Because that's when he--
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.280]   next is the part of his life where he stopped being somebody
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.040]   who was part of--
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.560]   that did not have complete and total control over a company
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.400]   topped about him.
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.320]   And that's where he became the CEO.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:13.880]   Right.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:15.680]   It was his first CEO.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.680]   And maybe it's--
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.480]   No, I think he--
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:22.240]   I don't know why YouTube is--
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.680]   is this our bandwidth?
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.280]   Is it YouTube?
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.800]   I want to play this.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.600]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:30.760]   All the CES videos processing.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.800]   You know, if I had a Mac Pro right now,
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.960]   I probably wouldn't be having this trouble.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.760]   We had 60 up bandwidth at the hotel,
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:38.560]   and it was taking 40 minutes to upload a video,
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.960]   because YouTube was so backed up.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:45.640]   Let me see if I can find-- this is a seminal moment.
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.280]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:50.800]   All right, Steve Jobs.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:54.040]   And I wish there was a little video of you, me, and Scott
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.880]   born in the audience here reacting to this.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.560]   Can you hear the audio?
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:03.280]   In 2001, we introduced the first iPod.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.200]   And--
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:04.680]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:06.960]   --is, by the way, he plays the audience so well in this.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.360]   His sense of drama and timing is impeccable.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.120]   It changed the entire music industry.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:23.320]   Well, today, we're introducing three revolutionary products
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:23.920]   of this class.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.880]   Scott born goes, what?
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:33.560]   The first one is a wide screen iPod with touch controls.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.520]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.040]   The audience, I think, a little baffled at this point.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.400]   We're expecting an iPhone in that.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.040]   I mean, we don't know, for sure, but--
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:49.160]   The second is a revolutionary mobile phone.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.920]   That's the one Scott born in one.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.480]   We heard that, yeah.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.920]   And they're showing the interface.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.520]   That kind of everybody.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.040]   That's right.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.920]   That's the first time we saw that, isn't it?
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:04.120]   And the third is a breakthrough internet communications
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:04.680]   device.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.680]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.240]   Now they're really confused.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.040]   So really confused.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:11.640]   Watch these.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:12.720]   This is brilliant.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:15.440]   A wide screen iPod with touch controls,
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:19.280]   a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:19.960]   communication.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.920]   A keynote slide with just the word phone on it, of the eye.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:31.000]   An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.960]   An iPod, a phone.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:38.080]   Single greatest moment in keen and history right there.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.240]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:45.360]   These are not three separate devices.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.600]   This is one device.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.600]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:56.560]   And we are calling it iPhone.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:04.760]   Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:05.480]   And here it is.
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.600]   Very nicely done, I thought.
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.160]   Little joke.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.040]   He shows an iPod with a dial on.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:17.280]   Actually, as we learned from Fred Vogelstein's book Dog
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.320]   Fight, which has this whole--
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.680]   you've got to read, watch this keynote,
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:25.040]   and then read the backstory of all the iPhone developers
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.440]   in the front row, drinking heavily during this.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.160]   And apparently, the backstory of that
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.560]   is they did, in fact, consider an iPhone that
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.440]   would have the click wheel, it would look just like an iPod
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.400]   with the click wheel.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.600]   Tony Fadal's iPhone.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:43.280]   And just-- but you should seek that video out and play it
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.440]   all the way to the end and realize it.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.480]   But when that keynote was over, I was standing there.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.920]   I was cheering and jumping around.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.680]   And the first thing I thought was,
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:54.960]   if the last thing that Steve Jobs had said at the end of this keynote
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.160]   was now go out and kill in my name,
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.720]   that would have been a very bad day for San Francisco.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.680]   That would call a successful keynote.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:05.680]   The massive--
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.200]   And you look at that, and you look at that,
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:10.680]   and having one keynote, and when you talk to engineers
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:11.800]   that work on phones--
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:15.880]   we do a lot of stuff around phone engineers--
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:18.000]   all of them pretty much had to take
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.160]   whatever they were doing, throw it away, and start over again.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.640]   That's exactly what happened at Google.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.960]   That's what Fogelstein talks about in Dogfight
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:27.440]   is that Google engineers looked at it and said, oh.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:31.080]   And they threw out everything they'd done at that date.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:32.040]   That was it.
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:32.800]   And they weren't--
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:33.640]   And the ones that didn't--
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:34.640]   And the ones that didn't--
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:35.480]   They didn't warn them about going under.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.440]   Which is interesting.
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.680]   And Samsung said, quick, copy it.
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:44.880]   Pretty, pretty cool stuff.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.120]   Seven years ago.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.480]   It's been a fast seven years, hasn't it?
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.320]   All of those transitions we just talked about in business,
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:54.920]   the move to mobile, the move to touch, the internet of things.
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.120]   All of this has happened since then in seven years.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.280]   What an amazing era.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.400]   Aren't we lucky to live in this time?
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:00.900]   Nope.
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:03.200]   I think you wonder when you talk about future Apple products,
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.200]   if you put that sentence today, Apple reinvents the blank.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.000]   What word could you put there that would be as significant
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000]   as phone?
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:11.640]   The wristwatch.
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:12.960]   Just things about how people use technology.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:13.400]   I don't think so.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:14.680]   The wristwatch doesn't sound as big TV.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:15.480]   Doesn't sound as big.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:15.980]   No.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:16.800]   TV maybe.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.600]   How about the word home?
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.280]   See, that's where the nest acquisition is very strategically
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:25.920]   intriguing, to go full circle here,
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.720]   is that it's Google saying, we're
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:30.600]   going to reinvent the home, not Apple today.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.560]   That's very interesting.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.240]   I'll tell you how to use it.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.400]   We're going to take a break and come back with our tips--
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.480]   I'm sorry, our picks of the week in just a bit.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:43.800]   Andy Anaco Renee Ritchie, Alex Lindsey.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.760]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.560]   I'm looking at the screen saver on my Mac Pro.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.960]   And puts up the album art.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.200]   Can you see that?
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.480]   It puts up the album art.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.080]   It's like a lot of audible books.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.400]   I listened to some music, but a lot of audible books.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.480]   There's the Pete Townsend book, who I am.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:03.120]   Boy, that was a great book.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.880]   Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin, great book.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:08.120]   The Hours, great book.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.440]   I mean, I'm just thinking crime and punishment,
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.600]   the Dangerous Animals Club by Stephen Tobolowski.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.040]   That was your recommendation.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:15.880]   And he's--
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:16.400]   What was my favorite picks ever?
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.880]   My favorite audiobooks ever.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.960]   No easy day, the story of the SEAL team
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:24.280]   that God Osama bin Laden, the Iliad of Homer.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.280]   I listened to that when we went to Troy.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.040]   I loved walking through the walls of Troy
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.120]   listening to the Iliad.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.880]   That was a moment.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.320]   This is why I love audible.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.520]   Stephen King-- oh, The Gunslinger.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:37.680]   What a great book.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:39.360]   This is why I love audible.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.040]   I have been listening to audible books,
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.120]   audiobooksfromaudible.com.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.800]   Since 2000, I have over 500 books in my library.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.360]   That's a lot of them right there.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.400]   And to me, it's just a world of wonderful entertainment,
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.240]   of learning.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.720]   A great way to pass the time on that horrible commuter
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.680]   stuck in a plane for 12 hours, or even at the gym,
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:04.240]   on the treadmill.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.800]   I mean, as bad as being a plane for 12 hours is,
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.400]   being on the treadmill in the gym for an hour
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.440]   is pretty much right up there.
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:13.000]   But if I've got audible, it goes by like that.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.840]   But a few minutes extra on the treadmill,
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.880]   because I'm listening to a great book.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:20.320]   I want you to try audible.com with more than 150,000
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.200]   titles in every area.

[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.480]   You sure to find something you like?
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.160]   The trick is finding that one audiobook
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:33.560]   that I'm going to give you for free when you visit audible.com/mac.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.400]   Break, fortunately.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.440]   We have Andy Anaco with us.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.000]   And he's always recommending great books.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.080]   Before you do recommend your book,
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.480]   I do want to mention yesterday on triangulation,
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.520]   we interviewed Brad Stone about his book, which
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:45.880]   I've been listening to Audible.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:48.680]   It's the Everything Story of Amazon and Jeff Bezos.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.360]   And it's a great Audible.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.000]   Listen, and a great book.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.920]   So I'm going to recommend that.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:56.280]   And along with it, listen to our interview yesterday
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.120]   with the author, Brad Stone.
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.720]   Andy, what are you listening to?
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.360]   This is sort of a personal pick.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:03.880]   Well, it could be.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.000]   OK, they're all personal picks.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.280]   But I've recently become a little bit fascinated
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:13.720]   by Truman Capote, because after watching both of the biopics
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:16.640]   about him writing "In Cold Blood,"
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.640]   both movies really made the case that writing this book
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.720]   broke him about halfway.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.720]   And so I started reading a little bit about his life.
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.480]   And it turns out he wrote a second book that was also--
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.720]   that really, for some reason, just destroyed him.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.400]   The second one was a book called "Answered Prayers,"
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.760]   in which his social life was all about these New York
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.080]   high society women.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:44.360]   And so he wrote this thinly veiled novel in which he basically
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:47.640]   used every piece of gossip that they ever gave him
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:50.960]   and published it in a series of short stories for this book
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.760]   that he got a million dollar advance for.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.520]   But as soon as Esquire started excerpting early chapters
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.200]   from this, instantly he became a pariah in New York.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.520]   And so any story about Truman Capote
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:05.360]   becomes a discussion of why the hell did he write this book?
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:08.080]   Because he was Truman Capote!
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:08.600]   Exactly.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:09.760]   Well, again, it would be--
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:15.000]   And the discussion being split between that he literally
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.440]   did not-- he literally thought that the reason why
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:20.000]   all these society games were telling him this is gossip
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.680]   is because they knew that he was a writer.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.080]   They knew that he would use it.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:24.480]   It was all fair game.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.400]   And other people saying that, again, he was just broken
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:28.560]   at that point.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:32.160]   And he just-- this is part of the start of a self-destructive
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:35.320]   spiral that would take him all the way to an early grave.
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:38.440]   Sex, drugs, alcohol, everything.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.120]   Sounds good.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:39.120]   So this--
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.120]   Yeah, I'll take it.
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:41.120]   Exactly.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:44.040]   So this is a book all about that second book he wrote,
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.760]   "Answered Prayers," and again, getting into the world
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.400]   that he was living in at that time
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.040]   and speculating why he did it, what his motivations were,
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.400]   and what New York society life was like in the late '60s
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.960]   and mid '70s.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:59.960]   So this would almost be like this,
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.120]   the trilogy of books that I've--
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.920]   audiobooks that I've listened to about Truman Capote.
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.400]   The second one being a book about the black and white ball
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.880]   that he threw to celebrate the publication of "In Cold Blood,"
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.400]   which in itself was a pretty exciting book.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.200]   So there are books that I recommend
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:20.760]   because like "Dangerous Animals," it's just a fantastic book
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.760]   for everybody, 10 out of 10 out of everything.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:27.320]   This time, I'm really interested in this story.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.920]   I've got a lot of driving coming up,
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:31.040]   and so I know that this is going to be a good thing to listen to.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.240]   And also, it's narrated by Alex Hyde-White, which
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:35.800]   is one of my favorite narrators.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:37.240]   I'm fascinated by Truman Capote.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.240]   I totally share your interest.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.520]   And "In Cold Blood" is an amazing piece of journalism
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:45.800]   and to breakfast at Tiffany's, who can forget that.
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.200]   But I did not know this story about answered prayers
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.360]   and about self-destructing.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:53.400]   So I'm really, I can't wait to read this.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.560]   And it was one-- it was his unfinished book.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:00.240]   And it's also legendary because he promised everybody,
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.360]   he had written it, he'd shown the manuscript
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:03.360]   to people.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.360]   And yet, when he died, it was incomplete.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.720]   And nobody could find the complete manuscript
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:10.120]   that he had referred to that he had quoted from.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:13.120]   Again, it's not as though he was BSing people.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.880]   It was like, if he would come to people's houses,
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.720]   a friend to sort of bounce ideas off them.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.920]   And we would read multiple chapters.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:24.040]   So it's just part of the mystery of this book
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.040]   that, again, ruined a great writer, or excuse me,
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.040]   yet another weapon with which he decided
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.160]   to do suicide by society day.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.080]   Fascinating, tiny terror.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.320]   It's called.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:40.800]   And I share your fascination with Truman Capote.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.520]   I guess because I kind of-- I mean, you're not old enough.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:45.280]   But I grew up seeing him on "The Tonight Show"
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.360]   with Johnny Carson and stuff.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:50.040]   And he was quite a character in a celebrity.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.120]   And then you see his body of work, and you go,
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.680]   and he's actually a great writer.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.120]   Good choice.

[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:39.680]   That's part of that whole weird gunslinger series
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:42.040]   that I've never quite finished.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.200]   Legion, that was a great book.
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.200]   Really enjoyed that.
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.320]   It's kind of fun.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.280]   That's a nice screen saver.
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:51.440]   My alm-mart screen saver.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.520]   Let us get our--
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:53.520]   Commated you are, Leo.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.880]   I am an edgy, committed man.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.400]   I've read many books.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.440]   Listen to Def Jam and Johnny Cash together.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:03.480]   And that just kind of does it all for me.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:05.720]   I don't need to tell you what my pick of the week is.
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:08.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.040]   It's my baby.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:09.400]   Amen.
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:10.400]   Secret, precious.
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.000]   It's my baby.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.720]   I will do a full review of it before you
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.360]   buy later this afternoon.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:20.040]   Suffice to say, while I was skeptical,
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.480]   Apple really didn't knock it out of the park.
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.040]   It's a beautiful thing.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:25.840]   And you know the gaffers tape's good too.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:29.480]   Alex Lindsey in Killgolly Rwanda with the best connection
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.960]   of anybody.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.880]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.920]   So when I'm traveling, I always thinking about the whole--
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:39.960]   what we're traveling with.
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:42.240]   And one of the things that we have gotten into buying
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:43.840]   while we're traveling-- this is a little bit--
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:46.600]   this is when you're powering your Mac on the road.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.400]   All right, have you seen these?
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:48.640]   These are international--
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:50.480]   Oh.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.000]   Oh.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:52.520]   I know it's--
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.160]   So that handles any kind of plug.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.680]   Any kind of plug in 110 and 240.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:59.200]   So basically, you can plug it.
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.160]   You know, anytime you want to plug it in, you can plug it in.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.880]   So that's a universal power strip.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.240]   But what's on the other end?
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.480]   I mean, what do you plug it into?
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.840]   This one just has a regular--
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:07.680]   You can buy it on a phone.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:10.120]   So that would be for using international products in the US,
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:11.960]   because that's got a US plug on it.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:12.720]   It is.
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:14.360]   But what you can do is essentially--
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.840]   a lot of times when we're on the road,
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.480]   you may have things that you have locally and not locally.
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:21.000]   So anything about your bandwidth--
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.680]   Oh, it's fine, it's fine.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.640]   What happened?
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:25.680]   Everybody went to school.
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.280]   What time is it at Gilgali?
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.080]   It is--
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:29.760]   What time is it?
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.040]   It's almost 11 o'clock.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.800]   At night or in the morning?
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:33.320]   At night?
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.720]   Oh.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:36.280]   But I've been having trouble with my-- actually,
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.600]   I've been having trouble with my webcam.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.120]   So it might actually be something else.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.000]   It keeps on popping.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.120]   So we'll see how this goes.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.240]   That is a really interesting product.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:49.200]   So it's a power strip with international plugs.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:53.640]   So what you can do is you can, of course, buy any kind of little
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.780]   adapter for $10 that I'll convert to anything I'm going to plug into.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:58.540]   So what I do is I get those, and then I get this.
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:03.020]   And that means that basically I can plug anything into here.
[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:05.920]   So if someone else has a charger that they want to use,
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:09.120]   or if we're with a crew, and we can just plug anything in--
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:12.620]   and by the way, there's hotel rooms with these in the walls,
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.040]   and that is the way to go.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.000]   I don't know how any hotel room doesn't just
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.260]   put this plug into the walls, because it just
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:22.340]   gives everybody visiting can make it work.
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:25.000]   The other thing that I think I've talked about before,
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.320]   but I'm probably-- these are--
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:28.840]   I just broke out.
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.360]   These are the Q2D operations.
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:34.600]   See, these are different My files.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.040]   So this is just the one I use in the US.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:42.240]   This is the Verizon LTE one that I use.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.240]   And then this one is the one that you can get.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.640]   It doesn't matter which one you get.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.520]   It depends on what country.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:49.160]   Now, when I go into countries, I buy almost every country.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.300]   Then if I think I'm going to come back,
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.740]   I'm sure that I could try to figure out
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:54.300]   Sims and everything else.
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:57.420]   But what I do is I buy one so that I always have this.
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:01.400]   The last time I didn't have one in Rwanda, and the bill was--
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:02.700]   yeah, it was bad.
[01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:04.100]   It was really bad.
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:08.580]   And $2,200 or something like that in phone calls.
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:11.700]   So what you do is, of course, you use this,
[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:13.660]   and then you use FaceTime Audio.
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:17.060]   I meet everyone on Go to Meeting.
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:18.740]   I can do a lot of things to do FaceTime.
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:19.740]   All those other things.
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.220]   And so by having one of these, you
[01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:22.500]   don't worry as much about your minutes.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:24.060]   You just make sure that you kind of change a little bit
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:24.660]   of your lifestyle.
[01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:29.060]   You make all those phone calls without spending a penny on it.
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:30.740]   And of course, all your eye messages
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:33.180]   go through to all your iPhone friends.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.140]   So these are just key.
[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:37.180]   And the most important about this is that if anyone asks you,
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:38.660]   you can put these in your back pocket
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:40.480]   and you always, whenever necessary,
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.260]   can just say, I've got bandwidth coming up my hands.
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:42.740]   Would you like to--
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:44.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:50.900]   OK, I was explaining what a Shaggy Dog story was
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.020]   to Michael the other day.
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:53.540]   That was a Shaggy Dog story.
[01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:57.420]   A long way to go for a pun.
[01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:58.660]   Silly punchline.
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:01.900]   I've got bandwidth coming out of my ass.
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:02.940]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:03.580]   Let's see.
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:04.620]   Exactly.
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:06.620]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:07.260]   I have two.
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:09.260]   I have one that's a little self-serving at first.
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:11.420]   We launched another-- a new website,
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:14.260]   because WebOS Nation is now on blocks up
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:16.660]   in our smartphone experts driveway.
[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:17.780]   We're not doing much of that anymore.
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:19.820]   Crackberry is not as busy as it used to be.
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:22.700]   So we took the guy who was managing Crackberry, Adam Zeiss.
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:25.300]   And he started a news site for us called SmartWatchFans.
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:27.740]   Oh, you were looking ahead.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:32.140]   Yeah, I mean, CES, they had a whole wrist power pavilion.
[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:34.180]   They had the Pebble Steel announcement.
[01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:37.180]   They had more smartwatches than I could keep track of.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:37.820]   And I was lucky.
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:42.300]   I didn't have to, because Adam was doing it all on SmartWatchFans.
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:46.420]   We also went down to Palo Alto when I came up
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:47.980]   to Petaluma that day.
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:51.020]   And we interviewed Pebble, and we did interviews with everybody.
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:54.020]   So this is going to be where we put all our SmartWatch coverage
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:55.460]   going forward.
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:56.780]   So that's an interesting choice.
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:58.180]   It's a fairly narrow vertical.
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:00.300]   Instead of saying a wearables site,
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.020]   you said, we're going to go with fans.
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.620]   Is that your experience that the more narrow, the more likely
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:06.420]   you're going to build a crowd?
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:08.380]   Yeah, well, our sites are always community driven.
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:09.940]   I mean, we started with Visor Central,
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:10.860]   and that was--
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:11.380]   Right.
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:12.380]   --and we started with Intrillo Central.
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:14.260]   And it's always been about the community.
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:15.900]   And those people tend to want to talk
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:19.060]   with people about specific things.
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:20.540]   Because otherwise, there's been a lot of time fighting.
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:22.080]   And yeah, they don't mind fighting
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:23.220]   about which iPhone you get.
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:25.420]   But it's better than the perpetual battle between iPhone
[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:26.340]   and not, you know?
[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:28.020]   And that's an interesting point.
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:32.020]   The community be less fractious if you're more narrowly focused.
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.900]   It has its pros and cons, because, for example,
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:37.260]   if you put all our sites together, we're fairly large,
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.540]   but no one sees us that way.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:41.180]   So it ends up looking like a bunch of niche sites.
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:43.420]   So there's pros and cons, but so far, this approach
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:44.660]   has really worked for us.
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:46.060]   And we wanted to start another site,
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:49.700]   and we managed to squeak it through right at New Year's.
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:52.940]   So it's where I'm going now for all my smartphone stuff.
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.620]   And it's going to have a lot of great coverage, especially
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:57.940]   coming out of CES with all the new watches that were announced.
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:01.860]   So if I'm more.com Android Central, Crackberry--
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:04.420]   not so busy these days--
[01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:08.140]   Windows, Phone Central, WP Central, and Smart Watches--
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:11.860]   is at smartwatchfans.com.
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:14.740]   And you said there's a new one, a mobile phone one?
[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:16.820]   Well, the new one is Smart Watchfans.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:17.620]   That's the latest site.
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:18.660]   We launched it on New Year's.
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:19.940]   OK, cool.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:20.780]   Congratulations.
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:22.340]   My other pick of the week-- yes.
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.460]   My other pick of the week is I looked-- I actually searched this up
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:26.780]   and I picked it before, and it was the same time of year.
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:28.500]   And I knew immediately why.
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:29.700]   But it's Tripit Pro.
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:32.900]   And it's because I start the trade show season,
[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:34.340]   and I start traveling.
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:36.460]   And so far, nothing has been better for me
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:38.540]   to keep track of all that stuff than Tripit Pro.
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:41.020]   I get a reservation for a plane or for a hotel.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:43.380]   I email it to Tripit Pro.
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:44.700]   And then it just takes care of it.
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:48.020]   And I have my most recent trip up on my iPhone screen now.
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:50.260]   And it is bright red from delays.
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:52.580]   And it has never failed to alert me,
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:55.900]   not only before the airline does, but hours and hours
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:58.100]   before the airline does about delays.
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:00.060]   So in Vegas, I didn't even go to the airport,
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:02.740]   because Air Canada told me the flight was fine.
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:05.580]   Tripit told me that it was two hours and then three hours
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:06.340]   delayed.
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:07.980]   And if I'd just been listening to the airport,
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.460]   to the airline-- sorry-- I would have been sitting at the airport
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:12.860]   waiting instead of sitting in a Vegas hotel waiting.
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:14.820]   And I pay for Tripit Pro.
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:16.820]   I pay for the ad-free app.
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:20.180]   They have more than made up for the small subscription fee
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:21.820]   that they charge.
[01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:24.020]   And I just don't go traveling without it anymore.
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:28.980]   All my reservations, all my trips are a couple taps away.
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:30.260]   So I'm on my trip--
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:31.100]   Go ahead.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:31.600]   Go ahead.
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:32.700]   You travel a lot, Alex.
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:35.620]   So I know you probably have a lot of things to say about this.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:37.180]   I've compared a lot of them, and I'm
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:39.020]   happy with Tripit Pro as well.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:41.140]   So Tripit Pro is the one that I've been using.
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:44.060]   And the other thing is, one of the things we're looking at
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:45.940]   is, I guess, they have a whole admin tool.
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:47.780]   So if you have a bunch of people in your company,
[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:49.340]   you can actually have someone administering them
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:51.020]   and managing everybody's trip it, knowing
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:52.300]   what everybody is and everything else.
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:53.940]   And that's what we're about to move into.
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:54.820]   Isn't that handy?
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:57.020]   You can also share, like Phil Nickinson from Android,
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.020]   Sight, and I are buddies, so we can see each other's trips,
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.420]   because we travel a lot.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.380]   And if you want to, if you're comfortable doing it,
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:03.860]   you can share your Gmail credentials,
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:05.700]   and you don't even have to forward stuff to trip it.
[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:08.220]   It'll just pull that stuff out of your Gmail as you get it.
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:10.260]   That's what I do.
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:13.860]   And there's a little bit of social stuff.
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:17.180]   So I'm in second place for the number of countries
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:19.500]   visited after Neil Morales.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:21.060]   But apparently, I'm not following Alex,
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:23.620]   because he'd probably be number one there.
[01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:28.180]   I've traveled 247,123 miles to 68 locations.
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:31.620]   I'm going to add you, Renee, to my Tripit friends.
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:34.980]   So I can compete with you.
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:35.700]   I love Tripit.
[01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:36.420]   I really do.
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:37.020]   It's so great.
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:37.540]   It's fantastic.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.040]   What is it?
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.700]   The Proke isn't that expensive.
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:42.340]   No, and they redesigned their iOS app now for iOS 7,
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:44.980]   and it's got a card-based interface that is really nice.
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:47.220]   I mean, everything is-- when you're moving through an airport,
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:48.900]   the last thing you want to do is have to start looking
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:50.340]   for small amounts of text.
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:51.980]   So the cards are really glanceable.
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:53.220]   It gives you all the information.
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:55.740]   I can typically find my flight number, my reservation number,
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:58.460]   faster on Tripit than I can on the tickets or the email stuff.
[01:51:58.460 --> 01:51:59.900]   So it's, again--
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:00.540]   I can't--
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:01.580]   Yeah, I live on it.
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:05.220]   And I don't travel anywhere near as much as you and Alex do.
[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:06.540]   Nobody has to do my start.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:07.780]   [LAUGHS]
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:10.660]   When I started business traveling like at age 19 or 20,
[01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:13.980]   I really wish that now that I had taken a picture of everything
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:16.100]   that I carried in my bags and everything
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:19.020]   that I carried in my pockets when I left for an airport
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:21.940]   and could just cross off 90% of that stuff
[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:24.340]   I don't need to take anymore.
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:26.420]   All the way from the alligator clips
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:29.180]   that get me to plug into whatever hotel phone system is
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.980]   in there, all the way to-- here's all the pieces of paper
[01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:33.740]   that I need, the tickets that I need to make sure
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:36.140]   that I pick up, the information I need to have handy,
[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:38.300]   because, yeah, Tripit is like magical.
[01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:39.700]   You pull out this one app.
[01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:42.140]   You take-- tap this one button.
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:44.900]   It recognizes that, oh, today's the day you're taking off.
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:46.780]   So I bet you're really interested in seeing
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:50.420]   how your flight to San Francisco is doing.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:51.100]   Marvel stuff.
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.060]   Finally, Alex-- I'm sorry, Andy and I,
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.820]   oh, you're pick of the week.
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:59.060]   My pick is a website called instantwatcher.com,
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:01.660]   which is invaluable for your--
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:04.220]   if you're a Netflix subscriber.
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:07.860]   Because it's a much, much easier and more flexible way
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:10.740]   of seeing what's available on the service than anything
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:13.220]   that any of the Netflix apps let you do.
[01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:16.220]   And for me, the big deal is that one tab at the very beginning
[01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:18.580]   that simply says, new.
[01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:20.420]   So it will show you everything that's
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:22.140]   been recently added to Netflix.
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:25.580]   Because as you know, they have packaged deals
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:27.340]   that keep coming in and coming out.
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:29.500]   And so they'll lose a whole bunch of Disney movies.
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:32.340]   But then they'll get back in, "Raging Bull,"
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:35.500]   and two Mel Brooks movies and some like it hot.
[01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:38.140]   And you might not even know that they're available.
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:41.500]   There's a Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie.
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:44.380]   There's Amelie, which I haven't seen in years.
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:46.980]   I wouldn't have known it was on Netflix until I saw that, oh,
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:50.340]   look, it's just arrived back on January 1.
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.820]   And leave it to Beaver season six.
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:55.300]   For long, long missed.
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:59.220]   If you go to page four, now they have all 12 seasons
[01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:00.460]   of Murder She Road.
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:03.260]   And before you get too excited about that,
[01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:05.020]   six My Little Pony Special.
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:08.540]   A very minty Christmas, dancing in the clouds.
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.460]   Friends are never far away.
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:15.180]   The Princess promenade and the runaway rainbow.
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:19.100]   Plus a special bonus, Tinkle Wish Adventure.
[01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:19.540]   Wow.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:22.140]   No, that's twinkle Wish Adventure.
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:23.500]   That's a very different--
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:24.300]   That's a very different--
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:26.900]   --for being service all together.
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:29.100]   "Raging Bull" is now on Netflix.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:29.900]   See, I wouldn't have known that.
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.060]   That's awesome.
[01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:31.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:35.300]   And even for stuff that's already--
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:36.940]   that's been on there for a while.
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:40.380]   It's just so easy to just click on buttons and browse
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.020]   by category.
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:44.620]   They also have categories for New York Times critics picks.
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:46.820]   Rotten Middo is rated fresh.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:48.540]   So then it's--
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:50.500]   I don't know why Netflix doesn't just
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:52.460]   make this part of their site, because as it is,
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:54.900]   it's just too hard to find.
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:56.620]   They'll recommend things for you,
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:58.060]   and that it works kind of OK.
[01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:00.780]   But there's just something so--
[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:03.860]   as disgustingly analog as it is,
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:05.340]   just simply scroll through a list
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:07.340]   and look for things that leap out at you,
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:10.260]   that's how you find a lot of great movies.
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:11.860]   I use the Canadian version of this.
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:14.500]   And to outtown these point, I go on Netflix,
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:16.620]   and I look at-- it's so confusing.
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:18.140]   Latest added new features.
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:19.460]   And none of them are actually new.
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:20.540]   I've seen them there for months.
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:22.700]   So I go to a website like this, and it just shows me
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:23.140]   everything.
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:24.620]   And I find almost something immediately.
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:26.260]   I think I just started watching "Covid Affairs"
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:27.940]   last week, because I found it there.
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:30.340]   And still can find it on the Netflix site.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:33.100]   Wow, this is really great.
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:35.220]   Instantwatcher.com.
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:35.740]   Great pick.
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:37.180]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:39.460]   I much appreciate that.
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:42.140]   Friends, that concludes this edition of "Mac Break Weekly."
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:44.220]   Thank you to Renee Ritchie, iMore.com.
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.140]   And of course, the new site.
[01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:49.500]   SmartWatch today--
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:50.580]   SmartWatchFans.com.
[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.580]   SmartWatchFans.
[01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:53.820]   We were joking, because at CES, no one could get it right.
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:55.500]   People were calling it SmartPhone fans.
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.740]   People were calling it SmartWatchPhoneFans.com.
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:00.820]   So we just started joking, you know, smartwatchphones.co.uk.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:03.540]   You know, make it as long as possible.
[01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:08.020]   SmartWatchFans.com.
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:08.620]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:09.500]   Great to see you again.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.580]   Alex Lindsey, enjoy your evening and kill
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:15.180]   Golly, you're free now for a few more hours.
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:21.420]   And if anyone is interested, I did a bunch of all my reviews
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.580]   at CES with Glass.
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:24.780]   And it'd be really fun to get people's feedback on it.
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:26.340]   It's on my G+ page.
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:28.860]   And so I chopped the whole thing with Glass.
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:30.300]   And it was actually--
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:31.660]   I think it actually worked out pretty well.
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:34.580]   But definitely take a look at him and let me know what you think.
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:39.580]   He's plus Alex Lindsey, L-I-N-D-S-A-Y on Google+.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:43.540]   And yeah, really, I think a great way to do it.
[01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:44.420]   Yeah, it works really well.
[01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:46.540]   You have a lot of--
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:47.780]   you have your hands back.
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:50.980]   And what it was surprising, I was really in loud environments.
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:54.660]   And I was able to--
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:55.980]   I didn't use anything extra.
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:57.100]   I just literally just shot it.
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:58.300]   And I was really surprised.
[01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:00.620]   The audio isn't perfect, but it was a lot better than I expected.
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:01.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:03.620]   This is--
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:04.700]   A lot of people--
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:08.300]   I posted some side by side by side comparisons of photos,
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:11.300]   just getting people's opinions on which photo do you like best.
[01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:13.900]   And I tossed in a couple of Google Glass photos.
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:15.660]   And I'm surprised at how many people
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:17.660]   liked that specific photo better than they
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:20.900]   liked the iPhone 5S photo.
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:22.900]   This takes some really great stuff.
[01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:26.260]   I got the new version of Glass and it's broken.
[01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:26.740]   It doesn't work.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:27.740]   Oh, no.
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:28.740]   Oh, man.
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:31.740]   I have to go back to the salon.
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:34.100]   I think you're the bad luck, Andy.
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:35.900]   Break your glass.
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:36.660]   Stupid.
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:38.300]   Break your mother's back.
