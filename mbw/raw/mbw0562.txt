[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.640]   Good morning, afternoon or evening.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.040]   And it's the epic one day after the WWDC keynote.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.560]   And I have assembled a murderers row of developers because I've been left all alone bereft
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.520]   and abandoned, like Collette at the start of that play that I've never actually seen.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.480]   Yes, Leo is out on vacation.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.760]   Renee is off at WWDC, up to his armpits or someplace lower in top secret briefings.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.880]   And Alex is just being top secret to begin with because he has such a cool, cool career
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   that way.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.280]   But once again, I've got three developers to talk about developer stuff.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.760]   And also, developers spend money too.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.520]   So they're consumers too.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.440]   Welcome back, Kelly Guimont of App Camp for Girls.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440]   Kelly, hello again.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.920]   Hi, it's nice to see you again, Andy.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.640]   It's been an age.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.640]   It's been an age.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.440]   We tend to show up on a lot of podcasts together.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.080]   So I'm glad to see the feedback that happens.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.760]   I should point out that Kelly is very, very happily ensconced with a partner.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.960]   So no, it's not that we're dating or anything like that.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.200]   I just, I just, yeah, there just been enough tweets about that to say, no.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   It's cheap.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.400]   Wow, I only saw one.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   So I had no idea.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.280]   Oh, I got a couple more.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.400]   So I was saying that the reason why Kelly tends to, because Kelly has also been showing
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.360]   up a lot on the material podcast, chiefly because we lost our third, our third regular.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.960]   And so we've been sort of inviting our friends from time to time to come on in.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.880]   And because Kelly is quite awesome in the podcast here, like having her own podcast,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.440]   she makes me look very, very good.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   So she tends to get invited a lot.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.800]   So let's see how quickly we can get you sick of me and me sick of you on these things.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.080]   But brand new is Janie Clayton, the author of the metal programming guide.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.600]   And oh my God, what a great pick you were for the show.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   Yay.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.000]   Really excited to be here.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.160]   Well, I keep, I keep hearing what time zone are you in?
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.040]   I'm in central time zone.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.280]   So I'm like Chicago.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   Okay.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   So that's not bad.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.440]   So let's see how we do with Oliver.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.120]   We've got Oliver Bridenbach of Boink Software all the way across the ocean.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.120]   This is the end of a long day for you.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.880]   Or are you just getting up from a very, very long previous day?
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.880]   It's the end of a long day.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's evening getting dark outside.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.120]   I rely on artificial lighting here.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.080]   That's okay.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.080]   We will be your nightcap.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.360]   We will be your glass of warm milk that puts you to bed very, very quickly.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.040]   Hopefully not for the listeners though.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.600]   But let's, let's, let's, why the podcast is going on.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.160]   Well, again, if you do want to doze off, make sure you lean into the mic as you start
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.400]   snoring because again, it's all about viral content.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   We can cut this to our long show down to two and a half minutes of viral clips that
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.880]   gets us so many more followers.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.880]   That works for us too.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.040]   We're here to educate, to inform, to elevate the discussion and to make people think more
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.280]   about the stuff that they use every day.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.920]   But we also like advertiser dollars.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.280]   So there's always sort of like a middle myiosis sort of thing going on there.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.120]   Let's start off with just the, what we're, I got an outline of all the, all the really,
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.840]   this was a pretty good one, I thought, as a keynote goes.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.480]   Lots of, not just specifically cool stuff to think about and maybe buy and maybe not be
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.320]   able to afford 100,000 years, iMac Pro, but also some interesting things showing off what
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.480]   Apple wants to be doing over the next couple of years.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.720]   But overall, let's just go around and talk about the basic question.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.400]   What did we think about this keynote and are we happy?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.760]   And because Kelly, you are right next to me in this, in this four up display.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.560]   I think you're going to go first.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   Okay.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.240]   Um, I liked it.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.520]   And more than that, I didn't really see the stuff that I didn't see holes in what it was
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.320]   said and, and talked about that are going to make people upset.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.880]   I mean, we've already heard about a Mac Pro.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.920]   So everybody talking about they're not being a Mac Pro.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.880]   Like, do you remember anything from the last month?
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.560]   Because we already knew that was on, on the slate, we just haven't seen it yet.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.880]   One thing that was notable to me was the announce where, not stuff that's shipping next week
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.480]   or next month, but not till the end of the year, even we did get a look at a couple of
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.200]   things that are way, way down the calendar from now.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.560]   And I thought that that was pretty notable.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.040]   But otherwise I was, I was mostly satisfied.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.200]   There was a small Apple TV shaped hole in the presentation, but otherwise I thought it
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   was good.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.520]   Yeah, there were a few holes in that.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   We'll get to that.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.600]   Hopefully at the end of the show, but Janie, what did you think?
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   Oh my God.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.240]   Like I was flipping out.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.360]   I was really just excited about everything that I saw the first, like half of the, half
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.800]   of the keynote, like I just, I was also leading back and forth between like, Oh my God, this
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.760]   is blowing my mind to, Oh crap, I'm going to have to go and like write about this in my
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   book.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.440]   Oh, like I've got a couple of weeks ago and figure out what I just, Apple, Apple excels
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   at that screwing.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.760]   That's why I stopped writing books like three years ago.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.080]   It's like, great, this is done.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   It's perfect.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   I'm proud of this.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080]   Oh, what's this in my inbox?
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.080]   Oh gosh darn it.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:54.600]   Well, I thought it was funny because I had, I started writing my first book back in 2014
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.080]   and I was really cocky and I was watching the keynote then.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.640]   I'm like, okay, this stuff looks really cool.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.640]   Oh, hey, they're introducing metal.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   That looks really awesome.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.680]   And then they had like the one more thing where they announced Swift and I was like,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.240]   Oh God, I'm writing my first programming book and I have to learn this brand new language
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.720]   and I have done and that just completely blew my mind.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.680]   And I felt a lot of deja vu and watching a lot of the keynote this year was like, Wow,
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.960]   they're giving me everything that I've wanted for the last like three years and it's all
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.320]   coming here at once.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.200]   And now I have to actually like step up and actually get out into the world.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.600]   And I, wow.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:39.000]   Yeah, I think that WDC is famous for to for ruining two people's hopes and unpleasantness.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.720]   A, people who have to write about stuff and have been working on a project like that for
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.120]   three months and also hardware and software developers that said, Wow, I'm really, really
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.200]   proud of this watch app that lets you have like a sort of a safety light, you know, so
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.960]   that not only is it the screen illuminated, but also key.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.840]   Well, that was a good two months of my life.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   All right.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.600]   So that comes free with every watch.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.920]   I have four months in which to either destroy Apple and prevent them from releasing this
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.000]   or make money off of my one app.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.200]   Oh, well, Oliver, how about you?
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:16.640]   Yeah, luckily we didn't fall into the later category this time.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:25.920]   I thought it was certainly the most interesting keynote in recent years.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:34.360]   I think Apple got a wake up call last fall when Microsoft came up with the studio with
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   the Surface Studio thing.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:50.040]   And they tried really hard to bring back that, you know, we are making cool stuff feeling.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.840]   And I think they succeeded quite well.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.560]   So yeah, I liked it.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   I liked it.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.640]   Yeah, I thought it was a strong keynote.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.040]   But I think you're right.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.920]   And one of the things I was thinking as it was going on was that I really felt the pressure
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.320]   that maybe Apple was feeling as they were assembling all this stuff they're going to
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.400]   talk about because like you said, Microsoft has, they're not the top of the tree in terms
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.680]   of innovation, but they've come out in the past year with a couple of really cool, flashy
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.400]   sort of things that just as a sort of thing that you walk past a store window in a mall
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.120]   would make you detour into the store to see what that notebook that's covered with felt
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.520]   is all about in the Surface Studio.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.960]   Meanwhile, Google had their IO keynote a couple of weeks ago where they're saying, we've got
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.120]   we've got our official intelligence that's going to solve all kinds of problems.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.600]   You see that fence between you and the and your kid and that photo book, the fence is
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   gone.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.960]   Hey, you know how you don't you're walking underneath a sign and you don't know what
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   band that is.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.480]   It'll explain what that's what who's in that sign and when they're playing.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.720]   And so it's I don't think that the keynote was necessarily a reaction to that, but I think
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.080]   that this may be last week, they decided to find every place they could put the phrase
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.760]   machine learning into a slide or into part of the talk.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.680]   They're halfway through my my life tweets.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.120]   I was saying, look, if you're playing the machine learning drinking game, where you take a drink
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.600]   every time you hear that phrase, get down off that flagpole, put your clothes back on
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.440]   before somebody arrests you because it was kind of that bad.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.480]   And some of the demos in the are a are space.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:29.560]   They seemed like they were copies of the F eight keynote in Facebook.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.360]   Yeah, and Facebook too.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.200]   We'll get to we'll get to a are a little bit later, though.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.320]   I did want to make sure because we were blessed to have three different developers here, how
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.000]   there are things that I really can't really evaluate like improvements to the app store
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.200]   and improvements to the developer Apple relationship.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.960]   They made a big they made a big section about how they're improving the app store with they're
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.600]   making app reviews happen a lot faster.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.280]   They're making more make it more conversational.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.320]   They're improving the app store app on iOS so that it makes it easier if you're not making
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.520]   a game to somehow get people's attention and better product pages.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.720]   Oliver, do you see anything that would make the boyks off where happier and better and
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.040]   easier to get their job done with all these changes?
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:24.720]   So in the last couple of years, maybe like two or so, Apple has constantly improved the
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.480]   experience of putting stuff on the app stores.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   So faster review times now the ability to be able to respond to customer ratings and that
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.720]   kind of stuff.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.080]   And it keeps coming.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.360]   The good stuff keeps coming.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:50.400]   So and I think the app store redesign was long overdue and it looks nice.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:59.720]   I remain on the sidelines a little bit of if it's going to help developers in the end.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:06.080]   It's certainly a good thing for customers.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.040]   And that's important thing first of all.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:16.120]   The customer comes first of course and it follows that it should be good for developers
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:24.080]   too but it remains to be seen how easy it is to get new apps in there, get visibility
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.560]   for existing apps and stuff like that.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:36.320]   Apple seems to have chosen to do a lot more manual work with actual people curating content
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:43.960]   for the app store which is a good thing but also you're as a developer, you want more
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.480]   at Apple's mercy than ever regarding being featured.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.960]   And so it looks nice.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   It's changes always a two edged sword but I'm hopeful that it's actually improving our
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   lives.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.800]   >> Yeah, to be honest I don't think I've ever heard of Apple and developers having a good
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   relationship.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.880]   If you talk to developers there's always something that is always falling far, far short.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.800]   Kelly you're in an interesting position because you are not just a developer.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.400]   You're also developer who helps like brand new programmers under the age of 16 get their
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.080]   first apps out there and in the app store.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.520]   How do you coach them to say that now everything's been fun and wonderful and creative?
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.240]   The center of your creative universe right now, now let me introduce you to the app store
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.840]   process.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.880]   Where does Apple still need to fix things?
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.960]   >> Well, first of all, I really liked the stuff that we saw in the store and that was
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:57.160]   actually for me the only part of the keynote yesterday that cost me money.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.120]   And that's because they showed off Monument Valley 2 and I freaked out and stopped listening
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.080]   for a couple minutes because I went and bought Monument Valley 2 and then I came back.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.640]   But I don't need a new computer and I don't need a new speaker and I don't need, I kind
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.320]   of want a new iPad but I don't need a new iPad.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:21.040]   So for me, the only part that was actually expensive was the Monument Valley 2 stuff.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:29.080]   But what we do is we don't really talk a whole lot about the app store itself as part
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.600]   of Appcamp when we are talking about Appcamp and we talk about how to distribute your apps.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.080]   What we talk about is sort of in broad strokes because what we want to do is get our developers
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:46.720]   excited about programming and about what parts of programming are the parts that maybe make
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   you happy.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.480]   Not everybody understands that breaking stuff is a really important part of programming
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.680]   particularly if you're new to it, if you haven't spent a lot of time or you don't know a lot
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.800]   of developers and a lot of high school girls don't know a ton of iOS developers so they
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.560]   don't know that like there's this whole job that's like the art of breaking stuff the
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.200]   way regular people would break stuff and being able to file those reports so that what you
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.120]   release turns out to be something really good for users.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:18.800]   So what we do is we take all of the apps that are built it, all of the camps throughout
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.640]   the summer and we put them together and we throw ourselves on that iTunes Connect Hand
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.600]   grenade for them.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.200]   That's very good and gracious.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   I'm amazed you're still alive.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.920]   Well I don't do the heavy lifting on that.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.960]   I do some of the hooking things up to P-lists and some really sort of fine detail work so
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.520]   I'm not the personalxerless to push the button but finding out that reviews are going faster
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:50.160]   and some of the other stuff it sort of felt like paid search results were a step away from
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.040]   having a good relationship from developers and some of the stuff that they talked about
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.600]   yesterday feels like they're extending some of that all of Brant again.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.440]   Jenny have you ever had a lot of experience dealing with the app store like any frustrations
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.040]   or any problems that you think that needs still need to be solved?
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.800]   It seems like everybody seems to have the same.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.040]   It all comes down to like one huge problem they once had that turned off the taps of
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.640]   their access to their own app and I don't know how well Apple's doing and making sure
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.600]   that sort of stuff doesn't happen anymore.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   There we go.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   Oh, wrong.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   Well, so.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.600]   You're good.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:29.480]   I started programming back in about 2012 so I got in right towards the end of the gold
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:35.280]   rush so like everybody expected you to have an app out on the store but I started programming
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.440]   relatively later in life.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.760]   I started when I was like 31 and so I've been programming for the last four years and
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.800]   I feel like every single time I want to try to create an app it's always just one step
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.760]   beyond my current capability because it used to be before it you could just make anything
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.040]   you can make a flashlight app you can make a fart app and you can put it out there on
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.080]   the store you know six years ago and that was totally fine but now they've been cracking
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.320]   down and they want things that are really polished.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.240]   There's a lot of expectation that an app is supposed to have a lot of different features
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.680]   and there's a lot of different stuff and I work on this stuff by myself and so the amount
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.520]   of work that I can do by myself along with everything else that I'm doing is not enough
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.320]   for me to be able to get anything done before you know WWDC comes and blows everything up
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.280]   and so like I find it very frustrating because like I want to put something out on the store
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.840]   but they keep they keep moving the line further than where I'm able to do it at the moment
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.200]   it's very frustrating.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:34.560]   I mean I appreciate that the app store has gotten to be mature enough that they have actual
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.880]   real applications and standards and they want things that were worked on by a team of five
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.040]   people over a course of like nine months and are tested and polished and look really awesome
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.720]   because they want to have a nice store but it's also really frustrating because you talk
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.640]   to employers and they're like well you don't have an app on the store and even though you
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.600]   wrote like all of these books we don't know that you can actually code it's like ugh.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:02.520]   Yeah there's a lot of RESPECT that needs to happen I think oftentimes three and Apple
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.520]   and developers.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.840]   There's going to be a little bit of bad news for people who have had old apps and haven't
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:13.680]   really updated them we'll talk about iOS 11 later on but it's relevant to say that there's
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.560]   might be a little bit of a cleanup to the app store because iOS 11 is not going to be
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.200]   32-bit app compatible so any older apps that have been updated obviously we're talking
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.120]   about old apps that haven't been updated in a while won't be able to work on this new
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.280]   version of the operating system and you might think that okay so what the the aforementioned
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.080]   Fart flashlight app that has that someone did as a programming project when they're taking
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:41.160]   their first class in 2008 no longer works but that might also mean a really important
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.480]   companion app for a piece of hardware that works just fine and the person who uses it
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.920]   still wants to use it or a piece of a piece of custom hardware that works off of an iOS
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.760]   device like in a hospital or in a machine shop that once again a contractor wrote this for
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.960]   them three or four years ago and now they're going to have to hire somebody to build a
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.400]   64-bit version of that app that might be a bit of a bummer we're going to have to see
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:09.200]   exactly how that works but let's move on to of course the most famous thing from the keynote
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.520]   of course is the HomePod they Apple ended with it I thought that we'd start with it
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.800]   because I don't think anybody wants the keynote to end with the most exciting and interesting
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:24.200]   thing so the HomePod is what the coneheads used to refer to as their house but it's also
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:31.000]   their intelligent smart awesome speaker we were all anticipating something like a Siri speaker
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.880]   like Google Home or like the Amazon Echo but this what they gave us is they're really really
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:43.000]   hammering home the point that this is a redefining home audio this is a totally new home audio
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.480]   component oh my god the home audio so it has a custom really huge custom woofer that has been
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.520]   designed by Apple it's got seven tweeters all around it and the and also an A8 processor
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:00.360]   which is the same CPU that's in the Apple TV and older phones so there's a lot a lot of processing
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.960]   power in it and it's not being used necessarily for Siri according to the demo that they gave
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:12.360]   the big upshot of this is that it will I assume using the tweeters as a form of sonar with all
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.200]   the array of microphones to figure out where the speaker is in the room figure out okay I'm actually
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.840]   at the back of a room next to a wall and there are two walls equidistant from my left am I right
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:27.800]   great so I'm going to shape the sound so that it doesn't matter that I've been placed in an
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.920]   not somewhat somewhat awkward location and there was also a long bit where they're trying to explain
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:39.000]   that not only that but the CPU is actually also going to kind of it's not as though it's going to
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.480]   tear apart the audio that you're playing and sort of remix it it will find out okay here's the vocalist
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.560]   we will put the vocalist here and because there's it's a big ceiling we're going to have to really
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:55.160]   boost the vocal track here here are the drums here's some really deep bass we're going to have to
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:01.240]   mute that but also increase this the dimension of it the idea being that you're spending 350
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.120]   dollars or roughly three times the cost of a of a google home but you're getting a really really
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:12.520]   really super awesome speaker and I wasn't thrilled about the price of it myself because once again
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.560]   the what I love about the my smart speakers is that it's not so I don't really buy it to have a
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:23.160]   really awesome home audio experience I buy it so that I'm in my bedroom and I can turn my lights off
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.360]   without getting out out of bed and then when I go downstairs to the kitchen I can listen to music
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.680]   while I'm washing the dishes and set a timer for something I would much rather have the three
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:38.040]   google homes or the three amazon echo or the two amazon echoes than the one really immense really
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.760]   wonderful speaker no matter how great it sounds um why don't you just buy a clapper
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:50.920]   I could borrow from my aunt she probably still has one um the the the other the other stuff to
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.040]   know is that uh it's uh it's not compatible with bluetooth is compatible with airplay too so
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.000]   it will technically work with any streaming service that you can stream off of uh your airplay
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.240]   compatible device but it will only directly access apple music without some sort of intermediary
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.760]   which is I suppose is necessary but I would love I would have loved to at least had bluetooth
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.800]   as an option I guess I'm not even gonna have like a headphone jack I can I can plug my tape
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:24.600]   player into uh so so kelly tell me why you know andy is is they don't put in his own
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.400]   headphone jack's anymore that's not a thing now correct it's really me I should I should be happy
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.840]   that the there are even speakers in this thing yes well I thought the speaker was really interesting
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:40.920]   but what I wanted from apple and I don't know if I'm alone in this but what I wanted from apple
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:48.520]   was a series speaker the way I can have an amazon speaker or a google speaker which is to say the
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:55.640]   point of it is not that it's a speaker like I don't feel like apple's going up against the echo unit
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.360]   or the google home unit with this with this device I feel like they're going up against stuff like
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:06.440]   sonos and I think there's a bow system that works kind of the same way but I think they're going
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.960]   up against those sorts of things I don't think they're going up there it doesn't seem like they're
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.000]   gunning for the assistant because it's like they built this amazing speaker that happens to have
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.680]   Siri it was like Siri was almost the afterthought when they when they talked about it they were like
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   look at all this amazing stuff and Siri will answer you but look at all these stuff and done
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:33.080]   did they um did they announce anything about home kit being available with or working with this
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.720]   speaker yeah they did they didn't announce some uh some updates to home kit like including wireless
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:42.600]   speakers into into airplay too is part of home kit part of air play to is support for wireless
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.560]   speakers so perhaps you could have they didn't mention anything about the sonos compatibility
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:53.400]   but there's still a lot that can happen between now and September but so in theory perhaps you
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.840]   could have Siri working across because home kit is all tied up into the same into the same rice
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:04.200]   crispy street so maybe maybe one of the things that is hidden inside the speaker is like the
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:13.720]   being the hub for the home kit stuff talking being able to talk to home kit devices
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:21.640]   I think the a that the built-in processors maybe an indication of that so that it's
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:29.320]   like a mesh network of you can put a speaker in every room and then the speaker will talk to
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:36.280]   the home kit devices that you have I don't know if they if it works that way but I would I would
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:44.280]   assume that that is sort of like the idea my problem was it was I have awesome speakers
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.920]   I already have awesome speakers there's these two guys bowers and wilkins and they make fantastic
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.600]   speakers and I have a bunch of them in my house and we spent a lot of time and a lot of research
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.800]   and we set them up and they're amazing and I have a receiver on the two levels where I have
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.560]   serious speakers I have a receiver that does airplay and so I airplay to those speakers when I want
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:09.640]   to hear stuff out of those speakers so having the I see the chain he really really agrees with you
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:16.360]   just whoo having the awesome speakers wasn't wasn't the part of that I wanted like because we
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:22.200]   had this conversation in my house like a year ago now hey that's by has the amazon unit on sale
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.960]   the echo unit and then uh mr kelly said okay so when is apple gonna come out with one of these
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.600]   and I said I don't know if they're ever going to and the rumors that we're hearing don't really
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:38.680]   say anything that would lead me to believe that and then he said okay I guess we'll get one and see if
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.800]   we like it because they still have like a 30-day return policy at Best Buy so he brought it home
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.680]   and it's still here and I have no interest in the new one he has no interest in the new one because
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:54.200]   we already have great sound systems set up wherever we wanted a great sound system so for
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.560]   people who are maybe getting into this there may be a market for it but I don't see it
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:03.560]   well part of me that the bothered me about watching the keynote was you saw all this amazing
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.280]   stuff where he's talking about like AR and updates to metal and talking about all this futuristic
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.640]   awesome stuff and then at the end he's like we've saved our most important announcement and we're
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:16.280]   talking about apple music and it was just like oh god Tim quit trying to make apple music happen
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:23.080]   it's not fetch it's not good I'm just I'm so sick of every single keynote every year ending you know
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.600]   like after we see all of this amazing awesome stuff it's like okay we're gonna end on our most
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:34.120]   important announcement and it's apple music it's just like great at least it wasn't carpool car okay
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:42.520]   okay that was entertaining in a lightweight I'll give it that I'm a very big fan of that show I
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:48.120]   will not yeah well that's not stand by what bad stuff was said about that show it's it's it's
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:56.040]   it's a weird one that's that's what that's all that listen I'm Oliver you listen to the Adele
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.840]   car and if your eyes are dry at the end of that I know your robot you got a heart you got a lump
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.240]   of steel your heart should be that's what I'm talking about is Adele and carpool karaoke I want
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.800]   that playing 24 hours a day inside my coffin after I die maybe even before I die I'll get the coffin
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:15.320]   if the coffin includes Adele singing carpool karaoke but it's it's it's initially the thing
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.800]   the last thing that reminded me though is that I am now currently I'm currently in the process
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.440]   of trying to upgrade the audio in my just in my office because I want I've been listening to a
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:31.240]   lot of opera and there is now what I call the Danadamrao test Danadamrao is like my really really
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:36.840]   amazing soprano and I will think that a set of speakers is oh my god these are great these
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.920]   are totally worth the three hundred dollars I spent for them now let's let's play the mad scene from
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:48.520]   Lucia de lama more and you can hear you hear the speaker saying I'd like to go back to Best Buy
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:56.040]   now please you know or play some more rush play some rushes ease don't play that that the Adele
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.920]   dabrao again because it makes me feel inadequate so that's that's the difficulty of selling this
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.520]   three hundred fifty dollar speaker where I'm sure that by the time they ship it they're going to
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.160]   make a big bigger point by here is all the things we've added to Siri in order to make this more
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.480]   useful as an active speaker right now they're just saying you're spending 350 dollars on them one
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:19.720]   the most incredible developments in home audio technology since the invention of quadriphonic sound
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.520]   and it goes back to the store the first time to play something that doesn't work I find it
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:30.600]   interesting that Apple is trying to kind of put it on a note and knock yeah sorry jenny
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   well I just I think it's interesting that Apple is kind of putting this those forward right now
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.240]   as you know like the the pioneer of really high quality sound because I was an actually an
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.400]   audio engineering student back when the iPod originally came out and you know they were talking
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:48.760]   about how you could have a thousand mp3s that were really crappy and you know lostly lostly and
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.680]   horrible that you could listen to on your your cruddy little like you know earbuds and like
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.240]   this was a huge innovation was yeah the sound was crappy but you could have a lot of it so I find
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.440]   it kind of ironic that Apple is now like here we're going to sell the three hundred dollar headphones
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:07.880]   and the three hundred fifty dollar speaker we are now the you know the the leaders of you know
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:12.920]   high quality audio for the home after you know they kind of destroyed it back in 2005
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:19.720]   Alfred do you have something to say before we go to commercial
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:28.120]   I just just for the home pod I just looked at the at the website at the Apple website and it
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:37.240]   it has a section right at the end about Siri and being this great assistant in the home and being
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.520]   able to turn off the lights and stuff like that so home kid is definitely part of a story here and
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   maybe they focus on the sound because it's easier to sell yeah so that's the one thing they could
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:54.440]   definitely show off I'm I'm really not supposed to show people this but I actually have a home pod
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:01.240]   that's on loan but it is actually just the bottom from my my Google home so I
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:07.320]   that's just a big old lie in my part I'm sorry I just I want to feel like a big shot Renee
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:15.640]   Renee wrote about the home pod from his he got the course here at the demo you demo area and
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:21.080]   I actually had a backtrack and console he's saying in this he's buying at least four for his home
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.440]   that's like okay that's that's that's that is and that is the immediate reaction of someone who's
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:32.440]   actually heard it and if they if they came with different bands I would say that no it's because
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.440]   of different launch bands but no he must have been very very impressed I was gonna say this is
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:44.040]   gonna put a this may possibly put a dent in his watch band purchasing so wow that's that's a serious
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.160]   statement for him to make as a fan of his of his Instagram I'm looking forward to him having to
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.840]   like carry now both of his two color different different home pods along with every single
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.480]   iPad and every single iPhone every single watch he has we can do those really great photos of every
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:06.200]   single copy of something in matching colors on a concrete cinder block next to it next to a stream
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:13.480]   we we can talk to we can talk to about that next week until then let's let's hear from Leo who
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:20.040]   has some honest honest words from a reliable advertiser to share with us hi hello everybody

[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:44.040]   site lio Laporte.com getting it all ready because I one of the great things about having a site
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:50.040]   of your own on the net is putting pictures up there and knowing you know they're gonna be there
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.600]   wordpress makes it really easy to create a website for your personal life for your blog

[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:27.000]   blog in the early well I guess the early 2000s so I've been doing it a long time and it's it I
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.680]   have to say it gets better and better but one of the reasons I like wordpress.com even more than
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.000]   hosting my own wordpress blog which I did for a long time is they keep it up to date they keep
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.640]   it maintained they've got great what do they call them happiness engineers that if you have a problem

[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.320]   working on it and that's the other thing that's great about wordpress is you could always tweak it
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:24.840]   the other thing I love about wordpress.com is the community that's around it so I was blown away

[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:34.760]   CDs of pan flute music while you are there boy if there if there was it when you look back at the
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.840]   yesterday's keynote one of the threads that went through pretty much everything was graphics graphics
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:44.760]   graphics graphics and probably the most newsworthy part of that was they're pushed into augmented
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:51.480]   reality and I was really impressed with their choice of how to pursue it whereas Google is saying
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.640]   hey we've got this phone called project tango and it's got special extra sensors and cameras so
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:00.440]   that it can map a room and see where you're going and Microsoft is saying we've got this great thing
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:06.760]   called hollow lens that you can wear this not even like Geordi LaForge beta thing on your head
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.720]   and as you look around the room it will place things in front of you and apple this is the
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.600]   this is like the least appleish thing I could imagine them doing they're they're seem to be saying
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:23.640]   we don't want you to have to buy anything go use your iPhone use your iPad and do augment and
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:28.280]   we're gonna let developers developers all the tools they need to do awesome virtual
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:34.920]   augmented reality and we're happy to let them find the awesome in in in augmented reality they
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:41.160]   have a new system called ARKit and it's really across the board everything that revolves graphics
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:48.760]   has been revamped up they have metal to now the the graphics coded right to the metal I think the
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:54.360]   advertising tag phrase was and Janie what is really important about metal to have you been
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.240]   had a chance to dig into the developer docs on it I don't think they've updated the developer docs
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   yet I went on to the documentation and like they have betas for all of the like ARKit and MLKit
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:11.080]   but when I go to the metal stuff it's still copyrighted back to 2016 and so like sometime
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.560]   after we get done talking here they're going to have the the metal to presentation but I haven't
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:21.640]   had a chance to look through it yet but like for me so I when I saw metal originally announced back
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:26.280]   in 2014 I was like yes this is the thing that I'm going to do this is gonna be the thing I'm gonna
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.640]   you know make my mark on everything's gonna be awesome and then like life got in the way and I
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.320]   wound up doing a bunch of stuff with Swift and I kind of thought that I'd missed the boat on being
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:39.240]   able to put my mark on metal so back in October when Pearson came to me and talked to me about
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.560]   wanting to do this metal book I was really excited about it because nobody had done a book on metal
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.600]   yet I mean Warren more did but then he went to work for Apple and that so that doesn't count but
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:55.720]   like I just I had some worries going into WWDC that like metal you know it was gonna be it was an
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:00.280]   older technology I didn't think anybody was gonna be really excited about it I knew that Apple had
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.240]   been kind of trying to push it for a couple of years but I figured that it was just gonna be
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.160]   something that was gonna be kind of you know like behind the scenes that nobody was ever
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.320]   actually gonna go in and like program to the metal and that it was more of a like you know
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:16.040]   something that people at Unity or Unreal or people at Apple would do but not what normal people would
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:22.520]   do so when I saw that they had like most of the keynote dedicated to graphics and that they had
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:27.160]   updated metal to metal too and that they had all of this stuff about machine learning and all of
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:33.400]   these things that went back to the GPU and went back to metal I was so happy and relieved that they
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:37.880]   were really making an investment in this technology and that I wasn't gonna you know put out this
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.560]   book in a couple of months of paper it's gonna be like okay whatever we're just gonna buy it so
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:47.080]   we can put it on our shelf and make it look cool like this is an ongoing evolving technology that
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:51.400]   they are invested in and it really makes me excited about being an Apple developer.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:56.600]   Yeah it seems like they got two really interesting parts of the new version of metal one of which
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:03.240]   is metal for VR so they can you can introduce the VR pipeline to that and also and this wasn't
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:10.360]   this is nearly the one the first gasp in the entire keynote support for external GPUs so during the
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:17.800]   demo in the demo area for instance they had a like a I think was a was it a Verve or was it the
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:23.480]   HD yeah I think was in yeah I'll just quote out my nose but they had one connected to like an
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:28.280]   external GPU with a frame frame rates that were insane and an immersive experience that was pretty
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:34.760]   pretty darn hot. Lack of support for external GPUs has been one of the big complaints about
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:40.200]   pro users who really need to be able to do real-time processing on all kinds of levels
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.080]   is that is that is that a problem that has now been solved Janaye Janaye?
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:52.200]   I don't think so like being able to connect like an external GPU but for me like I know that
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.520]   you asked me about the external GPUs and stuff but like I was a lot more but earlier you talked
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.760]   about AR and I'm actually a lot more excited about augmented reality than I am about virtual
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:08.280]   reality because I think that like can I talk about that of course okay so I was gonna say
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:13.080]   the next in the next bit but as long as we talked about how again I thought the GPUs was pretty
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:18.120]   interesting as to what they could mean for particularly the Mac in the future but yeah the
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:22.440]   AR kit looks pretty darn hot. Well I was just gonna say one of the things that worries me about
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:28.760]   the external GPU stuff is like I have one of the retina 5k iMAX that came out a couple of years
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:34.520]   ago and the driver for the for it has a weird GPU in it because I really maxed out the computer
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:40.600]   and my updating to Sierra like completely broke the GPU and the ability for it to be able to play
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.240]   video like I had it yesterday during the state of the union where my computer had like narcolepsy
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:49.720]   where every two minutes it would just like fall asleep because it couldn't handle like playing
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:55.640]   your video from WWDC and so for me like one of the worries that I have about the external GPU stuff
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.840]   is worrying that there's gonna be driver support for it over at Apple because like it's easier to do
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.680]   that with the like the iPhone and stuff like that because you know every single GPU that's gonna be
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.320]   in there because it's all integrated with Apple stuff but when you start bringing in external ones
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.720]   that people are buying from Nvidia and from other different companies you have a lot of support
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.080]   that you need to have for all of these various GPUs and I find that a little concerning.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:25.800]   Well it's it's it's a I think the interesting thing about AR right now is that nobody really knows
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.240]   what it is or they know that it's Pokemon Go and they know they can make a lot of money off of
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.880]   something that's a clue of Pokemon Go but I hope that ARKit is used for a lot more than just doing
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:39.160]   during the first wave is I'm sure gonna be clones of Pokemon Go when OS 11 comes out
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:44.760]   iOS 11 comes out but the list of things that it can do for you for developer just out of the box it
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.720]   has so it can detect a surface or a plane and so basically it'll figure out for you that here is a
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:55.800]   place where something can be put it can figure out the lighting of that scene so that as the lighting
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.840]   changes it can communicate how to change the lighting on the scene that you're placing on this thing
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:06.680]   it can figure out what the scale should be so that if you put a vase on the table it's not like a
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:12.200]   walk-in vase it's a it's probably about the right size for for vase or more like if you do if you're
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   doing like a 3d version of the cones of Dunshire game it will fit the table pretty much exactly
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:25.240]   and even goes into the camera app of excuse me the camera APIs for iOS 11 where if you've got
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.880]   the user is using a camera with two cameras on it now the depth information can be provided
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:37.400]   directly to the developer and like Kelly what was this does that inspire you in any way is that like
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.480]   I would never want I would never want to build this myself but now that I can just
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:47.320]   plug the leg stick legos together both virtually and in code form like does it give you any ideas
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:53.240]   part of it for me was it kind of gave some upgrade ability like one of the things a lot of people
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:58.680]   talk about that I talked to people who really do max out their hardware I freely admit I'm not
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:03.320]   one of those people but people who do run their hardware really hard they do a ton of video work
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:09.720]   or they do a ton of audio processing and things like that for those folks the GPU stuff is going
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:16.200]   to be huge because it could potentially mean that in two or three years when your graphics card
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.720]   starts to feel a little creaky that you can get this new little box and stick next to it and then
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:26.040]   maybe you can get another year out of it and it's a better investment than having to try to buy a
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:32.760]   whole new machine at that point or whatever so for me it sort of felt like one of the upgrade
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.520]   concerns that a lot of people have had or one of the complaints a lot of people have had about
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:41.720]   Apple hardware which is the graphics card is they're taking steps to resolve and it's one of those
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:49.400]   things that I feel like much like last year we got the non apple display that was 5k that you could
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:55.000]   hook to your computer that apple didn't make I feel like this is again apple sort of
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.960]   copying to the fact that like we know graphics cards are in our jam and so we're going to give
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:05.880]   you the opportunity for it to be something else all over your boinks is especially
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:11.480]   involved in video and photo processing is there what what get excited you about metal and about
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:17.560]   all these new opportunities with graphics of course the machine learning stuff vision
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:28.280]   the machine vision things also of mental reality because we dabble in video creation tools and I
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   think it's it's an it's an amazing thing going forward to be able to give kids in schools a video
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:48.040]   app that they can use to create videos that adds augmented reality stuff so you can put in virtual
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   studios and and and and you don't have to build like expensive sets you can just
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:06.920]   you can just download them from the web and and just and put them into the app and and be
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:13.960]   a director and tell a story and and don't have to worry about the you know complex
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:23.640]   process of building a villain's castle or you know spaceship and and explosions and stuff like that
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:32.600]   and that can all happen in in augmented reality and and be added to your scene I think I think
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:45.880]   that's huge I also wasn't a big fan of VR until I saw the HD HD HDC YV and got to play with the
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:55.960]   Google Google drawing app in it and so I'm really looking forward to being able to to connect the
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:03.880]   the wife to my Mac and and play with with that creative app that is an amazing
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:13.480]   experience being able to draw in 3d space and walk around in your drawing and that that really
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:20.440]   got me hooked on on VR stuff I'm not so much a gamer which is the other big thing about VR
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:31.240]   but creation if you can be creative that's that's kind of my my thing so I you know the
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:37.000]   the graphics apple focusing so much on the graphics performance is sort of like the
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.320]   the realization that they they're not playing on the same
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:50.040]   level yet and that has to change is they want to be in the AR and VR game yeah
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:56.040]   yeah I hope this expands beyond gaming as well that's that's obviously the the demo of AR kit
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:03.080]   was Lego Batman and there's there was also some demos with some Lucas art not Lucas Arts but
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:09.400]   so some other gaming stuff but it's good to point out that they're also switching apple the entire
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:14.520]   Mac window manager I think over to metal two for better performance stuff like that when they're
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.760]   talking about the machine learning that was another again the machine learning drinking game every
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:24.120]   single thing like and when you dial the number it lights up the numbers we highlight the number
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.520]   of six using machine learning to know how much we should light it up to to signify it's okay that's
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:34.920]   great it really it's it's so they'd say they call it powerful machine learning made easy
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:41.320]   Google also at Google IO was talking about how they really want to take give give the machinery
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:46.120]   of machine yeah before we move on to machine learning is it okay if I make my point that I
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:53.000]   wanted to about AR absolutely I wanted to make a similar point to what Oliver was talking about
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.200]   like I've noticed in the years that I spent as an iOS developer that the most successful
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:04.280]   applications for the phone are ones that interact with something outside of the phone and within
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:09.720]   the outside world like I use I primarily use my phone for like Twitter and for maps and to check
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:15.160]   the weather and to do and to do these these short kind of ephemeral like interactions but they're
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.960]   always something that exists outside of the phone so like I was thinking before the keynote
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.680]   yesterday that the kind of the future of Apple was going to be more of along the lines of you know
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:30.200]   like the home kit bluetooth LE stuff that would interact with the phone but I think that AR has
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:35.160]   a lot of potential to it because I think that like there's a certain subset of people that kind of
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:39.400]   you know wanted to you know get the letter from Hogwarts telling them that they've been accepted
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:46.040]   to be wizard and the doctor to come and take them away to you know like far off lands and this idea
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:51.000]   that you can create an immersive experience on your phone where it takes you know this normal
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.160]   everyday world that you see around yourself and then transforms it into something that's
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:00.200]   completely different it's such a different experience than reading something in a book or
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.360]   watching a movie or even playing a video game it's something that's interactive and it's real and I
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:11.000]   think that there's so much potential in that space to create like immersive experiences and museums
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.160]   zoos and have educational experiences and there's I think there's so much potential there creatively
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:22.840]   to give us an ability to communicate with each other and give each other experiences on a level
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:26.920]   that we don't have right now so that really excited me about the potential about what we could
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:33.880]   do with that technology yeah it's huge there's there was a some photos from our travel site
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:38.920]   I guess there's a there are a bunch of like relic sites where there's just like ruins of ancient
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:43.000]   buildings and you just see like the cornice and like part of the foundations but they put up like
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.120]   a sheet of like plexiglass that if you stand at the right place it will show you what the
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:53.000]   what the contours of the actual building were like mapped against what is actually still there
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.640]   and that's the sort of stuff that really gets me excited about AR the ability to take out my phone
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.800]   and just hold it up and now see this is what this this is what this building was like before the
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:07.560]   British came in 1781 and and decided that it shouldn't be there anymore at this part of this
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:13.240]   place in America thank you very much so yeah there's there's just so if it's if it's just another
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:19.640]   wave of Pokemon go clones if they're good Pokemon go clones but the the the ability to tap into the
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:25.480]   imagination of everybody with AR and also with machine learning there there also they were really
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:34.680]   pushing the idea that their their new machine learning ML kit is all done on device so that
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:39.320]   you don't necessarily have to be doing transactions to a remote server or sending user data to a
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:45.800]   remote server to get access to the adventures of your machine learning code and I'm surprised to
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:51.160]   find that I was a little bit suspicious that okay you didn't mention the Mac in the in the demos
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:56.840]   of this but no it's every the code will work everywhere including on watches and I when you
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:02.200]   think about how machine learning can help you find out what time it is that's pretty good too
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:09.160]   I was really excited when they started to really push the on device machine learning stuff because
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.080]   like just I've been so frustrated for the last couple of years because we carry the super computers
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.480]   around in our pockets but then we're sending all of our data off to these servers because we want
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:21.800]   everything to be cross-platform we want to get the same data from the iOS users we're getting from
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.960]   the Windows phone users and the Blackberry users and the Android users and it's like no
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:31.480]   there's so much potential for what you can do on this device you can have it do all of this processing
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:36.360]   and this is like magical and people are like oh yeah you know might be magical but you know not
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:44.440]   you know it's not available on Android so it's it's things to be not iOS
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.640]   actually we haven't we haven't talked about let's a little bit of hardware yet let's let's talk about
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:56.600]   watch OS I was I wasn't disappointed with what they said but I was expecting a little bit more but
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:02.440]   nonetheless if they really did get super super excited and more I find about how good of a fitness
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:10.280]   device it is and I will Janie and Kelly seem to be the most fit people on this panel perhaps one of
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:15.800]   you should jump in for Oliver and I speak about this
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:25.320]   this is this is so horribly embarrassing but like I worked out of my house and so basically like I
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:31.240]   don't I don't have to go anywhere my my room is like 10 steps away from my office and so like when
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:36.680]   I first got the watch I think it had like my calorie goal like 350 calories a day and it kept getting
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.320]   lower and lower and lower because I just never had to leave my house for any reason and now I think
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:47.400]   it's like 150 or something like that and so like it's just like uh this is not working the way that
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:51.240]   it's intended to do as a fitness device because I never have to leave my house this isn't intended
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:55.400]   for hermits this is for people that live in like you know New York City and like walk everywhere
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:04.200]   well I don't either I work for my house too but um so my commute to flight of stairs but um because
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:10.120]   of that I started using zombies run and I started using because I have an elliptical machine and so
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:17.880]   I've been using zombies run and tracking the workout on my watch in order to um you know check out the
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:23.720]   calorie goals and see if I was making it and so far it's been super useful and that was one of the
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:29.000]   things that sort of surprised me was as I started digging into that I was mostly just relying on the
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.680]   stand reminders uh to make sure that I pulled my head out of my laptop once in a while but for the
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:39.960]   most part like that wasn't like that was the bulk of the fitness stuff that I was doing and so now
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:45.160]   I've started looking at other stuff like I can operate the zombies run app from my watch I'm not
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:51.080]   even a big zombies as a concept fan but this app has been really good and it gets me you creatures
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.720]   with brains every day to spend time on the treadmill this is true
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:01.960]   I've been into it and it's gotten me motivated and part of that is I get to use the the nerdery
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:07.560]   piece of having it on my watch and having my watch truck my workout and the activity sharing
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:12.520]   which is something I've just sort of started getting into is being able to like cheer on and
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:17.960]   also smack talk uh other friends of mine when their workouts pop up for me and like when my
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:23.160]   workouts pop up for them so that's been actually a lot of fun and that's only been like the last
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:28.200]   month and a half maybe that I've been into that. Jamie the Nolver please.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.760]   Okay so um so with the watch one of the things that they mentioned yesterday during the keynote
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:36.360]   was they said like like if you're driving they were going to lock your phone so that it wouldn't
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.240]   give you like push notifications and I want to know I think I'm gonna do the same thing with the
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:43.160]   watch because I noticed the first year that I had the watch like I would be driving along and I get
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.840]   like a notification on my wrist saying it's something who's on twitter it's like oh I wonder what
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:53.400]   I was trying to move on the side of the road and like I had to train myself not to look not to look
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:57.000]   at my watch whenever it would be paying and I'm like that's that would totally be like a safety
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   feature that I think that they should do for not only for the phone but for the watch because you
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.080]   know if you're driving and something bad you're you're gonna try to look at it and your hand is on
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:11.400]   the wheel. You start off with I just hope that it won't say hey you've been sitting in this car
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:16.760]   and driving for 45 minutes why don't you get out on this highway at 70 miles an hour and take a walk
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.520]   after tucking and rolling for the first 50 yards of course.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.520]   Yeah how does that show up in the activity app?
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:33.000]   Yeah the watch is always saying like the you know the 10 minutes to the to the hour
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.320]   warning whether you get up it's always saying that if when I'm driving so it's like I get this
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:45.160]   notification while I'm driving so yeah there are a bunch of let's go ahead.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:52.440]   The other thing I wanted to say was that when the Pokemon Gold stuff first really hit off
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:55:00.200]   the discussion over here was sort of like you know one good thing is that it gets the kids out to
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:08.600]   walk around so a lot of people were just so this is where augmented reality marries the fitness
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:14.760]   would track a business. It's like it's like carrot cake they trick me into eating a vegetable
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:19.640]   but that's okay. So I'm gonna eat the vegetable but there are a bunch of really nice little
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:25.240]   features in it. There's the new Siri watch face they call it the intelligent proactive assistant
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:30.760]   which is to me seemed a way of saying yeah we looked at Android where from a couple years ago
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.520]   and they seem to have a good idea there where we'll just show you things that it kind of figures
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:41.240]   out that you would that would be handy at that moment. A new kaleidoscope watch face. All right I
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:46.040]   was hoping that was not on my predictions list but glad you gave it to me. Another happy moment
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:52.360]   was now in addition to Mickey and Minnie Mouse now you get from Toy Story you get Buzz, Woody and
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:59.560]   Jesse and little cartoons when it wakes up of the little story vignettes. That's cool but I was
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.360]   still surprised that the watch has been out for this long and developers still cannot create
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:08.840]   custom watch faces. This could be the most artistic cool additions you can make to it.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:19.000]   That was the point is I wonder what the reasoning is behind that because it has to be some
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:27.720]   real good reason. Otherwise they wouldn't let go of the chance to make millions on the
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:37.400]   upsto or from Apple board faces. I would buy them. I would buy watch faces. If I could get one that
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:42.360]   was functional in some way I would gladly pay a buck or two depending what it was if it was
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:49.320]   my favorite band or Star Wars or Doctor Who or you know hi like if it's some sort of nerd thing
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.560]   and you put it on the App Store for 99 cents for me it's probably a pretty easy sell. So I would
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:57:02.600]   love to have the Millennium Falcon. Somebody yesterday posted a picture of BB-8. BB-8's head on top
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:07.800]   of the activity rings and the activity rings were orange and white and I went yes I will buy that
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:13.560]   and it's not a thing and I'm disappointed because those are the kind of things that would be
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:20.440]   awesome like you know maybe a baseball in in all the Major League Baseball's colors or a basketball
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:27.880]   for blazer fans like me you like I would buy those. So I don't understand why not either because
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.640]   you can still give it the limited functionality like in the old days when we used to get games
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:36.920]   for the iPods. Like there wasn't a ton that you could do because you only had one interface
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:42.680]   mechanism and it was the little scroll wheel. So why can't we have the same sort of like here
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:48.200]   what the limitations are know that going in and yet at the same time go crazy. Like I think that
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.360]   would be a really smart approach and that was actually something I was hoping for yesterday was
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:57.720]   more customization not just extra watch faces while those are awesome and I'm probably going to install
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:02.200]   all of them the minute that I feel like the betas haven't started breaking stuff for people.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.920]   I'm totally in but in the meantime like that was the thing that I was sort of hoping for that
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:13.720]   did not happen. Speaking of things that we might have been hoping would happen but did not happen
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:18.840]   they gave TVOS one of the whole they said this is going to be we're going to be talking about
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:24.600]   six things today and I think the TVOS was number one or number two and it was now
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:32.280]   Amazon video is coming to Apple TV and also number two. Okay well that's nice but you didn't
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:38.520]   see a whole lot it's not as though Apple TV is a you know unloved product but I guess I was hoping
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:45.160]   to see what are you going to be doing to make it awesome or in the fall. So I think I think what
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:52.920]   what's missing from the Apple TV story is interaction with the screen and and I you know of course they
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:57.240]   what's the let me refer one second to tell you what's missing from the Apple TV is my damn remote.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:02.520]   I lost it on Thursday. I have not found it since and I'm saying it's not as though I walk around
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:06.440]   with it in my house it's either on my bed or on the nightstand. I have now cleaned the entire
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:12.600]   bedroom no laundry left or trash left the room since okay I'm just I'm just venting I cannot
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:17.480]   believe that I cannot find my remote after five days I took I got up my old Roku three out of
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:23.080]   storage and replaced it okay but please continue I'm sorry I had it. So we need we need to find
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:30.920]   my Apple TV remote app. Yes well I think that a thing. There you go maybe we can use machine learning
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:37.160]   to say okay Andy no knowing you having watched you for the past year is it possible that you're
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.760]   you're looking for something and then you realize that you left your headphones the other room so
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:46.920]   without knowing it you carry it into like the living room. You know we have like there's this
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:56.600]   really interesting technology for tracking consumers while listening to you know sounds that make
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:02.760]   you know that apps make and you could conceivably make an app with the
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:10.280]   home pod that would emit some sound and use the microphone on the remote
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:19.560]   to actually locate where the remote is. And that's how they're going to sell all the home pods.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:24.840]   This will help you find your Apple TV remote. You tell it to play the sound and then the remote
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:30.360]   will ping from them underneath the couch and there you go a $350 remote finder.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.840]   Well Apple also introduce a whole bunch of new hardware including stuff that I will not be
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.920]   able to afford for at least another year we will talk about that after this from our friend Leo
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:46.760]   Laport. I'm sorry data erupt but thank you for this moment to tell you a little bit about texture.com
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:54.280]   before I left on vacation I loaded up my iPad I got it right here with great magazines from texture
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:01:00.440]   texture is like Netflix for magazines. Oh look just got this notification new issues of the Hollywood
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:08.040]   reporter have been downloaded and sports illustrated have been downloaded. These are all the favorites
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:13.240]   I have on texture and so texture you pay one flat rate 10 bucks a month you get more than 200
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:18.760]   the best magazines in the world. I subscribe to so I call it subscribing but it's a lot less
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.440]   expensive than a subscription right. I have favored it and automatically download consumer reports
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.120]   well I love you know seeing beautiful homes. Mother Jones because I love following left wing
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:35.800]   politics people because I love gossip. What are what are what are what are what are Kate and Pippa
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.040]   up to I got to know Rolling Stone now I don't read a cover to cover and this is the neat thing
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.840]   about texture. There's usually one interesting article or two maybe in Rolling Stone that I want
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:50.040]   to read but which so for that I wouldn't buy the newsstand issue where maybe I used to or
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.400]   subscribe I did do that also but I was feel guilty about the pile of paper and the clutter on my
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:03.160]   coffee table. So this way I get that one article and then and I don't feel bad. Severe and self
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.440]   because I like food and health. Actually I think self is Lisa's oh that's another nice thing.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.680]   Lisa you can have five different devices on one texture subscription so Lisa and I share our
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.320]   subscription. So some of these might be her shutter bug because I'm a photography bug which so is she
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:22.280]   sat in vision because I'm an audio file sports illustrated. That's Lisa she's big into the NFL.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:28.280]   The Atlantic great stuff being written the Atlantic David from I love him. Hollywood reporter because
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:34.280]   that's you know I like to pretend I'm in the show business. The New Yorker of course travel and leisure
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.440]   I I used to subscribe to the North New Yorker. Texture is less than a subscription than New
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:47.000]   Yorker and I get all of this vanity fair wired popular science PC magazine. Texture is 200 plus
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.720]   magazines for a lot less than you'd pay for just one. In fact right now it's really good because it's
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:03:00.760]   free for 14 days when you go to texture.com/twit. Apple's top 2016 iPad app one of them anyway I mean
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.400]   really deserves it too. It is easy to read you get every page is in this new stand issue you get
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:10.120]   back issues you get bonus features like video there's curated sections I can go on and on but
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:18.760]   why not just try it it's free texture.com/twit. 14 days free and we thank texture for their
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:27.160]   support and Mac break weekly texture.com/twit. Now back to the show. Thank you Leo. Now Apple had
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:32.360]   to invite four or five hand picked journalists to the campus so that they could hat in hand
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:37.880]   explain yeah you know how we introduced that Mac Pro about being so awesome.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:44.360]   Maybe we screwed up on that one we're sorry about that and so they made a really really big
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:52.360]   attempt to adjust that one than WWD.C keynote by talking about brand new Pro Macs and upgrades to
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.360]   upgrades old ones. Now the ones that we're already familiar with the iMacs and the MacBook Pro's they
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.280]   all got the expected some generation KB like processors some upgrades to GPU some upgrades to
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:09.000]   disc speeds but obviously the centerpiece the centerpiece the whole thing was a brand new black
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.160]   were space gray black enough in my office after with my lighting you'll be black enough. The iMac
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:25.160]   Pro with up to with a 27 inch 5k display up to an eight up to 18 cores of xenon zon CPUs radion
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:33.720]   Vega graphics up to 11 teraflops the CPU process up to 22 teraflops 128 gigs of RAM now this was the
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:39.640]   one audible gasp for some reason in the audience that 120 gigabytes of RAM they I think even the
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.720]   speaker was kind of hit back by that as well as for think four terabytes of internal graphics
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:51.320]   also they I think they made it when they showed you the cutaway they also made a big point of saying
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:57.320]   we decided that maybe fans are a good idea like having some fans some sort of a active cooling
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:01.800]   system so that I don't know three years later we'd have to apologize to people because we couldn't
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.000]   put more process more powerful processors because our passive cooling system could not handle it
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.840]   five grand in its base configurations going to be available in December this was a preview
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:19.320]   and the kids seem to like it I was on Facebook a good friend of mine is a colorist for DC comics
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:26.360]   which means that she does nothing but essentially rig light and color every single page of every
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:31.320]   single of all the comics that she does and she said I asked her ask for her permission to use
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:39.880]   this quote why does the word teraflops make me so tingly so this is so this is definitely very
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:48.840]   much upper alley I'm I'm this did seem like a new wave of respect for the Mac Oliver like
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:55.640]   given that what's who's buying one I'm gonna say I'm gonna put it to you first because
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:01.080]   you have you have probably the biggest excuse to buy one given what your company makes
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.320]   and can you buy two and hire me as a consultant and let me borrow it for a year
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.440]   yeah let's talk about that uh of
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:18.600]   Andy stole my idea of course we're gonna have of course we're gonna we're gonna get one
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:26.120]   or maybe one more and I'm looking forward to see how well it actually performs so
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:36.520]   recently I did a live stream in Berlin and the room was very hot so I used a new
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:41.480]   one of the newer Mac Pro's and it has this
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:51.080]   logic built in that you know reduces the processor power if some if it's in danger of
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:58.120]   overheating or something like that and if you do a live stream that happens quite fast so
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:05.720]   after about 10 minutes or so suddenly the Mac Pro doesn't have 3.4 gigahertz anymore it just
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.520]   tunes down the processor to 1 gigahertz and then that kind of made me a little bit
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:23.240]   that experience made me a little bit cautious about you know small you know thin pro machine so
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:31.080]   they have Apple acknowledging on the stage that there is a cooling issue and they have
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:37.400]   and they claim they have solved it with iMac Pro I'm a little bit cautious about that
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:47.320]   other than that the machine specs really really sound exciting I mean it's the dark gray itself
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.360]   it's gonna it's gonna be giving you 20% more performance
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:58.440]   yes because because of course it's absorbing light and therefore getting more energy from
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.840]   the solar flares and such I suppose although I can't imagine it being much more powerful than this
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:10.040]   they kept underscoring about how this is going to be great for like VR content creation all these
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:14.840]   GPUs is going to be great for machine learning most of machine learning development is being done
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:20.440]   on GPUs these days so I don't I don't think this is going to be this will probably a little bit
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:26.360]   overkill for like watching Hulu but it will probably do a great job watching Hulu especially
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:35.400]   the 4K stuff is and of course I can't of course I can't drop 5 grand on on this my car is not
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:41.880]   worth 5 grand but is this is this and that's and that's the entry level of configuration I mean
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:48.280]   who wants that yeah you know you want to thank you course and I think if you I think it goes for
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:55.160]   that say we can can safely assume that you can multiply the you know what's the base configuration
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:09:03.880]   6 4 so 18 course is going to be three times that much and then you don't want 128 you know you want
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:11.960]   the three terabytes is it good is it good is it good to look thank you way past 20 grand so it's
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:19.480]   like yeah it's gonna be like buying a BMW where it's like oh you got a BMW oh you got the 320 model okay
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:28.760]   hey it's still a BMW I you know I'm different I needed the m5 but hey good good for you
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:36.200]   it's good that you mentioned that because I think Apple really borrows from the German car makers
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:43.320]   where you know you buy and you buy a BMW and it comes without the steering wheel you have to buy
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:47.080]   a steering wheel extra so that's a different trim package yeah
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:57.560]   no we're taking that to the Nurburgring but is this so overall like I won't I won't speak for
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:03.160]   anybody else I've been not worried necessarily about the Mac but I've been very very much looking
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:10.600]   for a sign that Apple loves the Mac as much as Mac users love them is is this a really good sign
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:15.960]   that look how much we're investing in this or is Apple the snarky comment that came to mind as I
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.920]   was taking notes through the keynote was Apple's message seems to be we love the Mac we think it's a
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:27.320]   great machine for building iOS apps on so we're giving you the greatest iOS app development machine
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:36.600]   ever it'll compile your iOS app so fast fast so have you checked out the number of Macs they sell
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:42.520]   and then they claim like 16 million app developers everyone needs a Mac or whatever one of those
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:48.760]   machine people needs a Mac and some have two so I think that makes for a pretty big chunk of all
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:58.920]   the Macs sold and of course you know one of the interesting things was that they at the same time
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:09.320]   they really stepped up the iPad iOS game with with some of the key features that were missing
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:18.040]   previously with the iOS drag and drop support which actually said you can now use multiple apps to
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:24.600]   work together on one project and that's kind of what's been missing from the iPad to make it
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:35.000]   a viable replacement for you know so at the same time they've really risen our hopes
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.960]   for the Mac they also introduced the ultimate Mac killer
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:49.800]   Jenny what do you think so um like I've had Apple computers basically my entire life we bought an
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:55.720]   Apple 2e back in 1985 and I remember back in 93 or whatever that everybody kept making fun of me
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.040]   because I had an Apple computer and I didn't have a Windows computer and my dad told me well Apple
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.760]   computers are so much better than other computers because they made Jurassic Park on those computers
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:10.520]   and like I went to school for audio engineering and video editing and so like we had you know
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.760]   Macs for all of this content creation like Pro Tools originally was on the Mac and eventually
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:22.280]   got ported over to Windows and until maybe like 2006-2007 like if you wanted to do really high
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:27.160]   quality content creation you bought an Apple computer but over the last 10 years they just
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.720]   haven't been keeping up with all that stuff you know they introduced Final Cut X instead of you
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.680]   know it'll cut 8 and it really cut down on all of the pro stuff and I know that a lot of people in
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.080]   the gaming industry that I talked to have been complaining for years that they can't really do
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:49.320]   high level game development on a Mac like I have I like said I maxed out the 5k Retina iMac a couple
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:56.360]   of years ago and anytime I turn on like Maya or I turn on Unreal or I turn on Unity like the
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:02.520]   computer it just slows to a crawl and it's impossible to actually go in and do any high quality like
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.800]   work with that and I've been dreading the day that I have to break you know my 35 years streak of
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:13.240]   never owning a non-Apple computer to buy a crappy Windows computer that I have to build myself
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.960]   you know for parts that I salvaged from you know like various places on the internet like a
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:23.160]   savage you know back from the 70s and there are people who have never been doing for years and so
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.480]   I think that this was kind of like a response to the people complaining people have me complaining
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:32.680]   about them going like fine here here is your computer where you can make your fancy games and stuff
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:39.880]   you kids in your beep boops we used to make our computers out of twigs and animal skins
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.480]   teraflops it would flop and kill us that's how big and cumbersome they are
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:51.800]   silly kids these days how about you how about you Kelly are you keeping the faith
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.160]   yeah I think I think they were nice updates I didn't expect new design or
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.520]   you know anything like that I was glad to see that
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:07.320]   that everything sort of got refreshed all the all the laptops and all the desktops because we
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:14.280]   know there's a pro coming down the pipe at some point so I was glad to see that everything got
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:20.280]   what I feel like was in a pushable update it seems like it's it's been long enough and I liked
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:27.480]   that they got them um I felt like uh Oliver was exactly right like look at all the awesome stuff
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:32.360]   you could do with our new max and now let us show you why you don't want one because you can do
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:38.600]   all this other stuff on your iPad so I thought that was really interesting because it felt to me like
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:43.320]   that's again a thing that I don't know how much apple was doing of before which is listening to
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.080]   customers and lots of people have said these are the things that are keeping me from making an
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:53.400]   iPad my primary device and a lot of people are finding ways to work around that and even more so
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:59.320]   a lot of people have now just sort of found the way to forego whatever it is that's keeping them
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:05.720]   from using the iPad because they want so badly to have that be their main computer and now a lot
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.360]   of the complaints that people had are things that are being resolved with this new update and I'm
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:14.840]   pretty excited about that part yeah we're certainly getting new CPUs and that's great
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:18.840]   but I couldn't I couldn't just help I couldn't help but think that the energy level and the
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:25.080]   excitement level that apple conveyed during the iOS section of seconds of the keynote were so much
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:32.120]   greater than it's not as though they were they were dissing the Mac at all but they they told us
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:38.520]   that the name for the new version of Mac OS is Hi Sierra which is then they paused for 10 minutes
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:43.480]   so that everybody could tweet their own jokes about that name but it's as as a sequel to Sierra
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:48.120]   there is there usual now development update where it seems to be Sierra is the one where we're going
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.440]   to have really big huge improvements and then Hi Sierra will be the one where we just sort of
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.840]   make adjustments to that Craig Federighi was saying that specifically that this is the point
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.040]   of Hi Sierra is to quote provide a platform for future innovations and to show off how awesome
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:07.720]   the Mac is and Hi Sierra is he showed off it's got a web browser it's called Safari and it will
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:14.280]   they'll turn off audio that that audio adds that come out automatically mail now you can edit in
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:21.400]   split pains so you can have okay um really the only thing that was the only thing that was super
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:26.920]   seemed super cool was kind of like old news where the new apple file system which is they're
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:32.200]   finally getting rid of what they've had been basing the Mac file system on for what the past 20 years
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.840]   to something that's more modern that's more reliable that's a lot lot lot faster but it wasn't the
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:41.800]   sort of thing that gets people excited about being a Mac owner or gets them excited about
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:48.280]   gee if I had if I had two thousand dollars under my mattress to buy a Mac next year it didn't think
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:55.560]   well or I could spend eight hundred dollars of that on cookies and beer and have $1,200 to spend
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:01.960]   on my next windows laptop I'm not saying people should do that but I'm saying that yeah it's like
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:07.320]   it didn't seem like oh my god I'm so excited about what's coming up as as I was with what was
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:13.080]   coming up with with iOS and boy was there a lot to talk about they they really were trying as
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.920]   Oliver said they're really trying to say don't buy a Mac book for god's sake that would be silly
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:23.720]   when we have these new iPad pros which as was rumored there's the new 10.5 inch model that's roughly
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:30.440]   the same size as the probably gone now 9.7 inch one because they reduce the sizes of the of the
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:36.440]   bezels but they added better CPUs they've added better screens to both the both of the iPad Pro
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:42.600]   models the most to me one of the most exciting things is that they have now added sort of a
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:49.400]   variable they've doubled the screen refresh rate from 60 Hertz to 120 times per second which means
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:54.600]   that it will just everything will feel a lot smoother and a lot more liquid but it will also
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:18:00.360]   mean that when you're using for instance the Apple pencil it can sample a lot faster where
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.760]   where the pencil is going they didn't they did not announce any hardware changes in the Apple
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:12.120]   pencil but now the latency of the pencil has now dropped magically from 40 to 40 milliseconds to
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:17.640]   20 milliseconds which puts it little even a little bit faster than the Microsoft Surface
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:25.080]   pencil which was pretty much top dog in this in this place but it will also dip down the frame rate
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:29.880]   down to 24 frames per second if you're just looking at a photo there's no need to like lash
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:35.080]   out the battery if you're just looking at a picture so I'm really excited about what that
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.800]   experience is gonna look like and it goes on and on and on with features that they've added
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.440]   that a new application doc they've made they've actually finally given you drag and drop between
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:49.560]   panes they've given you something looks more like spaces so that if you have your pairs of apps
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:54.200]   like what I was taking notes in Omni-Outliner and tweet live tweeting and Twitter when I'm
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:58.360]   the reason when I'm writing a column it'll be scrivener in one pane and the google search app and the
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:02.600]   others now you can sort of save those as spaces and keep coming back to them but most of all it's
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:09.960]   just all about it really seems like give us a give us $700 to $1200 for an iPad and we will make
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:14.360]   you forget your allegiance to any other god or country because we're giving you such an awesome
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:19.320]   thing it's the it's the one thing that got me excited about spending money at Apple
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:26.440]   is it is anybody here all this open is anybody here like a really big iPad user I use this
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:33.480]   my it is my is my go-to field computer my macbook is like is tied down with chains and cables
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.560]   at my desk almost never take it out of the office now
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:42.600]   let's just do you think I think all right oh Janie that's just because the keyboard though right
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:49.880]   yeah I guarantee you that if you bought a new macbook anytime in the last year my keyboard on
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:55.800]   my macbook is way better than yours so that's actually I don't want to I don't want to retract
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:03.160]   but I have to say that $5,000 minimum for an iMac pro and you get this crappy sucks-a-ducks
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:09.480]   but keyboard that same super super super flat magic keyboard but it now has a numeric keypad
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:16.040]   I don't know anybody who wants a $5,000 $1,000 iMac who actually maybe maybe this is it maybe they
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:22.200]   realize that whatever keyboard we give a developer or content creator who spends $5,000 this will
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:27.880]   not be good enough we can just give them like a sticker representing here is where the the
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:32.680]   mac the keyboard would go and no one would notice it was just a sticker I'm sorry Janie I interrupted
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:41.480]   well I'm all ready to go okay Oliver please yeah I forgot what I wanted to say so
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:48.040]   I have that effect is anybody using iPads right now and then
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:56.280]   now I remember I remember so when the iPad first came out I was so super excited about it and
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:07.400]   so I threw away my macbook right away and got the iPad and about two minutes later I went out to the
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:15.160]   trash can and got the mac to throw back and I think I went through that three times or four times
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:25.000]   anytime you know iOS 9, iOS whatever 6, 7, 8, 9 every time I try to give it another shot and
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:36.120]   every time I found out that it didn't live up to what I needed to do and so I'm kind of like you
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:44.680]   know this time I'm waiting a little bit before I throw out my macbook and see what's going to
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:51.880]   happen and I think one of the biggest issues Apple faces in this thing is that the iPad apps are
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:22:01.160]   still not at the same quality level than the mac apps and I mean with a few exceptions maybe
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:10.120]   but even you know like infinity photo that doesn't have the depth of you know a Photoshop app or
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:19.480]   you know and so you always have those you might get like 70% of your drops done with the iPad app
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:28.360]   but there's also the 30% that make you go to your mac apps and and that's kind of where
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:34.360]   you know a real pro user doesn't want to switch tools too much I want a tool that
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:44.680]   you know basically covers all my needs and and and with the iPad apps a little bit behind I think
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:53.640]   the key issue is how do you make a business out of making great iPad apps and some some
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:58.120]   developers seem to be able to pull it off and I think if the guys who make infinity
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:07.480]   are probably one of those because they get heavily featured but there's not going to be a second
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:17.640]   photo editing app on the iPad that gets featured as much by Apple and so it's like you know you have
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:25.720]   to be incredibly lucky to to build a business out of that and I think that's one of the things
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:34.600]   they need to address and in the keynote interestingly they had some steps at the issue but they didn't
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:42.440]   really you know I haven't seen any solution for that so the one joke about the
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:51.480]   14 year old girl getting a hundred million dollar funding for her iPad app or iPhone app that's kind
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:24:00.360]   of like how I think it's kind of it's kind of interesting how they how they see the world you know
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:10.440]   so much money in the bank I think that's not the real world right you know Kelly the
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:17.880]   birthday they don't make money of it they are fed by their parents and they don't have to pay for
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:21.480]   rent and I'm just going to let Kelly handle this go ahead Kelly
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:28.040]   Well I mean that's part of it but you know one of the one of the other things about it about app
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:34.840]   camp specifically is that we're not trying to turn everyone into an iOS developer part of what we're
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:43.480]   trying to do is expose our developers to all the pieces that go into software development so even
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:48.520]   if you're a one person shop you still probably spend a little bit of time on marketing a little bit
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:53.800]   of time on testing a little bit of time on on getting the word out there about the app that you built
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:57.880]   so we try to expose them to all the pieces of that because there's a lot of stuff that goes into
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.600]   software that isn't necessarily hunching over a laptop and typing mystery stuff into Xcode or
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:08.920]   whatever so we try to show them more than that and sometimes people can get really interested in
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:15.560]   something like Andy's friend who does lighting and coloring for DC Comics like that's a whole
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:20.600]   profession and that's not necessarily a person that you think of or a career that you think of when
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:25.560]   you think about somebody who writes comic books uh you know the same way that you don't necessarily
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:30.440]   think about the person who breaks stuff all day long as an important piece of software
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:36.120]   production but that's totally a thing that needs to happen so um most of what we're trying to do
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:43.080]   is just expose people to that and I'm really excited to see what iOS 11 is doing primarily because
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:50.120]   I like the potential of this uh Riddle came out with their document suite a couple of months I want
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:56.600]   to say it's like a month ago or maybe two and in theirs you can drag and drop between their apps
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:02.280]   if you have both of them up in split screen and they found a way to do that within their own
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:09.160]   two applications before drag and drop was the thing on iOS 11 and so I'm really excited to see the
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:15.560]   potential of this now that there's a regular dock like you have on your laptop and there's an entire
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:20.120]   files app that will allow you to juggle things around and get at all that stuff that people have
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:26.520]   been complaining about on iOS for years I'm really excited to see where that's going to go and how
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.480]   other developers are going to use that that for me was one of the most interesting pieces because
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:37.160]   um I feel like and I say a lot that iOS is pretty mature there's not a lot that's that's going to
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:42.440]   be super wow out there that people are going to be able to uh look at because we've we've done a
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:46.680]   whole lot of you know wow on on the iOS side and it doesn't seem like there's
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.320]   necessarily a whole lot further to go until apple says yeah we should totally show you the
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.960]   file system and here you go it's all right here down the side of your screen and I was
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:01.800]   really excited to see that and I'm really excited to see like I said where that where people look at
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:06.520]   that and see the obvious connection of I'm going to totally be able to do this thing now that I've
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:12.120]   been trying to do on iOS for years and now they're going to be able to do it and I can't wait to see
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.720]   over the summer how those things evolve and how people are going to be able to make that happen
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:24.760]   and I and I think it's going to be a lot of fun I'm super pumped about it I want to be excited about
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:30.920]   I see era in the same way but I'm not because this is the bolt tightening release it's it's
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:37.480]   almost like Mac OS has gotten on the evolution revolution track just like the iPhones have so
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.800]   we you know we get the new release that's the revolution and then we get all the stuff that
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.560]   like tightens that down which is the evolution part like we're going to take all this stuff we gave
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.320]   you that was kind of weird and sort of clunky and we're going to refine it make it better in the
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:54.680]   next release and so I'm excited to see what we get in new hardware this summer that's going to be
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:59.480]   able to best utilize some of that stuff on the phone side I'm going to be really excited about
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:05.480]   that and speaking of person to person apple pay I think was one of the really exciting things that
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.080]   came out yesterday and I don't know Andy if that's on your list or not but it was one of the things
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:13.880]   that really stood out to me yep that's that's pretty cool if you have to you have to do it through
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:19.800]   iMessages so if someone at the table is using Android you can say oh I'm that's that's the modern
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:25.240]   oh I'm sorry I left my wallet at home oh I would so love to pick up half of this but I you have
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:32.840]   Android and I have so apparently so yes if really really easy using using touch ID as a matter of fact
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:40.280]   now there is a kind of a apple virtual digital debit card that your money gets paid into if you do
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:44.760]   this then of course you can transfer it back to your bank but yeah it makes it makes messages more
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:50.440]   relevant it makes that message is more interesting I like the I just like all the when I say that I
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.680]   use the iPad as a replacement for my notebook I don't necessarily mean it does everything the
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:29:00.360]   notebook would do I just mean that it does everything that I need my Mac to do when I'm out of the
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:07.000]   office where I'm not going to be writing an 80,000 90,000 word 150,000 word book project but I might
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:14.200]   like to write part of a chapter or edit an entire chapter I did I'm a sucker that this it the
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:19.800]   the demo of affinity photo did cost me 10 bucks because it looks so good the apple apple used
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:26.440]   this to show affinity show to photo to show how super super fast and super super credible as a
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:32.120]   thousand dollar computer the new iPad is and yeah when I'm home I would I would like to have a
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:36.120]   Photoshop but there are times where I'm on vacation or I'm out I'm traveling a business for two or
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.400]   three or four days and there is a couple of photos that I really want to process and if I had the
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:47.560]   ability to smart mask out the windows in the background and change the color temperature of
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:52.520]   those windows before I send this to my editor as part of my column I would definitely do that
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:58.680]   but I don't have that so I will just take what I can get but if I have a relatively expensive
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:03.960]   photo that lists me not just get things done but also gee I'm on I'm I'm on this bus for the next
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:10.120]   hour hey I happen to have I know that I happen to have like all 80 photos from the roller derby
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.760]   that I shot last week I think I'll just have some fun editing photos instead of you know reading a
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.880]   book or do anything like that so I like I really like everything they did especially the files app
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:25.320]   that you that you brought up it's a real big pain point in iOS when you're using an iPad on the
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:32.920]   field like how do I get a file that I can I have this fistful of electrons in my hand if I had if
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:37.960]   this were a windows machine or a MacBook or an Android device I could just open up a lid throw
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:42.280]   these electrons in and I would have the file visible to the device but this is an apple device
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:46.040]   and I'm not trying to get it from an apple device from another apple device so I'm kind of hosed
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:51.320]   so the ability I like the I like the fact that it makes that easier it connects to every other
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:57.400]   cloud servers and I also like the fact that it absolutely forced in a way that made him sound
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:03.720]   like he was he was trying to get poison out of his mouth it forced him to say the word google
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:08.840]   during an apple keynote and you know there was a lot of there was a lot of argument about that point
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:16.520]   Janie. So my background before I went into software development was like I said audio engineering
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:21.560]   and video editing so back 10 years ago when I was doing a lot of compositing and special effects
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.600]   stuff for video editing like I had a wackum tablet and I had the stupid little like like
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:31.880]   wackum stylus and I would have to sit there and like like draw on the table while looking at the
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:37.320]   screen and it was such a pain in the ass and I was so annoyed by it I kept wishing that there was
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:41.800]   some way that I could just draw directly on all of the different images that I was working on so
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:46.840]   when I saw that the iPad Pro was coming out a couple of years ago and they were including this
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.320]   pencil so that I could finally have this workflow that I thought I was going to that I wanted like
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:56.360]   10 years ago I was like really excited I went out and bought like a completely maxed out like first
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:01.880]   generation iPad Pro I was really excited I bought a pencil I bought all the stuff and I have never
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:08.360]   used any of these things the pencil is still in the box I occasionally come over and wipe all the
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:13.560]   dust off of the iPad Pro and sometimes I'll plug it in because I will go so long without using it
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:19.320]   that it will completely drain the battery without me ever having had touched it but like I think
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:24.680]   there's a lot of potential there for people doing creative work like I really wish that Apple would
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:32.600]   show some love to Final Cut Pro and Motion and really like integrate those with the iPad Pro because
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:39.480]   I would love to be able to go in and do my compositing on my iPad Pro take my my composited image put it
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:43.400]   into the cloud and be able to access it on my main computer I don't want to have to do all of my
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:49.480]   video editing on you know this this awkward 13 inch thing that I have to hold and give my self-carpal
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:55.400]   tunnel syndrome I like to be able to do my one piece of my workflow on that device and then be
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:04.120]   able to do the rest of my workflow somewhere else. That's interesting that you mentioned this
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:12.360]   because I think that's actually where the whole business is sort of headed is like this hybrid
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:19.400]   computing where you have like a handheld device like an iPad but the app that runs on the
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:30.280]   iPad actually is on a desktop machine so it's like you can see some of that with the logic remote or
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:41.400]   other apps like that where you actually use the iPad to control the desktop app and that makes it
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:50.040]   you know a very interesting experience and I think that's that's that's you know the big
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:58.120]   discussion of is gonna as macOS gonna evolve to be more like iOS or as it seems now as iOS
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:07.640]   evolving more to be like macOS and in the discussion I think needs to go into you know how do you
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:20.200]   leverage the best of both things and you know also the the topic of the file files app I consider this a
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:33.640]   big you know you know failure over the last couple of years because when Apple came out with the iOS
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:40.760]   first and they had removed all those files model with the you know hierarchical file system that
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:50.280]   you can't explain to anybody it's kind of it kind of was you know the the ideal thing to do but it
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:56.200]   seems like a couple years on they haven't figured out a good alternative so they are going back to
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:04.840]   the good old files and folders model instead of you know having been able to come up with a good
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:12.040]   alternative and that's where also I think the machine learning comes in it's like solving the
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:18.360]   problem of you know managing hundreds and thousands of files most notably with the photos
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:29.160]   you know indexing or you know tagging hundreds of thousands of photos is like a task that nobody
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:38.200]   can can do so machine learning is essential to being able to manage that kind of you know volume
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:48.040]   of information and so there's a couple of pieces that I see falling you know falling in place for
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:58.920]   you know a future operating system that might be down the line like in five to ten years
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:04.920]   well hopefully we'll see it coming when I talk about how I really wish that Apple would
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.320]   show some more love to the Mac things they could do if they just revamped the finder and said that
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:15.000]   we were using this was wonderful machine learning you may drink now to instead of navigating through
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.800]   files and folders and directories here is a tab that somebody says we think here here are documents
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:24.360]   you tend to use a lot on a Tuesday afternoon we're putting them here in case you need them the next
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:32.360]   time and we're not seeing any of that kind of at that kind of love so I really agree the way the
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:39.320]   brain works organizing information spatially and temporarily so it's like I want the file that I
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:48.680]   worked on last Tuesday when I said that the airport and and that kind of you know yeah that's that's
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:54.200]   that's definitely something where machine learning can help manage the information
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:03.400]   yeah there's definitely opportunity there before we go to our last commercial and then get to
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:09.960]   our picks of the week just a quick mention that let's salute let's do our Hunger Games salute to
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:17.720]   the fallen no no mention of the iPad mini not looking good for the iPad mini no mention of the
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:22.280]   Mac mini which was surprising and I've been looking all night to see well maybe someone talked to
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:28.920]   somebody and Apple said something there so I don't think the Mac mini is dead but then again I'm sorry
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:35.560]   to say that I did turn up in April Apple did say we think that the Mac mini is a very important
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:42.280]   part of the Mac's future in which you know oh god time it's time for the Mac mini to update
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:47.000]   its LinkedIn profile because that's not a good thing to hear the boss say so let's let's keep your
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.320]   finger fingers Proscas I think they're I think they're trying to say that with with some credibility
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:38:00.440]   that the that the that the iMac is sort of like the default Mac the default desktop Mac for sure
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:04.920]   and maybe they're trying to figure out where the Mac mini sits in there I kind of like the Mac
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:09.960]   mini if I was my next desktop I think was going to be the Mac mini but let's see how that works out
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:15.720]   but we'll get to coming up next to our everyone's picks of the week but before that it's a last
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:21.720]   message from Leo Laporte sorry to interrupt I'll we'll get back to Mac break weekly in just a sec
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:26.520]   the picks of the week and all that but I got to tell you about our sponsor I came back just from
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:32.760]   vacation just to tell you about Zipper Cruder I love Zipper Cruder Zipper Cruder makes it easy to

[01:40:54.360 --> 01:41:00.280]   Thank you Leo from me and the gang time for picks of the week let's start off with Kelly Kelly
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.760]   what do you got for us today? First I'm sort of surprised to find out I'm in a gang.
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:13.560]   Oh you're in a gang. If you're you know it's funny you know once once someone realizes their
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.000]   prints are nowhere on the crime scene suddenly they're not part of the gang anymore.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.920]   I'm disappointed. Kelly I'm disappointed. It's a tourist mandatory.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:33.400]   I just didn't know um so my tips my my cool pick thing whatever is actually free I know sometimes I
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:40.040]   have really low cost ones and and this one actually doesn't cost you anything. Take your phone with
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:46.920]   the case on it and then and this is the the apple leather case this works with every case I've tried
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:54.280]   so far tuck a 20 into the back of your case because I have found that I am far more likely
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:42:00.280]   and it doesn't hurt the case at all if I can get it back there. It doesn't change how it fits or
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.960]   anything like that and I find that it's easier for me to leave the house without my wallet than it
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:12.040]   is without my phone and if I end up in a situation where apple pay doesn't work I can always um
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:17.080]   pull the 20 out of the back of my phone and get by until I can get to where my wallet is and
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:22.120]   and you know bring it with me going forward. So you know if I end up at lunch and don't have a
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:29.000]   credit card with me or something I can still pay and and that kind of thing so that's my free tip
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:34.200]   and I actually know someone who I mentioned that to and they bought a case for their phone so that
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:39.800]   they could tuck a 20 behind it so that they could do this going forward. My second pick is a very
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:45.720]   inexpensive pick and you can actually as I think you can sort of see it behind me most of the time
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:50.920]   and it's these little paper strips because you can use them to fold paper stars and learning to
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:57.480]   fold paper stars is very easy and it's the thing that I discovered before the fidget spinner was an
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:03.240]   option. So what I do sometimes when I'm thinking to myself when I'm when I'm thinking through a
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:07.800]   problem or I'm trying to troubleshoot something on my computer that isn't working like it should
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:13.160]   I fold a few paper stars. I also do this when I'm recording podcasts because it also helps me keep
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:17.800]   me helps keep me from typing and like I don't really have a really loud keyboard.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:22.600]   For people who are watching video Kelly just held up held up a very very tall decorative
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:29.320]   vase filled with what looks to be hundreds and hundreds of little 3D origami paper stars in
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:37.160]   in a rainbow of colors. Yes they are it's it's easy I get the little strips of paper from
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:43.480]   Kino Kunea which is the little bookstore here we have one in Portland and there
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:50.440]   it's it's a nice sort of relaxing thing it's sort of like paper cranes but I did a bunch of paper
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:55.400]   cranes and I never got them to come out looking nice so I fold paper stars it's very easy you
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:01.240]   sort of tie a little knot and then fold it all up and then you push in each side and it pops up
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:07.400]   into a star. It's pretty easy to learn and you can buy these little strips and they're a bunch of
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:13.400]   colors in the strips and can and that out here for you. So you get a bunch of colors and and
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:17.880]   you're only seeing three colors in this one because I'm partway through that one and there's more in
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:23.640]   this one here so that's like and then the red yellow and orange from these is the top of
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:31.000]   what's in the vase right now so that's the thing that I would offer you for people who find the
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.480]   fidget spinner sort of awkward or it wasn't really a thing sit down for a minute and fold a few
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:43.800]   paper stars and I also find it a little bit relaxing so there you go. Yep this is also why I learn
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:49.800]   ukulele I decided because my my computers were giving me so much trouble I thought that if I have
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:56.040]   something like a paintbrush or like a flute some skill I don't know how to do and every time like
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:00.440]   I have to reboot or I'm so frustrated that I really want to get them walk away if I just pick
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:05.240]   up this ukulele and practice a new chord I bet I could learn this thing and I'll be darned in 11
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:10.200]   months I learned four chords because maybe it says more about the more about the stability of my
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.880]   computers than anything else uh Janie uh what would you like to share with us
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.400]   Is she hi Mr. Rick and we're about over there
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.760]   Yeah say hi Julia
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:23.800]   She doesn't look very happy
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:30.200]   uh I have I get a lot of people who come and ask me for suggestions about like they're
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.880]   interested in learning Swift or they're interested in iOS programming and they always want to know
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:38.360]   like what I would recommend for them if they wanted to get into learning iOS programming so I've
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:44.440]   got a couple of suggestions um so if you're completely new to iOS and you haven't done anything at all
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:50.680]   with it um I highly recommend Ray Wenderlick's iOS apprentice and the Swift apprentice um both
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:55.320]   of those books are maintained and they're updated every single year so every time they change Swift
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:59.560]   every time they change the the operating system and any changes that are made that that gets
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:05.080]   maintained and so that one is one I'd recommend if you just getting started out and if you're more
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:10.360]   of an intermediate person I highly recommend um Hacking with Swift by Paul Hudson uh right now he
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:17.160]   has a WWDC um sale going on where you can get like six or seven of his books for only $50 and he
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:21.880]   also maintains those and they're really like awesome and they give you like like hands-on
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:25.800]   ability to go in and actually like type all of the code so you actually like learn it because if
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:30.200]   you just read it you're not going to do as well with it and like areas to do and um
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:36.760]   Swift style guides also on sale because it's WWDC and so is a Christina Bolton's uh
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:42.040]   Restful API book so just there's a lot of really awesome authors who are doing really cool
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:48.760]   um technical materials that have deals on their stuff for WWDC so um if you're looking to get
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:55.560]   into programming and you're interested in that that is my tip of the week. Supa all over what have
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:04.920]   you got? I've got the uh the best upgrade for MacBook Pro owners and that's uh cooling gel packs
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:12.360]   and I think you should get some uh they work fantastic they take your MacBook Pro from 1 gigahertz
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:18.440]   to 3.4 gigahertz so that's I think the most effective. So they are upgradable.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:28.920]   Yes, just cooling down when they get too hot that's like the tip of the week.
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:34.680]   You just want to you just want to back it down when you start to see like cracks forming when
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:40.600]   it's about to have one of those 1980s music video pros and rows, chatting to pieces. So so one of
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:48.680]   the interesting learnings was that um actually the uh the the uh the housing the MacBook Pro housing
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:57.320]   is actually quite good at uh transporting heat. So when I put the uh the MacBook Pro on the ice cubes
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:06.200]   I could use that um you know uh to cool myself down by putting my hands on the uh on the hand
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:15.880]   the wrist rat wrist rest um on the on the on the uh enclosure so that was pretty nice.
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:23.880]   So that's an excellent point. I think I still have like a a scar on like the outside of my big toe
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:29.240]   on my right foot because in summer months I'd be like sitting cross-legged on the floor with my
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:34.360]   MacBook like on my lap and that's where like the corner of it would hit me. And we'll always be
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:40.360]   do I really want to make this deadline or do I want to have any flesh left on my it's again
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:46.280]   again cooling is a problem with advanced CPUs. My my pick of the week is something that I've been
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:51.800]   resisting for quite a while uh but decided to give it a full shot a couple weeks ago. It's the
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:58.840]   Grammarly service you go to Grammarly.com it's a plugin for your browser and it's uh and it's a
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:04.440]   service for your Mac. What it is is it's an expanded grammar checker that works everywhere that you
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:11.720]   type text. So uh first this uh just last night I was writing my emails and I could uh I was using
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:16.760]   the the web client for Outlook and I can click the click a button in Grammarly inside this inside
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:22.920]   this the stock editor that's in Outlook and suddenly I get popped out into a Grammarly text editor
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:29.400]   where there is what I call the nudge column on the right as I type it is underlining some things
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:35.080]   with yellow saying that you know that you said actually twice before maybe you want to choose
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:39.560]   something else and we're also the I call it the nudge bar because we'll also do things like
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:45.320]   you know what when you say well that's sort of like a colloquialism isn't it and I want to say
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:49.240]   yes it is that makes it more folksy and accessible that's why I chose it.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:56.840]   But but but but I'm I find it's it really is quite handy to uh just remind you when you make certain
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:01.880]   things that are grammatically correct but maybe not great or even when you misplace a call
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:07.960]   comma or someplace uh or when you it won't automatically warn you I will not let you post this you just
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:12.520]   have this has this paragraph has an 18 word sentence and it it'll just remind you that maybe
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:17.560]   that's kind of maybe you should warn the reader that they may want to like get a drink of water
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:23.400]   before they start reading this sentence because it's it's kind of a marathon so the so it really
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:27.400]   is helping out a little bit the only other disadvantage of it aside from it pointing out that I'm not a
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:32.600]   great writer is that it really is kind of pricey if you buy it you can buy it on a yearly plan a
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:38.440]   quarterly plan or a monthly plan uh I think the first week's trial is free but uh they really
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:43.160]   want you to sign up for the yearly plan the yearly plan is 10 bucks a month quarterly it's 10
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:50.520]   20 bucks a month if you buy it for one month it's 30 bucks a month and I don't I feel like I feel like
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:56.280]   I that's a lot my money to spend for someone to tell me that after 20 or 30 years of writing
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:01.560]   professionally I still have a long way to go I know that believe me my interior monologue is
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:06.440]   nothing like that and it only charges me like six bucks a month but it's worth trying out
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:12.120]   you can get that free off of people from twitter exactly perfect on honest honest to god like my
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:16.600]   copy editors like that my second round of copy editing was always twitter because I post a link
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:21.800]   and then like I know that if it was if it was more than 500 words long the first eight responses
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:26.040]   would be typos and like sentences that didn't end properly or something like that and I was
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:30.280]   very very grateful to them uh if you don't if you don't want to buy the paid plan you can get
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:35.160]   the free version of it is a lot simpler it just a lot of the higher level sort of grammar checking
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:39.800]   doesn't kick in yet but it's still quite useful and if it what it it worked for me because I tried
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:45.320]   the free free version for a little while and found it helpful like really really deeply deeply
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:51.880]   read the privacy part of the website to say no under no circumstances is it going to like look at
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:56.760]   private message private emails I'm sending to someone and find a way to exploit that to sell
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:01.640]   me snow tires or something like that so it's pretty explicit so I'm confident with it so far so
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:06.760]   that's my pic of the week remarly so that's going to be it for this week uh well all that's left is
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:12.520]   to thank my three wonderful developers who came and helped us talk about an unpack uh WWDC Kelly
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:18.360]   Giamont of Appcamp for Girls uh thank you and for of course from Macobserver.com uh actually you
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.840]   were sort of I was hoping we could play like mixed doubles where we get like two journalists
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:27.080]   and two developers we could like play faster you're sort of straddling both you could have been like
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:31.400]   the the the invisible invisible player on third or something I don't know how that would work uh
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:34.920]   but Kelly how do people how do people get to see some of the wonderful stuff that you do
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:42.040]   uh well you can check out the website for Appcamp for Girls which is appcamp number four girls dot
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:49.320]   com and uh if you're in the WWDC area and happen to have time to listen to us today uh there is a
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:52.840]   fundraising party going on tomorrow evening that you should totally go to because it's gonna be a

[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:23.080]   the metal programming guide and where else you want people to know about.
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:29.640]   Um yeah so uh metal programming guide is available for pre-order on Amazon I want to make sure
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:34.600]   everybody knows that it will be up to date with metal 2 and all of the new shiny awesome stuff that
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:40.120]   has come out um the WWDC so it's not going to be like an iteration behind it will be in swift.

[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:45.160]   when we're talking about the iMac Pro. I couldn't help but mention but notice that when uh we asked
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:52.200]   our people can be buying one you said that you might be buying one more not one but one more iMac
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:58.440]   Pro suggesting perhaps that you already had one for testing but couldn't tell anybody about it.

[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:06.680]   into any trouble as a journalist. I listen but I don't necessarily have to disseminate.
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:11.720]   That's it for this week. Thanks to everybody for listening. You can all go back to work right
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:19.240]   now because break time is over. Come on you gold bricks. Those packages aren't going to sort
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:25.960]   themselves. An empty truck is an idle truck. That's specific for UPS and delivery drivers but
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:38.200]   the rest of you can agree. Thank you very much.
