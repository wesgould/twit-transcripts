[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.800]   Kind of some surprise news to join him here right now Andy Anaco from his home in
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.120]   New England and Baston hello Andrew
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.920]   Good to see you Renee Richie still in the south bay so he can't join us
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.600]   He's busy and Jim Dowernple who was at the event yesterday is supposed to join us
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   But I think he was called into a meeting
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.680]   Apparently the motley crew
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.640]   Fan Club had a last-minute party or something anyway, he'll join us a little bit later
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.800]   But hey all I need is you and me
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.380]   You and me babe
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.960]   Except that I'm worried because you I saw your tweet you said that you were watching the stream to cut out after 10 minutes
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.960]   So you took a walk? Yeah
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.680]   Well, I did give it 15 minutes literally
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.920]   Like you see the Apple logo you hear the music and then they lights go down
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.440]   They start the music and they start that the timeline of adventure and it literally like a 19
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.840]   Just after like the Apple 2 plus almost cut out and I
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.560]   Didn't get I couldn't get it back on my Mac book couldn't get pack on my iPad and after 15 minutes
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.600]   I'm like, okay, you know what I'm going to go for a little walk now. Actually you saw the best part
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.880]   I think you did the first 15 minutes was probably the best part
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.400]   But it was it was well everything was well predicted never there weren't any really big surprises
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   It was always going to be interesting to hear
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.800]   The first public appearance after the big FBI flap
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.880]   It would have been surprising to everybody if they had really
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.600]   Dedicated a big hunk of the of the media event to this given that the executives have spent so much time talking to the press
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.280]   And even talking to television about it
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.360]   But of course they had to get in that that first little salvo just to make sure there was that sound bite in there
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.680]   But yeah, otherwise there's really not a whole lot that was terribly surprising really the best news that I had
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.600]   was
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.440]   And of course you can see the you can see the keynote you can see the camera
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.520]   I watched my jammies later on that night
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.960]   But yeah, the best actually the best news was the pricing on a couple of different things
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.240]   Because it looks like Apple is getting a little bit more competitive and a little bit more aggressive on pricing
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.840]   Which is definitely welcome stuff to see and we'll walk through all the details there
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.720]   You know what I'd love to do if you can Jason Q up Tim Cooks remarks at the beginning because I think we should play those
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.280]   They were it was it was very concise in fact the whole the whole event was like clockwork exactly
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.920]   Like one hour and one minute. It was it was precisely time. Yeah, not a wasted word
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.760]   They did briefly acknowledge that you already know all this like there's nothing
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   I can't remember who it was
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.120]   But maybe he was when it was when we were talking about when it was Jaws when we were talking about the new iPhone or the iOS
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.120]   He says as you already know
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.640]   It was kind of like
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.280]   Exolishment that there is nothing new here
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.920]   But but I do think that Tim's remarks and that little video and we showed just a little bit of it and there's no audio
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   It's just music
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.760]   Reminding us that on April 1st, it's going to be the 40th anniversary of the incorporation of Apple computer
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.280]   So that's that was kind of a neat thing and they went very quickly through a bunch of products and terms and ideas
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.160]   Yeah, and that's it's always interesting to compare and compress contrast new Apple versus old Apple
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   I wonder how much time that would have spent
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:08.120]   Talking about history if they were still if it was still like the pre-iPhone days or the post-ipho just post-iPhone days
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.960]   It seems as though Apple has a much more interest greater interest in showing off that we're not just flashy modern watches and stuff like that
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.880]   We have a we have a history and we have a level of integrity that's been built over the past 30 or 40 years
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.000]   Some might say history some might say a little bit of coasting going on, but we'll kind of get into that
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.160]   I also of course after the event like that even like last night
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.600]   The FBI announced oh never mind
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.080]   Turns out they got McAfee to do it right or what I don't know we'll talk about that in just a little bit
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.280]   Okay, so we're gonna get Tim Tim's remarks ready. Hold on just a second. We'll do that in a moment and and
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.520]   Talk about those a little bit the FBI story
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.680]   And and we'll get our take on the new products from Apple of which I have already ordered
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.960]   Some but not all
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.720]   I'll tell you which ones and on some disappointment
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.040]   I have to say because there was a product I wanted to see that I didn't but first
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.920]   Let's remind you that our show today brought to you by those good folks at blue
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.840]   Apron the blue apron is a symbol actually it's a
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.760]   Kind of a subtle callback to the Cordol blue cooking school in Paris, France
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.200]   I didn't know this but apparently the apprentices at the Cordol blue not the chefs
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.360]   But the apprentices wear blue aprons. That's a sign that they're learning and that's kind of what blue apron is all about
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.000]   They don't say it's a cooking school in a box, but in a way it is, you know, I I love to cook
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.720]   I love to eat so if you love to eat unless you want to eat out every day you're gonna want to cook
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.120]   But at the end of the day, you don't want I mean the last thing you want to do is think about what you should make go to the store
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.560]   Get the ingredients that go home and cook it blue apron solves all that when I get home and
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.120]   There it is on my on my stoop the blue apron box refrigerated box with delicious
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.280]   Fresh ingredients for three different meals. I
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.200]   Just smile. I'm happy and I know I'm ready because I don't have to do any shopping everything
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.360]   Everything you need is in there if you need one scallion
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.440]   There's one scallion in there
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.760]   They don't waste any food either so you're not gonna have a lot of wasted food and the ingredients the recipe cards everything you need
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.520]   Even if you've never cooked before
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:26.000]   You can make something so amazing at blue apron the meals are less than ten dollars a meal
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.800]   You can get it for two or you can get it for a family. They have a family plan with with kid-friendly ingredients
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.600]   You can always choose what you want ahead of time the menu plans online. You could say I'd like this
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.440]   I don't want that you can also customize it for your own dietary needs of course you can vegetarian
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.880]   Gluten-free whatever it is you need you can get the right menu
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.160]   But I have to say be adventurous with blue apron because you'll start cooking with ingredients at least I did that
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.360]   I'd never used before you'll learn new techniques you'll learn new meals
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:01.600]   They have videos on the site that show you if you have any prep you know questions and every meal can be done in 40 minutes or less
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   They range between five and seven hundred calories. They're always well-balanced delicious
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:13.880]   Things like I don't even know what this is duka spiced cod. I don't know what duke is but see that's what you do you learn
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.720]   With warm marinated beaten carrot salad or cheesy enchiladas or ahas with mixed mushrooms in Spanish
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.000]   Oh, I hate doing these nights because it makes me hungry. I
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.920]   Love my blue apron learn a new recipe. They never repeat by the way
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.600]   So you don't you're always gonna try something fresh, but once you've cooked it, you know all of a sudden you kind of know how to do it
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.240]   Look get your first two meals free and try this
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.840]   I think you'll really appreciate it and your kids will if you're trying to meet somebody, you know, you want to
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.960]   Date night this will impress like nothing else
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.680]   Blue apron comms slash tweet your first two meals free blue apron
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.640]   Dot-com slash to it. We thank her for their support a mac break
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   weekly
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.560]   So let's I thought I was really impressed with Tim Cook
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.720]   What did you think Andy? I mean I just felt like that was it was short, but it was really to the point
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   Absolutely, it has something to do
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.800]   I think of the fact that when you have a small audience there at town hall
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.240]   You also don't you have fewer seats for press
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.920]   So it's it's it's a smaller room
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.840]   So you really can't make those sweeping statements that are applause cues and also you have fewer
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.600]   seats that aren't being filled by press and analysts
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:36.120]   So you have fewer people that are sincerely but partisan excited about stuff that's going on
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.520]   So yeah, it really was bop bop bop bop let's get from start to finish also to be honest
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.400]   They had a lot it was a real catch-all presentation which they showed off a
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:56.040]   Rat if a brand new iPhone, but it was really the hardware was familiar all the features were familiar really was just let's find a way to freshen up
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.280]   The to freshen up the our entry-level find for iPhone so that works
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.120]   So there wasn't as though there's a lot of new stuff there the new iPad Pro
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:10.960]   Also, it was mostly let's see how much of the new of the old iPad Pro
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.960]   We can fit into the 9.7 inch form factor
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.000]   There are a bunch of really nice new features into it
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.560]   But nothing that really required bringing out two different people in sequence to demonstrate something that everybody in the room didn't understand
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.160]   The new pricing was easy new watch bands was easy
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.800]   So I think that they really appreciated that this was not the time to show three different videos about
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.320]   the formulation of
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:39.400]   aluminium in the new case and this was not a case another opportunity to bring out a band or to really spend a lot of time talking about
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.000]   Here is what here is that here are the figures about Apple music and here's the figures about also the stuff
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.880]   No, these people just want to get in get out. They could they could have installed a drive-through window for this one
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.920]   Yeah, actually now that I think about it. No Johnny. I have no Craig Federighi. No eddy Q
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:59.040]   No, Bono. No Dave Grohl. No, I mean it was no Jimmy Iovine
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.560]   It was I was I was pleased that they had they were the first non
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.400]   Non CEO face up there was a woman
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.640]   That was not an accident. I'm sure right exactly well because Apple
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.120]   It's not as though Apple has been very very bad about hiring women to senior positions although that is a very
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:25.800]   White male of senior executive board you see on the webpage, but however they I think that they've only recently come to appreciate that
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.760]   You can do a lot of help by making sure that when you present your public face
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.360]   You're presenting the full diversity of the faces within your organization
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:42.300]   So and the fact that she was coming out to I'm sorry that the Lisa Jackson. She's a vice president of environmental policy and social
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.840]   Initiatives former EPA director like 13 years 16 years EPA
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.920]   She was a major administrator until 2013 when Apple hired her so she's a very high-level environmental person
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:58.740]   Yeah, and the fact that would turn over such a big hunk of such a compressed media event to just here's here's how much we're doing
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.000]   To aid an iPhone recycling. Here's how much thought we're putting into the just the packaging
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.260]   Honestly, I almost think you could write an entire book just about how much work that Apple puts into the packaging both the design and the thoughtfulness about
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.500]   Really that's like oh, that's almost like all all legs of the tripod because it really tickles Apple from a design
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:25.640]   Standpoint so that when you buy this iPhone you get this box that the top and bottom are perfectly fitted the corners are
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:31.240]   Absolutely tight it tickles them when you have when they are making stuff out of recyclable and
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.700]   responsible materials and also tickles them when they figure out a way to package something like
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:44.840]   Something like anything from the Apple TV all the way to the Macbooks so that if they can knock another five millimeters off the package of it
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.240]   That's more of these devices. They can fit into each master case eat more cases
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.920]   They can fit in each container and that's gonna save the money on shipping them overseas
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:00.080]   So honestly, there's I think I think you tell the whole story of Apple just by really unwrapping one box from start to finish
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.960]   I do feel guilty. I love the packaging, but I do feel guilty. So it was really nice to hear
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   Jackson talk about
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:15.940]   Recycling I didn't know so much of that paper was recycled much of it comes from a renewable resources forest, you know renewable forestry
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:23.260]   So that they they actually steward and make sure that those trees get replanted and that so that makes me feel a little bit better
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.680]   Because there is a lot of you know the packaging in there. Let's let's start though
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.420]   after this quick slideshow of the history of
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.600]   40 years of Apple computers starting April 1st
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.860]   1976 and they says Apple what did they say to say Apple one or
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.800]   666 dollars and 66 cents and then
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.720]   They went through some of the products. I noted that the Newton and maybe I'm reading too much into this
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.720]   But when they showed the Newton they crossed it out
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:59.820]   Which Steve would have done Steve always jobs always thought the Newton was a horrific product because it was created under John Scully and
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.340]   cancelled as soon as he you know
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:09.760]   You know it was like that's it on the Newton do it anymore that so I don't know if that was a little nod from Tim Cook to Steve
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.760]   To cross out the Newton or just the fact that it was the first handwriting device that Apple made
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.920]   Maybe or maybe it was just an acknowledgement that Apple didn't have 100% successes all the way across the board good
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.680]   And yeah, and also and also it's it's
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.400]   I don't doubt that
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.300]   From what we've read about Steve jobs that he might have thought of anything that was Scully's idea
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.900]   Can't have been a good idea and we want to I want to start fresh
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.520]   But another part of it was certainly that at the time that he came that that
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.960]   scribble scribble
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.920]   They could they could they could have just called it egg freckles and that could have been decadent to
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.560]   But do remember that at the time that Apple had way too many products and they were really really going south
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.040]   They really need to come back to that
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:58.840]   Remember that that that four square grid and the Newton did not fit in anywhere within that four square grid of products that Apple is capable of making
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.580]   So and yet you can't deny that the Newton is a spiritual
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:09.020]   For father of the iPhone and what they learned making the Newton actually informed a lot of what they did when they made the iPhone
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.180]   Not only that but the Newton informed a lot of what other makers were able to do
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:19.020]   I mean palm created the successful version of the Newton by throwing out the things that made it into an
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:24.980]   $800 device and figuring out a way to make it into a $300 device that fit inside a shirt pocket and that really
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.980]   Inspired a lot of other makers to create these PDA sized
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:36.500]   Devices that could then be translated very very nicely into into phones. I think you could almost say that the modern touchscreen phone
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:42.360]   Originally ran palm OS because there was a probably a handspring device, but that's with that
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.900]   GSM cartridge that you could plug into it. Yeah, so it was a
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.140]   Right wasn't it the vice exactly? Yeah
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:53.060]   So if Apple wants to take credit for that absolutely
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.900]   If they want to turn the minute to a huge success
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:03.300]   Well, it's everybody everybody inspires everybody else and that's why when Apple, you know kind of yells at people for copying them
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.740]   Well, it's just it's all kind of mutual everybody learns
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.120]   Next generation there is some outright theft. Let's yeah
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.660]   Well, there's copying with an intent to confuse or the intent to
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:22.120]   Duplicate and there's and there's inspiration or homage and that's and that's an artistic
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:28.260]   Tradition it's like what when Samsung makes a music app the icon looks exactly like the existing
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.740]   I do yeah, and but on the other hand there's so much of so much of what feeds the development technology is
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.460]   Company a looking at the worker company B saying wow, that's a really great idea and not copying it
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.260]   But saying gee we just let's take this idea off the drawing board and start over again
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.260]   But we know how we think we can figure out where Apple might have done better with this
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:52.100]   And and all that kind of stuff after go ahead. I was just saying after this. I'm sorry
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.380]   You're after you have to you Alfonse
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:01.180]   I just I was just I couldn't remember the name of the the iPhone recycling robot
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:10.660]   I'm gonna kind of go consecutively here. So okay, let's start with Tim Cook we have I think and I think we could show it in
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:15.900]   Its entirety. It's only a few minutes Tim was really the MC of this and this is real boy
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.140]   You really see his stamp on the company now
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:23.980]   It's finally really become Tim Cook's company and it's always been clear. He really wasn't comfortable being the demo guy
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.260]   So he's the MC who introduces other people
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.500]   But he did have a very important thing to say because at the time
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.540]   We thought the next thing that was gonna happen was the the court case go ahead and you can bring up the fine
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.300]   You'll hear the cameras going crazy here. There were a lot of press
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.900]   There I think just for this
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.100]   Welcome to our town hall on the infinite loot campus
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.900]   Normally we don't spend a lot of time looking back
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:55.820]   But yes, we are about to celebrate apples 40th birthday on April 1st
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:10.700]   List some of the amazing products and epic moments in our history and reminds us just how many times Apple has changed the world
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:16.620]   Recently we passed a major milestone
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.780]   That no one could have ever imagined
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:26.940]   There are now more than one billion Apple devices in use around the world
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:42.260]   This is an incredible milestone for us and an indicator of how much impact Apple has on people around the world
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:48.700]   Our products are such and yeah, isn't it yeah, there's about 300 people in there
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:54.620]   It's not many and with that I think it's less than that and many of them were Apple employees, so yeah
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:19:02.300]   I'd like to address something that I know is on the minds of many people this morning
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.900]   Getting well into being the public basically
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:12.420]   Our customers like this and we know that it is a deeply personal device
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.420]   For many of us the iPhone is an extension of ourselves
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.980]   About a month ago
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.700]   We asked Americans across the country to join in a conversation
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.940]   We need to decide as a nation
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:38.260]   How much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy?
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.900]   I've been humbled and deeply grateful
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:52.060]   For the outpouring of support that we've received from Americans across the country from all walks of life
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:59.060]   We did not expect to be in this position at odds with our own government
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:04.660]   But we believe strongly that we have a responsibility
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.820]   to help you protect your data and
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.220]   protect your privacy
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:17.260]   We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:24.180]   This is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.700]   From this responsibility you could tell me very
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:34.100]   Carefully wrote that and thought that out and it was concise, but it exactly stated their position
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.740]   Yeah
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:42.780]   And this is the exact reason why you need to have a CEO who is a personality who is a recognizable face of the organization because if
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.980]   If an apples an apple spokesman comes out and says something like that
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.780]   It really doesn't have much weight and remember that this is an environment in which people are saying
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.340]   Well, why one why isn't apple willing to just let the FBI have access to this phone?
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.700]   Why is this no different? Why isn't this any different from the FBI? They have a warrant?
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.700]   Why aren't they just letting them get into break the lock in this guy's house so they can actually search the contents of the house?
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.340]   If it's a faceless organization
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.900]   It's hard to get that message across that this isn't but when you have someone like Tim Cook
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.900]   So who now who now has at least five four or five years of experience of being the face of the company?
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.820]   He has the ability to say look this is not just we're not just being jerks here
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.900]   We're not just trying to protect our own technology
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:28.740]   We feel as this is a core principle of the company and we think that we will do right by the people that we serve by selling them products
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.740]   by making sure that we are
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:36.220]   Standing up to the principles that that they that we that we've already always professed so
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.540]   This is a super performance by Tim and not using
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:47.300]   Performance in a derogatory way part of that horrible job of being a CEO on a company like Apple is that you do have to be out there
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:54.260]   And you your face has to be the face that's telling things that make statements on the basis of the company other CEOs have the ability to just
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.940]   Stand behind a desk and occasionally show up that met met opera fundraisers and stuff like that
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:05.420]   He really does have to tell the story of Apple. He did a really good job of it the other day
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:11.460]   Yeah, it's very the statement begins with we didn't expect to be in this position at odds with our own government
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:18.740]   And I think that that's kind of yeah, that synthesizes this issue. I think it says we're uncomfortable. We don't like to say no
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.940]   to our own government, but
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.980]   He says we owe it to our customers and this is really distinct from the government
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.500]   We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:35.220]   Exactly. This is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility. That is a that is
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:42.180]   That is Churchillian in its succinctness and its power and and it very much
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.380]   I think communicates the point of view that that Apple and Tim Cook wanted to communicate
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.500]   We can't I've we've all
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.940]   All of us in the tech press have been trying to explain to people why
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.620]   analogies about
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:03.180]   Serving a warrant on an apartment and forcing the lock of a door all these analogies just don't work because this is something brand new
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.140]   You really have to deal with the actual issues that are at hand
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:12.740]   And so it's hard to convince the people that this is different from anything else that the law enforcement says had
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.860]   Have had to ask for or deal with before and as such it's not
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.460]   It's a very smart move for part of that conversation Apple's happening to say look
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.180]   This is this is a patriotic thing that we're doing we believe in rights and we're a country about rights
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.740]   And so we are we are forced to
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:34.620]   Tell the government that if you think that this is legal then you're gonna have to prove it using the system
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.620]   That's been in place for the past couple hundred years
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:43.620]   So there's a policy walk blog called the hill a lot of people in Washington reading the hill
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.580]   likened this case to a locker that
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:53.820]   There was a lock on it and the FBI is merely asking for assistance and breaking the lock so they can search the locker and
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.660]   Somebody I think in the I think was in the comments and quite perfectly said no
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:05.100]   It's not that what what the FBI is asking is that the hinges on the locker be turned around and placed on the outside
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.100]   So it's easy for them to get in
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.900]   But of course that makes it easy for anybody to get in they want them not just like open this locker
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.820]   But modify lockers in general night. I think when you put it that way, it's a little bit a little bit clearer
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.020]   What's his stake here? I also think it's Tim Cook's company in
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.820]   the
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.660]   presentation itself to start with Lisa Jackson and talk about
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:33.220]   Environment and then follow that with talk about health kit research kit and the new care kit which will allow
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:38.420]   Healthcare providers to work directly with patients to monitor their own care
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:45.740]   That's really a different apple from Steve Jobs Apple where you don't feel like you felt like he was drag kicking and screaming to
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.180]   environmentalism Greenpeace kind of made him do it and
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.340]   You know and obviously towards the end of his life Steve got very interested in health
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:59.580]   So there's there's that but I feel like this is Tim. This is easier causes Tim Cook really cares about
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:07.460]   I wouldn't I wouldn't guess part of all this interesting conversation is about what would Steve have done if
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:12.820]   If he were around and healthy in 2016 and this is the Apple yeah
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:18.620]   I'm saying what no if this is the apple he's in charge of where Apple is absolutely 100% in charge of its own destiny
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:24.100]   When he was getting sick he was they were getting there, but they weren't quite there yet
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.040]   So maybe he would have been more public and also we don't know about things that he
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.700]   Police that he had that kept private or charitable things he did that he kept private or I'm sorry at least
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:41.020]   I don't know so but it's I'm glad to see that if Tim looked a little bit awkward when he started making public appearances like this
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.460]   now he feels he really does look like he's completely in command and in control of the message that he's sending out and
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:52.700]   I'm believe me. Oh, this is this is the guy who has been at ease in the past couple of years talking about
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:59.980]   Hey, look if if I feel as though if I've become convinced that I can help out a lot of people by instead of just simply
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.380]   waving off questions
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.740]   About about my homosexuality to simply acknowledge acknowledging it in the front to
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.540]   Say look I'm a success
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:16.300]   I'm the head of the most one of the most successful companies in the entire world and I'm going to tell you right now that yes, absolutely
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:23.180]   It's been part of my identity and it's part is it's informed all of my experiences and therefore all of the choices that that I make in life
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.420]   So yeah, it's not hard to imagine him also
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.300]   being being a very soft touch for
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.740]   New environmental directions new humanitarian directions
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.620]   And it is one of the reasons why it's very very exciting to see what Apple's gonna do
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.400]   I've said before that health kit is one of the most significant things Apple has ever done
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.700]   I don't I don't think Apple Watch is important
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.460]   It's it's I really it really does come across to me as just another gadget watch
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:55.740]   But health kit is real game-changing life-changing life-improving stuff and I think it's one of those important things that Apple is doing right now
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.620]   Yeah, in fact, it may not be the watch that becomes the accessory that makes health kit a you know
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:05.060]   So important a live core which is the kundotra the guy who was at Google with the Google Plus when he left Google
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.660]   He's joined a live core and that is a kind of an ECG
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.460]   Band that you can then send the data to health kit
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:19.180]   I mean, there's some very interesting stuff being developed and with much more sophistication and capabilities than an Apple Watch
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:26.420]   It is telling though that if if you look back at the at the at the whole event the one-hour event
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.980]   The most personality the most interesting character was a robot
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.900]   Liam the robot that takes apart
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:38.260]   iPhone
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:44.580]   But true innovation means considering what happens to a product at every stage of life cycle
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:51.100]   This is this is a critisism of Apple and and all these companies these devices are so hard to recycle
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.220]   No recycler can do it. So Apple had to make a device that could take apart an iPhone
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:02.060]   Yeah, also repurposing this stuff a lot of stuff is still perfectly good
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.020]   They've they spent a lot of time talking about the recyclable materials
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.780]   They put into the stuff they haven't spent a lot of time talking about well. How do you get that those materials out?
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.780]   And
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:18.580]   This is what this is what you do when you have all the resources of Apple you can build really sophisticated machines
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:23.780]   Who's only possible job it is to disassemble your own devices? No one else is gonna be
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.460]   That's why they named it Liam because it has a very particular set of skills
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.300]   Maybe
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:36.020]   It actually it looked like they implied that they not only but it removes the screws from the iPhone
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.180]   So if they can be reused
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.660]   Which is pretty cool now? I imagine there's a fleet of Liam's
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.900]   I'd be I'd be surprised if the screws are being reused
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.380]   Didn't they imply that some of us being reused maybe the
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.740]   Recycle it's just that screws. It's it's not just removing them
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.260]   It's also putting them into a palette so that a machine can then be loaded putting into a magazine
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.660]   So there's machines can then use them effectively it seems though it's cheaper just to melt them down
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:08.740]   There was a question that was brought up last night on one of the blogs that was confusing to some people in that
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.340]   They were Phillips head screwdrivers Phillips head screws. Those are not the screws in the iPhone are they?
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:19.300]   Some pentelibs there aren't there. No, they're all Phillips. Okay. Now there must be somewhere in there some Phillips
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:24.460]   I don't know that's interesting. Well, also there's some also there are old phones that are gonna take care of - that's true
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:33.540]   Maybe maybe maybe Liam also has a special I fix it mode right people people who bought the replacement screw kit from that one incidentally
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.140]   Don't leave your phone in the room anywhere nearly
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.860]   Oh you wanted that
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:49.680]   I was surprised you still wanted your iPhone for now that we have the pretty beautiful new SE and also we've tried the the
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:57.120]   Force touch feature on the iPhone 6 the biggest news of the event was not during the event but was later that evening when the
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:03.560]   Justice Department on Monday night said, you know what turns out we might not need Apple's help
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.080]   They went to the judge
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.800]   magistrate judge a sherry pimp and said
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.400]   Let's postpone the hearing it was gonna be today. It was gonna be in an hour and
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.240]   They postponed it
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   They said an outside party
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.920]   Had demonstrated a way for the FBI to possibly unlock the phone. They're leaving a door open to go back to court if they need to
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.240]   the hearing
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.480]   Is been postponed
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.520]   Yeah, well partly partly because this is as it was explained to me by somebody this morning
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.760]   It's this is a component of the all-rich act
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.840]   They can't they can't cite this act unless they can prove that look the reason why we're trying to come to do this
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.240]   Is that we don't have the ability to do this ourselves
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:50.760]   And so if they if they have figured out that there are the doors at least open for them to find this technique
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:55.560]   They are obligated to pursue that line before they can really try to aggressively
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.760]   Force Apple to do something that they don't they don't want to comply with
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:07.700]   It's I don't know what what you've been reading. I'm trying to I haven't found any sources on exactly who has found this hypothetical
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.960]   a weakness in the passcode system, but
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.760]   Apparently it really goes to show that they are they are rattling every single case
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.800]   They're twisting every single doorknob to try to get into this thing
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.560]   I still don't think that they
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.200]   Pick this case as a way to try to create a president
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.600]   I really do think it was all about at least in the prosecutorial
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.040]   Area a way to get into this one phone
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:39.280]   You could also make the case that maybe they saw going against them and decided though. Let's punt now
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.200]   They say they will try this new technique, which of course didn't reveal its source and
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:49.440]   Let the judge know by April 5th if it works or if they need to go back to court
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:58.200]   The LA Times wrote the dumbest article speculating some of it was legit how Apple might have you know?
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   who might they pointed out that
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.640]   Daniel Khan Gilmore who is at the ACLU a technology fellow there pointed out that
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.720]   You might be able to copy the memory where the encryption
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.120]   Passkey lies because that's the only thing gets erased if you try ten times
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.000]   He doesn't erase the whole phone just erases the passkey. That's enough to scramble the phone
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.780]   And it is apparently if you could strip the chips you possible to copy that
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.360]   Data and that would give you at least time
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.960]   But I don't think that's it because even if you could every ten times restore the phone's passcode
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.240]   It's still gonna take a very long time to go through even ten thousand passcodes with that delay
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.320]   Built in their second theory is the FBI's bluffing because it needs more time
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:48.000]   I want the case to die down no the NSA stepped in as an interesting thought because everybody's kind of just kind of
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.200]   Speculate the NSA might have a zero day
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:56.280]   It probably does Snowden said that they were working on zero days for just this kind of thing
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:03.920]   Maybe the Apple Apple found a way to do it that this you know remember that Apple's initial reaction
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.560]   To this case was let's not talk about this in public Ixnay on the court thing
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.440]   We can probably help you just shut up and then
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.400]   To their dismay the Department of Justice decided to make this public. That's when Tim Cook published his blog post
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.840]   but the final
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   Guess really kind of to me
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:28.320]   Burnt the whole article John McAfee cracked the iPhone they said what now we're now McAfee's already said no
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.320]   I lied. I don't know how to
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.960]   Admit it. I just wanted the attention. I lied
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:40.680]   So the LA Times says McAfee didn't immediately respond to a request for a cop
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:49.640]   Yeah, you know you talk big at the bar and then we're trying to try to pick up men or women
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:54.000]   And then you realize that oh this is getting out of hands. It wasn't just the bar was CNN, but okay or whatever. Yeah
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:03.120]   If only two if only more people were that smart to realize that if I if I push the eject button right now
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.240]   I look like an idiot if I wait two more weeks
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.280]   Then I either go to jail or that I don't have the ability to put this behind me at all
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.600]   So I
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:18.120]   Be backed out of that as quickly as you did you I have been hearing the NSA rumor for quite a while right?
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.640]   I I have been told in unrelated stories unrelated cases at their times where
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:29.240]   Departments don't like to talk to each other. They don't really like to share information with each other also
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.520]   They don't as a matter of procedure
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.240]   They don't really like to let on that they can do the things they can do even to fellow agencies
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:44.560]   So I've I've been hearing the rumor that perhaps there there is some agency that already knows how to do this
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.880]   But there is too big of a firewall between these two agencies to let that happen
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.320]   There's and there's also as you said there's a possibility that
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.680]   Either one of these companies has decided to punt
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:01.200]   I don't think it would be Apple because they've stuck their neck out way too far on the side of defending
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.800]   defending users to
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.320]   Go in through go into the service entrance dress as UPS guy
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:15.080]   To to help the FBI crack that phone at this point. However, it's not impossible to think that at some level
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.360]   The government is saying we're not getting any we're not getting any leeway here rather than lose a case
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.040]   It would be very expensive. Let's just see how far we can get without it
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.800]   But the the actual the real-life problem is that again if they have the if they think that they've got a line
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.720]   Towards cracking this phone on their own. They are required to do that or else the y'all Ritz act is not applied
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.280]   Yeah, it's I have to say though. This is I can't imagine this is
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.600]   What the Department of Justice was hoping for I mean it was obviously they want to unlock the phone
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:48.240]   But it's a little embarrassing. I mean James Comey of the FBI testified to Congress
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.400]   We can't do this it is you know, they were very adamant. There's no way we can't do this
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:59.520]   They told Congress we have to get Apple so to back down at this 11th hour and say oh
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.600]   Maybe we can't that's got to be a little embarrassing. Don't you think?
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.840]   It shouldn't be because because the nature of the problem
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:13.120]   You don't you don't know you can't you don't know that you can do something until suddenly you figure out how you can do it
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.040]   So I don't think that's terribly suspicious my own my own way
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:23.760]   But if it's it would be embarrassing for them to use so much political capital at the at the the chief level
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.240]   With what they've been doing right now and then have to say that okay never mind
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.720]   We're not gonna try to force you to do anything you don't want to do they say they'd a dozen court filings saying
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.560]   We can't do it. We can't do of course. That's that's where that's how you have pursued this case
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   You have to say there's no other way
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.720]   And so once you know that's honorable once they discover maybe there is a way
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.240]   It's honorable to say wait a minute. Okay, maybe we don't have to it's all
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:55.280]   Little requirement. Yeah, but again, it's possible that they just figure this out or someone in the organization finally
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:01.760]   Pipped up and said I've got an idea. I don't know if it'll work, but it's now worth us pursuing. I also feel that
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:07.800]   It's just kicking the can down the road because this is not the end of this
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:12.920]   There is this fundamental issue that many in government not all
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:19.680]   Not apparently the NSA but many in government the president feel like this kind of
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:26.000]   End-to-end encryption is not a good thing and and the government needs some law enforcement need some way to get through it
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   And I know I think we're gonna see this again
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.960]   If not this case in another case, don't you?
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.920]   Yeah, it's it's a basic question that's gonna have to be asked and answered
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:40.040]   I think that anybody who insists that there is no downside to perfect end-to-end encryption
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:47.840]   Hasn't really thought about this too much. It's just just like there's a lot of there's a lot of problems that get created by our by the
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.680]   First Amendment and there are a lot of problems that get created by the Second Amendment and the reason why we've decided to just
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:38:00.120]   Take the bad because it's because we think that the good or excuse me that the public will is such that
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:07.320]   They think that the good exceeds the bad. So it's not as though making sure that anybody can write or say anything about anybody at any time
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:13.800]   Is necessary doesn't necessarily come with the downside. It's a lot more alarming when you face the facts of what happens if
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.880]   End-to-end encryption becomes so simple and so easy
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:25.000]   That anybody can just simply without even having to flip a switch just keeping the defaults on their iPhone where they are
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.760]   create a system of taking notes and communicating and
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:37.640]   Sharing locations with accomplices in such a way that it would be almost impossible for any government agency to possibly track them
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.080]   I think the principle is more important than the damage that might be done
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:47.320]   However, it is a reasonable and rational argument to say that it's a bad thing to allow criminals to simply
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.820]   Be able to to facilitate their ability to coordinate their efforts. Yeah
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:57.000]   It feels complicated, but maybe I've been watching too much house of cards
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.920]   But I feel like there also maybe games some gamesmanship here like if we can delay it
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:06.040]   We're waiting for a new Supreme Court justice. Maybe this isn't the most favorable condition right now
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.720]   Although I can't see that it would get more favorable if Obama's nomination gets through
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:16.280]   Yeah, maybe they think the Congress is going to act and they want to wait and give Congress a chance. I don't know I
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.680]   Don't know look look in the situation
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.040]   I don't know if if the FBI would see a downside to waiting
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:29.040]   They it's kind of cost them a lot of political capital in order to put this through this isn't election year
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.720]   But unfortunately you have standard bearers who are kind of certifiably nuts
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:41.160]   And do you really do you really think that Ted Cruz or Donald Trump would apply would apply this principle the way that the FBI would
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.240]   Want it they've already very well. Yes, they've already very clearly said
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.040]   The Apple must and should comply
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.320]   I mean, I mean do you think that they would apply it the way that the FBI wants to which is to say that we have the FBI's
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.760]   Statements I think are pretty consistent even even at the top level
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.580]   Which is that it's our job to keep people safe through through the laws have been given to us through as a
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:07.880]   Enforces a law enforcement and we just want the ability to when we have a when there has been a proper process
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:14.480]   Filed and approved through an independent agency this the courts to allow us to have information that is private
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   We need to have the ability to get that private information
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:22.040]   I don't think that Cruz or I think the crews are Trump. I don't want to turn this into a political con
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:31.120]   Political discussion, but just today Cruz has said that they will he would he approves of police having added surveillance and containment
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.600]   powers over
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.720]   American Muslim communities based on what happened in Belgium yesterday
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:45.920]   And do you think that someone with that kind of power would not simply say we're just gonna simply force anybody to turn over any data on any kind
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.080]   And we're gonna basically allow e warrants to be issued so that all they have to do is
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.920]   All they have to do is file something electronically and they'll be almost almost automatic approval
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:03.040]   From a centralized agency that has no jurisdiction within say we don't trust this kind of power with nuts and
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.800]   Trump and Cruz unfortunately there
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:12.560]   They I should I'm gonna I'm gonna qualify by saying that these statements that I have heard from both of these candidates are
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.560]   Consistently aligned with what I would associate with not behavior
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:24.520]   Law and order the law and order candidates. I mean traditionally Republicans are the law and order candidates
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.160]   Oh, but again, there's there's a side with law enforcement, right?
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:31.440]   Yeah, even conserve even conservative law and law and order candidates
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:36.320]   They don't want the government to have power over innocent people
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.920]   No, in fact Cruz said it's interesting Cruz kind of
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.600]   Split the baby. He said well you got you they should comply with this warrant obviously
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.720]   But I fear what what foreign governments might do with this kind of power
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:56.200]   So I think he I think he at least understands the that there there's it's a more complicated issue than just should Apple help law enforcement here
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.640]   Yeah, so it's it's super complicated if we if we had a more
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:07.320]   Rational Republican candidates. I mean that anybody who was considered incredible candidate a year ago
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.560]   I think the metrics on this would be a much different
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.000]   I honestly can't say or predict what the FBI is thinking right now
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.920]   I do think that there I do think that they've consistently seem to have been presenting a
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:27.220]   Public face that they are just they just want to get into this one phone that they're not necessarily trying to
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.500]   Subtle an argument for once and forever
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:36.840]   But I agree that there is a certain wisdom and they're deciding to choose that choose their battleground really really carefully
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   And this might not be the right place. Yeah
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:44.040]   All right, so there you go and we'll April 5th. We may hear more
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:50.240]   That's not so far off at that guess it gives a gives the FBI a couple of weeks to
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:56.360]   Attempt to crack this phone with some technique that they have recently learned if it doesn't work
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.440]   They'll go back to court and that's not to say the doors closed for I'm sure that Apple is still talking to the FBI in
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.360]   Back channels not doing something sneaky
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:10.160]   But simply saying is there still a way that we can help you get access to this phone without requiring us to invent something brand new that
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:17.400]   Compromises our own security because they have been very very consistent about saying we are we are in there up to our up to our elbows
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:23.680]   To help you in any way that does not involve us having to break our own device and incidentally
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.240]   Well, Tim Cook has never said it. I don't think there's any question that is
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.320]   should
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.600]   The appeals be exhausted in the Supreme Court say unlock the phone that they'll unlock the phone
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.440]   I mean they'll they'll comply with the law. I don't think Apple's saying we're gonna defy the law although
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.760]   it's interesting because a
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:48.720]   number of reports say that the engineers who would be actually required to write the code might well walk out if
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.400]   Asked to do so and take another job and that would not be illegal. They just say no, you know
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   It has nothing to do with this. I just quit
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.800]   And of course they could quickly find another job
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:03.080]   Their skilled engineers, that's an interesting that would be an interesting turn of events
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:08.280]   I don't know what would happen if that happened. Yeah, that does sound like the oh man if Trump gets elected a move to Canada
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:16.680]   It does sound like that doesn't it? Yeah, maybe it's a lot of some people would but it's something that's really easy to say when it's a completely abstract thing
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:24.000]   Right, I feel as I feel as though Apple would is the sort of company that you know the old story about the the firing squad
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.160]   Where one one gunman is given like a blank cartridge so that everyone can pretend that they're firing at the
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.480]   Execution squad that everyone can pretend that you've got the rifle that has the blank cartridge
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:40.480]   So you're not firing a fatal shot. I would not be surprised if they simply said we are not going to demand anybody work on this project
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.720]   because
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.400]   Compliance is another problem of this sort of court order
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:51.760]   Are they required to furnish a list of the ten absolute best people that are most qualified to do this and
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.440]   require to make those ten people work or they simply required to
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.880]   furnish a solution so they could just simply say
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:04.240]   Anybody who does not work want to work on this does not have to work on this they would wind up with a list of
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:10.560]   Engineers who can do this it might take them three months instead of three weeks, but it would get done
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:18.880]   I'm sure there would also be a problem of they would probably find a way of not necessarily giving them the first solution that they came across
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:24.800]   But they would probably have internally a list of requirements that here is the safest way that we can comply with this
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.440]   So even if apple Mctix all the supreme all the way the supreme court and loses
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:33.760]   They still have options so that they can still enforce their will
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.120]   Upon this and I don't think that that's a that's a bad thing at all
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:44.000]   and not to politicize a horrible horrific event that occurred last night in belgium and our hearts and
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:52.000]   Thoughts go out to everyone in belgium. It's just terrible terrible thing, but you also have to wonder if
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.280]   What the attitude towards all this would be in light of that, you know when there's a terrorist attack
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.320]   I think people then might back down a little bit on their adamant
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:05.280]   Defense of encryption if you know because they feel threatened
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:12.480]   It's a it's a complicated issue. Yep. We're gonna take a break when we come back. We finally will talk about the new iphone
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:18.400]   New iphone actually some details on the new ipad being revealed that maybe make may make me a hesitate
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.040]   Press in the buy button
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.560]   And uh, we'll talk about that in just a minute. Andy and Akos here
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   Not sure if jim dal rimple's gonna join us at this point. Uh, he was scheduled
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.600]   Contacted us the last minute so he was called into a meeting
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.560]   We were trying to get ahold of him to see if he will join us or not
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:39.680]   But certainly the lines are open jim no word yet and I have here a hundred dollar bill

[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.440]   iPhone se
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.960]   By the way
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.960]   kudos to mark german and the
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:17.200]   The rumor mongers because they got it all right. There was nothing they didn't get
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.880]   Was there? I don't think so even the prices were accurate. Yeah, I didn't miss anything. No
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.280]   I'm sorry. I didn't see anything of a must
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:31.120]   399 that might have been I think so I've seen some people say 450 for the iPhone seo 399 for the 16 gig
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:36.720]   Uh, there is uh, no 32 gig. They jump right to 64. That's the one you want obviously and
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.560]   Uh, what what is that one? Is that a hundred bucks more? I think it is 499
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.400]   Uh, it is an iPhone looks like an iPhone 5 they won't sell the i5 s anymore
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:52.960]   This is going to replace it as the small iPhone but not underpowered. It is a roughly a success, right?
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.040]   It's a success and everything but force touch and size
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:03.040]   Uh, it's got the same cpu. It's got the same it's got the same camera, which is a huge huge big win
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.480]   Yeah, uh, sorry the the the 12 megapixel main camera the the selfie camera is the
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.080]   Basically the same one as you got from the 5s, but okay, who cares about that?
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.720]   You still get 4k video you still get 12 megapixel sensors
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.840]   You still get the same quality of images that you're going to get from that
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.680]   Uh, it really and it's you get all the all the radios
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   You need to get all the all your health kit sort of stuff working there. You get the same
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.320]   Connectivity radios. You get the same
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:35.520]   Touch id you get the same apple pay it really is they didn't want to i think apple definitely when they were designing this they didn't want them
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.000]   To create a second class phone
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.560]   So any product any service any accessory that is of current for the for the success is going to work perfectly fine
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.680]   On the new se is it a big deal. There's no 3d touch
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.720]   I don't think so there
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:59.120]   I i'm a big fan of 3d touch, but apple still needs to sell the point of here's why 3d touch is more important than simply press and hold
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.440]   There is a bunch of stuff that will i think that uh, i was looking at there with some of the rundowns
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:08.800]   Obviously i haven't hold i haven't held out the the se yet, but uh, for instance of
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:16.640]   A kak i keep forgetting what they call the pictures that move what what what's the bs name? They came over that
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.120]   the the live photos there it is on live photos on the
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:28.480]   Success you get you make the pictures move by by using force touch on the se you just touch and hold and you will get the animation right?
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.320]   Right, so it's i i don't i don't think that's a big deal
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.120]   It might be a big deal next year when more developers start thinking about it in terms of
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:41.600]   Something intrinsic to the interface as opposed to just here's alternative to touch and hold
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:47.920]   But it really this sensation i love the price point i love that the 16 gig version is 399 bucks
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:54.960]   Because by the way, we don't normally recommend 16 gigs, but i think that for the audiences is for that might not be a bad choice
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:00.560]   Right if you're if you're using you know, if you're buying a four inch phone, you're not loading it up with a lot of content
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.800]   also apple is
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.080]   apple is
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:09.600]   Making the point that well you've got apple music why would you want to keep have four or five gigabytes of music on there
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.680]   Uh, it is a compact phone for people who don't have big screen needs for it
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:20.400]   Uh, the fact that it's uh, the the battery life is going to be superb. I'm actually considering buying one just as a camera
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:26.000]   I've been sort of navigating this idea because i love the kit i love the camera on my uh, nexus 5x
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.840]   But it's not the same speed it's not doesn't have the same software
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:35.520]   Yeah, and i was actually considering well if i had a budget of 400 dollars just to buy like a standalone pocket camera
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:41.120]   What would it be and i was like, well, I don't want to just buy an iphone if you want a mobile camera always on
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:44.720]   Exactly, so it's exactly the same as in the as in the success
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.600]   As i understand it to be as exactly the same as the success not the success plus it doesn't have
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:55.040]   Uh, opposition. Yeah, but supposedly it will take the exact it has the same flash i believe
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:02.080]   Uh, it doesn't have the same front facing uh, selfie flash because that requires a special uh, special screen to make that happen
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:05.040]   Uh, but it really they said it didn't have written a flash
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:10.960]   Yeah, it does have the retina has written a flash. Yeah, that's a dobe flash. I mean, it's just the screen gets really bright
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.080]   Three times brighter than normal, but it's better but it's better than nothing
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.960]   It's a flash. I mean it's a front facing flash
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:23.920]   Uh, i'm glad i'm glad that apple didn't just think well if we can't do this perfectly with like three camera hairlight backlight
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:28.560]   We're not gonna do it. It's like, well, okay, we can add we can add a different display technology to overdrive it
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.080]   So, okay, why not?
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:34.720]   There's so many that there's a very tim cook decision. I think it's an interesting what you say is interesting though
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.840]   Because admittedly, you know, I mean you could for 400 bucks
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.160]   You probably could get a better camera with zoom and stuff, but you wouldn't get always connected
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.680]   You wouldn't get the software choices all the different apps
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:49.840]   Uh, that yeah, I mean there's so many interesting apps available on the iphone
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.320]   You also you also wouldn't get a
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.720]   Camera that has a battery that will simply last and last and last if you're not using it
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.960]   That's a good point. Yeah, that was something when I was looking at the idea of buying like a sony
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:07.600]   RX 100 mark two which you can get for about 500 bucks one of my difficulties was I want to have a camera that can simply have in my pocket
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:11.120]   And even if I don't use it for three or four days or five days, I'll still have some battery in there
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:16.560]   So I'm I'm insist I know that this is an edge case sort of thing, but that's a really attractive price
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.080]   They didn't it doesn't look like they cut this down at all
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:25.200]   They just they it seems like they just explicitly said there's some people who would like to have an iphone
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.000]   But they don't want to have a large screen larger screen phone
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.240]   They need something more compact and so we're selling it to you and if it also allows us to compete with
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:39.120]   Uh some of the exceptional android phones that are out there that cost between 250 and 450 dollars all the better
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.440]   One of the things apple said is that they sold what it was at 30 million
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:50.160]   Four inch phones last year. So it's a big market still and I have to think that internationally
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:56.000]   It's going to be a big market apple's never made a cheap phone, but I think by being able to sell a 400 dollar
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:02.640]   Good iphone with a small screen there may be a that may be a massive market and that's what apple's looking for right now
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.880]   They know they're they've reached peak iphone. There was only 1% growth last quarter
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:11.680]   Uh, and so they're I think they don't expect the next big thing
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:17.920]   But what they'd like to do is keep whittling away at the market. So yeah 30 million four inch iphone so
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.800]   As usual I wish I wish they broke that down by country
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.240]   Uh because there are countries that a lot more price sensitive
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:29.840]   So are they do they really want four inch phones or do they want to phone the cost less than 600 dollars is the is the big question
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.240]   Um also they they
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:37.680]   They I think that they've even acknowledged that the key to growth is to try to sell the iphone in places where they haven't been selling
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.520]   Very much very many of them. So it's not as though they're saying well here's where all the bacon is coming from
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.400]   So let's keep selling let's keep shipping hogs to those countries
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.040]   They are they have really do have their eyes on india
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:52.480]   They've been speaking about the indian market the same way that they would coily speak about where the wearables market
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:58.160]   A year and a half ago two years ago, you know the same the sort of language that says that we definitely have plans to address that
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.560]   But of course we're not going to talk about it until we actually ship something
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:08.000]   So, uh, this isn't cheap enough to really get into that market, but it's a step in the right direction certainly apple has not been super forthcoming about
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:14.160]   Um, what's going on for instance somebody in the chat room is saying that the radio is not lte advanced
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.280]   There's no barometer no tactic engine maimo
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.440]   We won't really know all of that. I think until I fix it tears it down and we we know what chips are in there and all of that because
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.800]   And here's a bit of a shocker that came out
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:32.240]   Today that may be may set me back a little bit on the new ipad pro in every respect
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:37.920]   I love the idea of a 9.7 inch ipad pro. I you know, I'll have to see that keyboard, but
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.240]   Um, I really like that. I think that that's portable. It's
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.360]   The way that the giant ipad pro isn't
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.920]   Um, however, according to a number of sources including nine to five mac and matthew panzerino tech crunch
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:57.520]   The new ipad pro will have half or a only two gigs of ram. What is that? I guess
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:00.160]   uh 50 less ram
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.840]   And a slightly slower cpu and they're getting that information from geek bench
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.920]   stats
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.440]   So some people have been running I guess pre-release versions
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:17.200]   Of the ipad pro apple implied that the a 9x processor in the 9.7 inch pro
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:21.120]   Um would be everybody's capable as its big brother
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:25.360]   But half actually is half the ram the ipad pro has four gigs
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:32.720]   Uh and a slightly slower processor. That's a little discouraging. I I hate to see them cut the ram in half more than the processor speed
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:39.040]   That would be a big deal. I haven't seen I haven't seen confirmation of that yet. I have my usual
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.600]   Uh, haven't had my conversations with apple yet
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.360]   Um, and that's something on the list. I have so I can't comment on that. I don't know
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:50.640]   Um, this is benjamin mayo running writing in a nine to five mac
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:54.640]   Um, and he says it appears so
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.560]   Uh, we'll just have to see and it it comes from the geek bench
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:04.960]   Stuff so that's public. Well, it's but that may not be the actual that may be prototypes that may not be the actual
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:09.280]   It might it might be prototypes and it's also possible that geek bench is not set up to it
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.920]   It's possible that the the new ipad is doing something different that geek bench is not set up to see
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:21.920]   I it's it's an interesting data point as my uh friend mega core the wonderful science writer says when she comes across an interesting
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:28.160]   People science news interesting if true, uh, which is not that I doubt it, but it's i'm gonna know that's fair though because we
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:32.880]   We don't know and apple doesn't seem to say they never say how much ram
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:37.600]   Or clock speeds or anything like that that you say it's an a nine x with the motion. I'm sure
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.480]   Yeah, I'd be I'd just be a little bit surprised if they
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:47.360]   Bother to create a different to put a different cpu in there when they can just simply keep that pipeline of nine x chips running
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.480]   Uh, and why would they want to really complicate things?
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.920]   I'm sure that if they did put a different cpu in there
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:58.960]   I'm sure that if they did put less ram in there there would be a very specific reason why they chose to do that
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:02.880]   And I don't think would have to do with saving money. I think that there would be a tent
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.400]   My guess would be there would be a technical issue that caused me to do that
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:11.520]   But as I said, I don't believe it until I actually see really good confirmation there. They are gonna up
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.680]   uh the storage
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:17.280]   Excuse there's gonna be a new one with 256 gigs
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.280]   Yep of storage. I thought 128 was a lot
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:27.760]   Well, I thought I thought 120 was a lot until I filled it. Yeah, I feel mine too. Isn't that funny? I did too. Yeah
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.880]   And fortunately, that's one feature that's coming to the
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.840]   To the 12.9 inch ipad pro as well
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:38.480]   Uh, because that that was the one there are a couple of things that I was oh too bad
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:43.840]   Uh, but uh to the extra given that this is such a an imbal device
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:49.920]   For real productivity the ability to have as much 4k to have lots of 4k video on there to have any
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.840]   To have all of your music library on there. Uh, that's that's a pretty big deal
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.840]   I have to say
[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.080]   Now that I think about it going from four to gigs of ram to two seems unlikely
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:05.760]   We were complaining that many pro apps would struggle with four gigs of ram and yeah
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.680]   That's really what the pro is for is these 3d apps and things like that
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.040]   Yeah, and also given that this is apple pencil compatible
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.880]   Uh, it doesn't take an immense amount of ram to support the apple pencil
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:23.440]   But you're now supporting a bunch of apps that now are going to be very very very storage of excuse me memory intensive
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.920]   Uh, I would
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:34.960]   It's a date. It's a data point and there's a question. Okay. Let's see here because uh apple does apparently reveal this in
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:40.240]   Their comparison. I'm looking at the comparison right now. Um
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:47.120]   By the way, this y yammit color and true tone display is unique to the smaller ipad pro
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.440]   Um
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.680]   Processor is a little bit slower. They say
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.200]   Uh 2.4 times faster instead of 2.5 times faster
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.960]   Yeah, but the camera is a little different too. Although I'm really gratified
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.760]   It's different
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.960]   They decided to put a 12 megapixel camera in there that that is as far as I can tell close to the iphone camera, right?
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.240]   Yeah, it's it's not just uh, I don't know that's the exact same camera
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.280]   But it says a lot of the same specs 12 megapixels plus 4k video recording at 30 frames per second
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.080]   I mean, that's what you want an ipad that is a great. I don't want people to shoot
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.320]   Photos at concerts, but it's a great video camera. Alex lindry said, you know, I can see if it had 4k
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.240]   And it's a nice viewfinder. Maybe we start mounting those around the studio and staring right?
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:35.120]   We we keep thinking about uh, these cameras as tourists in the magic kingdom taking stupid pictures with their view cameras
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:41.200]   But this is the ipad is one hell of a platform in the professional video community for field recording and field reporter
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.160]   It's not it's not an accident that you can spend three or four or five hundred dollars for a really complicated
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.760]   uh, milled aluminum rig that turns it into sort of a shoulder mounted
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.520]   uh, handicam they they
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.720]   Shooters love the big screen. They also love the fact that they they don't have to transfer anything to anything
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.320]   They could simply edit 4k video right there and then distribute it right from that device. It really is an all-in-one sort of thing
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:08.000]   Um, you go you go through this list though and you kind of wonder how many of these features particularly that new
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.320]   That new color system display
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.800]   How much of that was supposed to go into the 12.9?
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.680]   But for whatever reason had to be struck off to make a ship date wasn't ready yet, huh?
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:23.120]   Yeah, uh, you know, they do confirm in the specs the slightly and I mean slightly slower
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.760]   CPU speed probably not something significant
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:31.840]   They never anywhere talk about how much ram as far as I remember they've very they never talk about how much ram is any device
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.840]   It's it's gotta be realized if you scroll down to the the specs on chip
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.960]   There is one entry that spans both columns a 9x so the a 9x chip with 64 bit architecture and the m9 coprocess
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:46.960]   Or that could mean that they are striking a second flavor of a 9x
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.200]   Uh, that's better. They're under clocking it. They may merely be under clocking
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:56.400]   Or I was gonna say or there are other hardware limitation that says that we got to slow this down a little bit just to make sure it's a smaller battery
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.800]   Maybe they want to get battery life up. There's there could be lots of reasons why you'd under clocking
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.400]   It's like they haven't they haven't saying they didn't say in the specs, but I did
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:10.480]   Uh, I they have told other people at the event that it will have the same battery life as the ipad pro
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.560]   So there could be a lot of things that they had it's fine tuned in order to give it the same spec
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:19.840]   That's become the expectation 10 hours. That's just like yeah, that's I mean that that's enough for laptops for tablets
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.760]   There's not a whole lot of ambition to correct the 16-hour barrier
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:30.320]   Boy, I really want to know about this ram. We'll continue to pursue that interesting. They added an ethernet dongle though. Isn't it?
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:38.400]   Yeah, that's interesting as as matter of fact the the entire all the entire description of the new uh, camera connected
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.720]   The new camera connection kit
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:47.760]   Sounds good. Not only is it usb 3.0, but I can't remember if they'd ever in the description for this product
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.200]   Actually acknowledged things like ethernet connectivity on this device
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.120]   Uh external hubs they vote there's it's been an open secret way to do it. Oh, yeah
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:05.040]   I'm sorry. It supports hubs. I've uh the last time I tried to get ethernet working with it
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.480]   I couldn't get it to work. You need a driver. I think so you need a driver
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.200]   It's it's not it's not plug and play but this is the first time they've actually mentioned ethernet so perhaps
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.280]   Uh, I I have not tried it out yet because I don't have the new the new dongle yet
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:24.000]   Uh, but if it's there in black and white then it's either already baked into 9.3 or it's something's going to be coming very very shortly
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.080]   Yeah, yeah new pro also has twice the LTE speeds according to the uh specs
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:34.160]   Twice so when does have lte advanced the big one does not have lte advanced all right there you go
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.000]   Of course, good luck finding LTE advanced, but
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.320]   There are places it's rolling out slowly and that's future proofing because in a year or two. It'll be everywhere
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:48.880]   Yeah, that was that was another really cool thing about I wish I could quote it directly
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.880]   But uh, I think it was tim that was talking about
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:58.000]   Trying not trying to encourage people to necessarily have to replace their phones before they really need to replace their phones
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   To make it easier for people to hold on to a phone
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.520]   Uh for a couple of years, uh, and so it's good to see uh
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.440]   A feature in this new iPad that really won't be relevant for most people for another year year and a half at least
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.000]   So that's a bully to them for doing that
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.800]   So we didn't know really how much ram the ipad pro had in it for a long time
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.960]   Uh, you know apple finally came stepped forward and said it has four gigs
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.600]   um
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.960]   I'm gonna call shenanigans. Uh, i'm gonna i'm gonna wait matthew panzerino apparently
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.800]   Um
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:37.040]   Is breaking embargo and has an ipad the new ipad pro on hand and used a memory checking app to check the ram
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:44.320]   Um, if he's revealing it now he's certainly breaking embargo because nobody's got no about that. Well, I don't know where i mean
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:49.600]   What is if he has an ipad pro small we need a name for this thing by the way. Yeah
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.480]   They did it to us again. I
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.520]   Even to even today talking to friends about the new the the 2015 macbook. I had to
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.760]   I had to specify was the macbook nothing
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:04.320]   Uh, although you also you also noticed that the not a good name by the way
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.600]   But the new iphone is the iphone se they're not putting a number next to it
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.640]   To try to remove some of the stigma of smart
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:16.320]   Yeah, exactly so now they can simply say that we have the just like they they dropped the iphone two iphone three iphone
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:20.320]   Excuse me ipad two three four it is simply the ipad and if you want to get technical about it
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.320]   You have a third or fourth or fifth generation ipad
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:28.960]   It does make things more complicated, but you can now we're just going to train ourselves to say 9.7 inch ipad pro
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:36.000]   I wish apple were more forthcoming. I guess they really want to get away from the kind of speeds and feeds kind of geekage
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.320]   But yeah, there are those of us who are that geek and want to know and uh, and it's that would make
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.520]   I think having the ram would make a significant difference. I believe yeah
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.920]   Well, this thing's only been public for a day. Yeah, so there's still plenty of time to to talk well
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.000]   I hope they respond to uh to matthew
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.560]   And people these first generation reviews are going to have to talk about the performance of this thing next to the next the 12.9
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:02.480]   And that's what's really going to matter. No, no one cares if a cpu has been underclock
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.920]   No one cares about uh about the ram architecture under the hood
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   All they care about is when they draw a line with the pencil. Does it is it a nice curve or there are breaks or there breaks in it
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:16.320]   And when they try to take a sequence of photos does it die after
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.800]   43 photos or does it die after 400 photos? That's what people care about
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.400]   And serena is also saying that the iphone se is
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.520]   Is hot runs hot. We'll see about that too
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.880]   Uh, you don't have as much uh real estate to uh
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:37.200]   Get that heat off but also it looks like um for all intents and purposes
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.080]   It really does look like they recycled the
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:48.800]   It has the visual effect of the existing five uh iphone five. It doesn't look like they created they reinvented the case
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.160]   Um, i'm sure they would not have shipped something that is not capable
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.560]   But I wonder if uh
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:59.280]   They didn't decide to spend a lot of time say well if it's a little bit warm, that's okay
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.040]   Whereas if they were designing a case from the ground up, especially for this
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.120]   They would make sure that there's uh heat dissipation and uh next sort of stuff
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:13.040]   Right, but who knows? We're we're going from somebody who said this one thing. I yeah, I certainly haven't touched a nse yet
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.880]   So yep, uh speaking of the macbook nothing disappointing
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.200]   Uh that they didn't make any announcements about uh skylake or new macbooks
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.800]   Not really, uh, I I would expect that in may or ww dc
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.720]   Uh, the traditionally they really haven't had really big event event sort of stuff for the notebooks
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.080]   They've they've it seems as though they treat those as commodity devices
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.440]   Uh, and they will they're oftentimes they're perfectly happy even with a significant speed bump to simply
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.080]   Uh release a press release and not even have not even tack it onto another event. Yeah
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:52.000]   It's gonna be interesting to see what they do with the macbook nothing though. I I think that will see a speed bump
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.760]   I think we'll see a second usb port. Uh, I don't think we'll see much of anything else though
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.240]   Any other thoughts on the uh apple event?
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:04.000]   Have we covered everything? I think we have um well, we didn't talk about the watches. Uh, oh no bans whoo
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.040]   Which of course meant launched rene richy and serenity call will into a buying
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.440]   frenzy at the apple store
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:17.280]   I really I really wish that this is where I wish either of them had google glass because was there actually a stampede
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:23.040]   from like the from town hall to the apple store because people trying to get their hands on product first
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:29.360]   Um, but that it is it is actually cool because now you have like a cajillion different bans designs
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:34.720]   Also, these are 50 dollar bans so they're uh, they're the same price as the sport bans only
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.040]   They don't look like you're wearing a rubber. I like that
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.080]   I have to say i'm happy about that because that that at 50 bucks
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.880]   I would love to have one of these nylon bands as they're there
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.120]   It's significantly their price about the same price as uh third party bans
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.360]   Uh, which is something that apple
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.040]   I don't know if they're they they might want to pay some attention to because I keep buying
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.840]   I kept buying third party bans for my apple watch and not noticing a hell of a lot of difference before
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.760]   Yeah, I bought one of the cheap red red leather bans about 20 bucks. It fell apart
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:07.680]   So, uh, I bought the millenies loop and I wore it every day for like two or three months and
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:12.880]   We're work fine for me. Uh, but i'm glad that i'm glad that they're making things
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.000]   For people who don't have a lot of money and speaking of that they did cut the prices on the sport model by 50 bucks
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.200]   Yes, really, which is a really important step because now it's more and it's more in the line of what people are
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.120]   Have been paying for smart watches these days. I think apple
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:33.840]   I do like to see parallels between this and how apple cut the price of the original iphone when they realized that
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.800]   Okay, people are not reacting to this as something that's worth a cajillion dollar premium
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.040]   Of that they did cut the price down to make it a little bit more competitive with android rare watches to make it more competitive
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.920]   Uh with the of super fitness bans
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.520]   Uh that are out there like the kind of the kind that president obama wears
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.720]   Uh 200 to 300 dollars is roughly what people seem to be comfortable spending for these things
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   And now that the minimum buy-in is 50 dollars less that really puts it closer to that
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.720]   Yeah, he wears a fitbit surge, which is the most expensive fitbit
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:10.320]   Out there. I think that's 250 bucks. Yeah, so it's it's in that it's in that ballpark. You know now
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.640]   Yeah, it's it's hard. I mean it's hard this you've seen this on the show a million times
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.840]   360
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:21.600]   Yeah, this is this is the new modo 360 and you really can't make the you really can't make the case that well if this only costs
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.880]   270 dollars, but oh what a piece of crap this is this doesn't look like a watch or piece of snow
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.160]   It's actually looks like a very nice watch the much I like it with a leather band
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:36.480]   Uh, so I think that's a that's a copter reality or for all we know they have just figured out a way to streamline the
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:40.320]   The manufacturing process or they're not they their
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.400]   Process is has improved to the point where they no longer have to throw away
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.600]   Or recycle as many of these things they're getting a better yield
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.800]   So but I think I'd like to think they've been feeling a little bit of pressure
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:57.840]   So many of the chairman says if you wait and you shop around there are sales on apple watches best by was selling them for 150 bucks last week
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.080]   So that's another thing to keep in mind you can you can get a better deal
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.120]   uh one one more uh sad story
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:13.600]   Uh, and he grove has passed away and I'm sure you had talked to andy and I had and uh, he was the uh chairman and uh,
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:21.040]   CEO of intel for many years really uh, kind of the man who ushered intel into the uh, wind tell era
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.280]   he was uh
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:30.720]   Add Intel's founding in 1968 with bob noisin gordon more became president in 1979 ceo in 1987
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:37.600]   chairman of the board from 97 to 2005 his story was amazing. He was a student in hungry
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.560]   during the 1956
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.160]   uprising
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.920]   And uh, when the soviet tanks moved in to shut down
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:52.320]   The movement in hungry. He was so disturbed by this. He was a study study in chemistry
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:58.560]   He was so disturbed by this he and I remember he told he told me this he he escaped to austria by crawling
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:05.760]   uh, under barbed wire fences and crawling through fields. He I mean this was like a very risky process
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.240]   but managed to
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.880]   Make it to new york city where he studied chemical engineering at the uh, city college of new york
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:17.600]   I got his phd at cal in 1963 and went to work at fairchild
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:24.800]   with gordon more as a researcher and assistant head of rnd and uh, he was a gentleman
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.280]   He was a really a brilliant businessman
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:34.160]   And one of the things that distinguished him is he uh, he didn't wear a necktie and he refused to have an office
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.600]   He had a cubicle
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.320]   uh, even when he was a ceo of intel at a cubicle along with the other guys
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.920]   And uh, and really was a great man. I think I
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:51.440]   Wasn't like that that wasn't like the uh, all here at here at amazon all of our desks are just doors on top of filing cabinets
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:54.320]   That wasn't pr. That was really a character sort of issue
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:01.680]   And that's unfortunate we sometimes in the entertainment news you talk about how all the old movie stars are no longer with us
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.520]   And so it's really exciting when you get to see surely mcclean on on the cobear show
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.240]   And a lot of these people that are just
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.040]   Titans in this industry
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.200]   Uh that founded companies that didn't just become successful
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:22.480]   But allowed other companies to become successful and they they got that way through the vision and through the
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.680]   Really through through the principles of a couple of very very
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:35.280]   Important people and any grove is one of those people were really starting to lose that sort of brain trust that generation. Yeah, yeah
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.520]   he
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:44.320]   I interviewed him when we when I was at tech tv. I remember going to intel and sitting down and having a really great long interview
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.640]   Uh with him
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.800]   And I remember how angry he was at microsoft at the time of course
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:59.360]   This was during the heyday of the windtail partnership where all pcs ran intel chips before amd started to eat away at some of their market share and
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:06.080]   Uh, and but they were very dependent on microsoft and he was always mad that he or we are we're making 32 bit chips
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.400]   He said and and bill gates refused to make a 32 bit operating system
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.560]   It was it always a great tim, but he was a great guy and very forthright
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.480]   You know, you normally I don't interview ceos because you're never going to get them to say anything interesting
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.840]   Andy always had something interesting to say he was a great guy
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.440]   And uh, he will be missed and he grove passed away at the age of uh 79 former
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.240]   ceo and chairman of intel. We're going to take a break
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.680]   Uh, do you want to do a pic of the week? Sure. I got one
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:39.040]   I got one, uh, and then i'm running out of here because I got a flat in new york city and lisa's going
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.520]   wrap wrap
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.880]   wrap
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.160]   Well, i'm worried because after the horror in belgium i have a feeling that security is going to be pretty tight at the airport
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.720]   So we want to get out of here a little bit earlier than we had planned
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.160]   Our show brought today brought to you by ad lassian
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:03.440]   What a great support for everything we do here we used at lassian jira in the uh, design of our new website the team in austin
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.200]   Uh, we here we would create user stories get them up in jira
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:14.720]   They would go through the the process the agile process and it was it was a great way to stay on top of exactly what was happening
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.800]   As it went through sprints. It was such a great tool. I just loved jira and as a result we started using hip chat
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:27.760]   Hip chat, uh, is um instant messaging video chat, but really what it's all about is keeping everybody on the same page
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.840]   And now we use it throughout the organization. We have
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.520]   Sales hip chats. We have engineering hip chat. I just created a hip chat for products that are in house
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.840]   So that all of the hosts know what's in house what what we have what we can review and what we need to get
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:45.200]   Because that's because megan came to me yesterday and said, uh, well, what do we can do about the new ipads?
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.840]   And I said let's create a hip chat and we can we can all get on the same page because we have hosts all over
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:53.600]   Uh, hip chat also has something called confluence
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.480]   Which lets you create and share content organized results bring team members up to speed
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:01.680]   We use confluence to keep track of it issues
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.320]   So we are all in on it lassian
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:10.960]   The only thing we haven't used yet is bitbucket for testing reviewing and managing code in real time and for all I know patrick's using that too
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.760]   I I know if you're a coder if you are a manager if you have products
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:20.400]   That you're moving the market you know about at lassian. I want you to try it if you haven't tried it yet
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.120]   This is how you bring everyone together to build what's next
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:29.680]   And it is being used in so many enterprises all over the world
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.640]   I want you to try it go to at lassian at lassian
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:40.320]   S i a n 2 s is at lassian.com to learn more and see how jira and confluence and hip chat and bitbucket
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:45.840]   Can give your team everything you need to organize discuss and complete shared work
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:53.440]   I can't I can't speak more highly of it. It is it is a boon. It has been a boon to us at lassian.com
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.480]   Unleash the potential in your team
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:59.280]   And build what's next?
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:04.960]   I guess no jim dalrymple i'm very disappointed. We'll get him on on a future show rene will be back next week
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:07.040]   uh, you know
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.480]   It probably means that he'll have a lot of nice things to talk about next week if we have him on
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:16.480]   We will or or at least we'll make him feel very very awkward when he has to well. I don't know I can't we talk about
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:22.480]   Yeah, I think that's probably the meeting he was called into on data leaves with a fruit company somewhere in the south bay
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.200]   Uh, i'm almost certain that's what happened and of course if apple calls you're not gonna say well
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.680]   I gotta do this back break weekly show. Okay. It could have been googled wanted to bring him over to google music
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:36.800]   I think he's already there, isn't he? We will treat we will treat your black Sabbath with love
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.480]   We will leave your album art alone jim
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.760]   What's your pick of the week mr. Naidko
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:49.760]   Uh lately i've been giving a really deep uh shakedown to adobe lightroom particularly the mobile apps
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.200]   um
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.360]   I was really really confused by them a couple of months ago because there's like a million apps and they
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.120]   Unfortunately, if you've been using an ipad for a while or iPhone for well
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.360]   You have to have you now have eight or nine different adobe apps and some of them do things that overlap
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:07.120]   So I decided I had a long conversation with uh, they're headed digital
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:12.560]   And after that said okay, I'll give it. I'll give this a try and boy am I becoming a really big fan of it
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:19.040]   It's uh, you have to obviously it's a big deal if you're using lightroom as your photo organizer on the desktop
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.920]   I had to switch to lightroom because uh aperture is now a dead product. It's not a dead parrot
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.600]   Uh, but I haven't really used the mobile apps. It's really great
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.920]   Because you can sync uh collections to uh to an adobe cloud
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.160]   You can make really fine tuned adjustments to it on your ipad
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.360]   I'm using a lot of my ipad pro and then all of those adjustments sync back to your main library
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.000]   And it's uh much more fine tuned than what you get using the photos app
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.400]   With the apple photos
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.280]   It's not just okay. Make this a little bit brighter. Make this a little bit darker
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.640]   I can really do about 80 to 90 of the stuff that I would do
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.320]   Uh to fix or improve a photo uh right there on the ipad
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.640]   And it's not that's and it will be effect
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:04.000]   It will affect like the raw files that i've got uh on my libraries back home
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.400]   Uh, because when you are sucking stuff down from the cloud it only takes down the stuff that
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.720]   Parts the image that uh the depth the image that it feels that it actually needs to show you
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:19.920]   That's really really accurate the other part that i've been really liking because I didn't realize until I went deep dive on this that the lightroom mobile app
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:24.560]   Has a camera function as well. This is brand new. This is just they just released that
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:28.160]   Fairly new I did it wasn't until I went through it again. Um
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:32.800]   And so you can capture images directly into lightroom and then use these
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:39.200]   Really tight integrated tools in order to improve them and also to flag them so that when they go back
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.400]   When they get sucked back down to your lightroom library, they're already in a library. They're already flagged. They're already been starred
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.760]   Uh, and the only thing that I wish it could do is
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.160]   Unfortunately when you're using it on ios
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.360]   Uh, ios doesn't give lightroom access to raw data from the imager
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.240]   So you're still modifying jpgs, but what you can do with this? It's a lot more
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.520]   It's it's you a lot more control than what you could do
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.520]   With with photos. I think and if I know
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.160]   You look this is for apple this is for everybody
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:14.160]   There's some of us that have iPads and have max but also have android phones
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.360]   If you have an android phone, you can actually get shoot in raw
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.840]   It was short it will store as a dng file
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:25.840]   And the amount of detail the amount of color and the light information you can get through that is just phenomenal
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:30.720]   I shot a photo of uh, the of the uh, ansel adam's view from tunnel view
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:36.000]   Uh on at your sanity. That's that's what that was shot with the nexus 5x
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.560]   What? In light mobile that's stunning. I made some adjustments on the phone
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.440]   Uh, and then when I got back to my hotel room
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.760]   It got synced down to the desktop and I made a few adjustments in the desktop version of it
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:51.840]   I shot this same photo with five different all five cameras that I had on me
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.800]   And honestly, yes, the one that I shot with the olympus omd
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.040]   Is is better
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:03.120]   But you really have to pixel peep to realize that okay, so rest the olympus
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.680]   There's no noise whatsoever in the sky
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.200]   Uh, you have to zoom really close to see the 5x noise
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:15.040]   The tonality is there that was not shot as an hdr image at all. That was just one shot. That's remarkable
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.800]   That's a 5x
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.800]   That and that is a that is a mid priced phone. That is priced like the iphone
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.400]   We gotta get you an s7 and you would just flip your lid
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:30.160]   I I'm still I'm still hesitant about making a sam song phones my daily carry they put so much junk on it
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:34.160]   But I really do encourage if you're serious about photography at all
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.960]   It's you can use it for free and it gives you most of the features
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.520]   if you are if you are
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:46.240]   A subscriber to their photo package where you get photoshop and lightroom on the desktop
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:50.080]   You get a lot more storage you get syncing through
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:57.200]   Across devices just the ability to there are different times where I've been taking like my 45 minute hour long train into the city
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:03.760]   And because I came home from Yosemite. I've got five 600 photos that I just off off my memory card
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.360]   I put into my desktop
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:10.320]   Because now those are synced into the clouds now i'm on the train for an hour doing nothing but reject
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.560]   Except four stars three stars accept reject. Ooh, what if I crop it that way?
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:18.320]   It's amazing by the time I get yeah by the time I get back home again from the return trip
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.440]   All of this stuff that would have taken me a lot of time to get done at home just for fun doing it on the train
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.480]   So i'm a really big fan of it and also it's a free app
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:32.320]   whether you pay for the $10 a month photo package or not, but this is the sort of thing that
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.520]   Gets you thinking about
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:42.320]   Using your phone as a real camera and really thinking about it as a real camera because with tools like this you have so fewer limitations
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:48.160]   It's actually the main reason I want to get the new ipad pro is for lightroom on the ipad
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:53.680]   And adobe mix they they now have almost a dozen apps they're
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:58.960]   Super they're super aggressive supporting all the new features. It does it doesn't just work the slide
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.920]   Slide over you can also use side-by-side view. It's it works with apple pencil
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:10.400]   You can you can throw it from the lightroom app into a reed adobe photoshop retouch
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.960]   So now you can remove like spots on windows and and specs that are on the lens
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.080]   Uh, i'm really excited about uh about what it what it can do with this we had Russell
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.560]   We had Russell brown on
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.520]   Trangulation a few weeks ago and he was talking about using the ipad pro with the new adobe mobile apps and
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:33.120]   He even said, you know, I use the desktop app less and less because they sync though you can you don't lose anything
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:41.440]   Which is great also it's it's so freaky and wonderful to be especially the ipad the 13-ish ipad pro to be looking at like a full
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.080]   Beautiful eight and a half by 11 8 8 by 10 print of your picture
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:53.280]   I know and you can be it's just it's I sometimes but my photos may or may not be very good
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.840]   But it's just stunning to see them at full size
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.080]   Especially when you're just trying to triage 300
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.400]   Photos down to the 50 or 60 that are worth your further attention
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.280]   Because they're things you're never going to get from a thumbnail
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:10.640]   That just blow you you just see so much so much potential when you get to see it on this 12.9 inch screen
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.600]   And I bet the same will be true of the 9.7 inch ipad pro as well
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:16.880]   Well, it's hard to take a bad picture of half dome, but I think that
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:23.440]   Amazing is really I will say I will say that that that's the sort of view where if you're if you're standing right there
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:27.120]   At that time of day and that kind of weather and you man it all you have to do is
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:32.080]   Aim your phone at the right for the correct side of the planet and you will get a really good picture
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:38.660]   But there is a difference between what you can get with like instagram versus what you get with the right light room on
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.600]   Yes, it's it's really turned to be into a regular that I think apple could use that as wallpaper
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.080]   Exactly. Oh
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.800]   I'll wave whatever
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:53.200]   Conflict of interest stuff if I could be part of the shop with iphone program. He's first off to go
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.440]   I'll take pull my iphone six a copy of that photo. Oh, yeah, that wasn't a shot
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:03.760]   Well, that was most of a shot with life were mobile, but I would have gotten the same results with it. I think
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:10.080]   I am going to go a little geeky on you for my pick of the week. I mentioned before hacker news hacker news to me
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.720]   Is product hunt for geeks?
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:17.200]   It's gone through ups and downs people were trying to game it for a while and i'm just a huge fan
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:22.160]   It's why combinators newsfeed and every time I go to hacker news and I go there several times a day
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:25.360]   There's something new and just weirdly geeky
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:30.320]   Um somebody's written a javascript autocomplete from stack overflow
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.320]   So you no longer have to copy and paste code from stack overflow to actually just fill them in
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.560]   Uh, which uh, that was fun
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:41.760]   But the the thing I found that I really like is called transfer.sh. This is from a
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.640]   A group of coders in Utrecht
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:49.840]   Uh, the Netherlands they call themselves Dutch coders. They write really interesting stuff, but this one's awesome
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:55.280]   Now it's a command line utility that allows you to share files from the command line
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.000]   They're offering free storage for files up to 10 gigabytes
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.160]   You can upload it you'll get a unique url that you can share with anybody and the file stays there for two
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.680]   weeks
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.560]   Transfer.sh but even better now I like command line utilities, but even better
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.640]   You can they give you a little script you can add to your bash profile
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:20.720]   So you can let me just see what I have on my my drive here. Uh, let's do i'm going to transfer
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:26.080]   I'll show you i've made a script now that has the transfer command transfer my bash
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.600]   Dot r dot bash rc file
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.600]   whoops
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.440]   What have I done? I'd stopped working so I'll have to uh, off to source my uh
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:41.920]   Bash rc again. I don't know what happened there, but it's awesome. I mean, oh, I'm such a bad typist
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.920]   Maybe that's part of the problem command line
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.600]   Uh, but it's awesome because it uploads it
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:52.960]   Gives you a unique url you can share that url all of this is for free
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.880]   And they even give you source code on github if you want and i'm going to run this
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.440]   I'm going to put this on my own server and i'll have my own
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.480]   very easy to use file transfer if you take the
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:08.960]   The url that you use from transfer dot s h and you paste it into your browser by the way, it's all htts
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.840]   Nobody has to log in they just you can show the screen

[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:22.640]   What a cool little tool. Thank you dutch coders it's been around for a year, but um, I just saw it on hacronews
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.640]   So a couple of tips for you
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.320]   But now it is time for me to hide the to the airport
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.880]   Any knockouts but kind of fun. I don't think we've ever done a show just you and me it's so much fun
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.120]   It's too bad. I wasn't in studio. We could do like the dick cavity show like the two chairs
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:43.280]   And it feels like this and the big ashtray between us. Uh, yeah, i'll take up smoking for just for that occasion
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:48.080]   That's for that effect. We'll do digitally. We'll get some cigars. Yeah. Hey, it's really great to have you on any knockout course
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:52.800]   Rice for the chicago sun times is fabulous. Is it not cosaminac is on five by five?
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:56.000]   Um, you have other podcasts, so too, let's give them a plug
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:02.160]   Uh the material podcast on relay.fm, which is all about, uh, google issues
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.480]   Uh, and i'm here there and everywhere on the incomparable network with uh, Jason snell
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.520]   We're doing we're recording two episodes of the new hamilton podcast
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:17.440]   What wait you're doing a hamilton podcast the incomparable is doing every single track of of the two cd hamilton sound track
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:22.000]   Uh one half hour one episode one song per episode and it's not just me
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.320]   It's we got like about a dozen and a half people
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:29.120]   Uh, and now that now that you will have seen it perhaps we should you should be doing an episode as well
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.480]   That's the new thing by the way
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:36.640]   Do you see josh malina is doing a west wing podcast where they do a show per episode they deconstruct west wing?
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.840]   Yeah
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.560]   What? And josh appeared in the last three seasons of west wing
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.920]   Yeah, well the the fun thing is that mostly it's like oh my god
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.920]   This is like the most awesome song ever
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.520]   Yeah, that's probably what i'd be saying i cried i cried
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.680]   As a way of encouraging you to like run run yellow lights
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:58.720]   I'm going to tell you the sad story about this person i met at the commuter rail station a few weeks ago
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:02.480]   And we're just talking because we were 20 minutes before our train and he said oh, yeah, boy
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:08.160]   This delay is nothing. You know, I was my train was delayed like six hours a couple weeks ago and i theater tickets
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:12.880]   That they were talking talking talking in a half hour later. Well, what show was it it was hamilton?
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:18.480]   He did make it. I hope no he didn't he missed the he missed the show
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:24.640]   The this was like earlier, but like there was like a track there's like a track accent or something or so tracks broke down
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:30.000]   Six hours late he had met nate ticket up. I know this that's like that's like the one
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.280]   That's that's like having a lot of even numbers you always play every week
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.880]   I don't want to hear it. I still
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.880]   Go go go go go
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.200]   The next shot of you should be like the chair spinning
