[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.160]   How are you all?
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.840]   We decided we didn't want to work this week.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.760]   So you know what that means.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.800]   You get the best of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.400]   Hey, it's not new if it's new to you.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.600]   No, wait a minute, that's the wrong.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.320]   It's new.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.840]   If you haven't seen it, that's still a rerun, no matter what.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.680]   But some great moments, the moments
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.120]   you voted for, the best of Macbreak Weekly from the year 2010.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.360]   Now, I have to say, what was the big story in the Apple
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.520]   world for 2010?
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.960]   That was the iPhone 4, and most importantly,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.760]   the iPad, which was announced early in the year.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.840]   And in fact, in this first clip, the iPad hasn't come out yet.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.600]   And we really wonder if that KG Andy Inako doesn't already
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.200]   have one.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.280]   Let's see.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.800]   Today, there is nothing but the iPad.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.160]   Nothing but the iPad going on, starting from my left,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.520]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is here from the Pixel Core.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.120]   I don't have an iPad yet.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.400]   I just want to point that out.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.600]   OK, what we're going to do is we're going to narrow it down.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.360]   So Alex does not.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.560]   Also joining us today from Liverpool, England,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.960]   he's so excited about the World Cup coming up.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.920]   I'm stereotyping.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.160]   Mr. Don McAllister.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.400]   Hey, Leo, I could see it.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.840]   It's good to see you from ScreenCasts online.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.480]   That's the one.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.200]   That's the one.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.640]   And I haven't got an iPad either.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.480]   And you don't have an iPad, so I don't have--
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.320]   How many people is a couple of cutouts on iPad?
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.360]   I don't have an iPad, so there's only one person who
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   could possibly have an iPad in the bunch.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.360]   We don't have one.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.560]   Andy Anaka has even to be making out with a--
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.200]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.600]   --with a tag on its ear.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.800]   I'm going to get you a biscuit.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.760]   You're such a good dog.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.280]   He's great.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.400]   He's very patient.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.760]   Bestest dog ever, Fuster.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.160]   He's a writer.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.480]   He's so good for us now, because he has an iPad and we don't.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   Huh?
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.680]   What's that, Fuster?
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.240]   That's right.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.440]   I love you, because you don't ask stupid questions.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440]   You're going to get cookie.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440]   You're going to get cookie.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   You're going to get cookie.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.880]   OK, there you have it.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.040]   Andy Anaka is non-denial.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   You are the real?
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   Yes.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   Hi.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   Good to see you.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.120]   Andy, once again, from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.000]   in the celestial waste of Dan with Merlin Mann
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.600]   has the day off.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.240]   He's on assignment.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.160]   Looking for an iPad.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.360]   Yeah, probably.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.520]   Do you think-- who do you think has an iPad?
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.840]   Do you think that David Pogan want
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.720]   Mossberg and Ed Begg have an iPad?
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.360]   Yes, not that I'm bitter.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.160]   They probably do, right?
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.920]   Andy, you're an actual journalist, as opposed to those of us
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.200]   who play them on the radio.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.720]   Yes.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.040]   Do you think that Apple has seeded some of the premier press
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.480]   with an iPad so that they can get their review out?
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.480]   Fuster?
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.480]   Fuster?
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.760]   I'm going to have to--
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.760]   He has trouble opening the jar himself.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.360]   I'll be right back.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.400]   It's-- oh, dear.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.920]   OK.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   I guess it's like--
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.560]   I think no words need to be spoken on that.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.080]   I think it's like sculling bones.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.200]   If you say the words, he has to get up and leave.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.000]   It's in the Apple NDA.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.480]   So I'm thinking-- I think he might happen to have one.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.440]   It could happen.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.440]   [SIGHS]
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.160]   I saw the videos.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   Have you seen the videos?
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.280]   No, there's videos online.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.160]   Yes, there's--
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.120]   So there's videos.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.800]   Apple has posted the videos of kind of like their how
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.160]   to use it and how easy it is to use.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.560]   And it is--
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.640]   I'm at the Apple site now, a magic and revolutionary--
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.160]   magical.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.000]   I'm training--
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.680]   Wow, that's an interesting selling point.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.520]   It's magical.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.000]   Expelliarmus.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.360]   Nothing happens.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.000]   I see great--
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.800]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.560]   We can have an iPad.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.560]   Show.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.360]   That's right.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.760]   Good boy.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.920]   Remember, we'll be more of these later on.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.080]   Boy, good boy.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.080]   Good boy.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.680]   With a good man, coach crazy.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.120]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.720]   We were saying something?
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.040]   Nothing, nothing at all.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.000]   Just looking at the iPad on the Apple website,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.520]   that this is a new tagline.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.480]   I don't remember this tagline.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.400]   A magical and revolutionary product
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.920]   at an unbelievable price.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.320]   So it's magical, revolutionary, and unbelievable.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.840]   [LAUGHS]
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.760]   So Apple's saying that we cannot believe any information
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.800]   they posted on their site.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.680]   Yeah, I really wouldn't use the word unbelievable
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.840]   in a slogan, would you?
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.800]   Like when they say how well it'll work in these situations
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.520]   and how nice the interface is, we're
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   not to believe any of that.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.020]   No.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.520]   They're just a disclaimer.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.760]   They have legal cover now.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.320]   Unbelievable.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.960]   Well, they say the price is unbelievable.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.360]   But once you use the word unbelievable,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.440]   I think I think it's safe to not believe anything.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.240]   So now they've got these guided tours online.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.000]   This is what you were talking about.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.640]   Oh.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.120]   So which one?
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.640]   Oh my god.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.280]   You can drink coffee while I'm using it.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.800]   No, I won't even go for it.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.960]   Look, there's a mug.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.480]   Look at Keynote.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.920]   Look at Keynote.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.400]   Keynote.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.720]   OK.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.520]   This is the one.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.200]   Alex says he's actually going to do his presentations.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.720]   If I can--
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.000]   I'm going to test my presentations for--
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.560]   An AB.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.880]   They work. I'm going to do my presentations and AB off my iPad.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.320]   So did you order the VGA dongle?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.720]   Keynote on iPad has the most powerful presentation
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.560]   application ever made for a mobile device.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.080]   Oh, come on.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.920]   The superlatives are driving me nuts.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.360]   Just for iPad, it makes it easy to create incredible presentations
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.840]   with photos.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.280]   Incredible.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.480]   OK.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.520]   So far, we've got--
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.200]   Incredible animations.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.480]   I think just the touch of a finger.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.320]   Look, I just--
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.520]   I don't need him to say anything.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.440]   I didn't want him to get started.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.200]   OK, we'll turn his sound off.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.760]   Sometimes it seems as though these
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.960]   are being narrated by Jets fans.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.560]   This is so awesome.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.480]   It's unbelievable.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.080]   It shows you all of your presentations
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   with a large preview.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.760]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.680]   Do you think they do like they did with the iPhone
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.280]   and get really big hand models to make it--
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.000]   or rather, you'd want a small hand model
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.480]   to make it look bigger, right?
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.280]   Like, your hands are too big.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.720]   On the iPhone, they had big hands
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.200]   to make it look smaller.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.680]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.720]   It shows you that things change.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.440]   The other question I would have is that they don't really
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.800]   have to give this actor like a working thing.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.280]   They could just give them a blue screen mock up or a square
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.920]   and simply say, I want you to start your finger there
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.160]   and drag it down there.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.400]   Then I want you to tap that and tap that there.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.880]   I'm always curious about how these videos get produced,
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.920]   given the level of secrecy that Apple keeps this device under.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.280]   You know, it's one of those things that--
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.120]   I mean, we do a lot of these, this kind of stuff.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.760]   This looks so clear and crisp.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.320]   It would be very painful.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.320]   It would definitely be possible with the right budget
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.440]   to do any of this stuff in post.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.920]   But if I could, I would do everything I could
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.760]   to make it work long.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.560]   How can they make it look that good at shows?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.240]   Well, you could do it.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.960]   You could do it.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.520]   The problem that you get into is what you're
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.680]   going to be afraid of is that it isn't the way I am--
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.920]   It's not going to match his hands.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.240]   Well, the way I animate it won't be identical to the way
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.200]   it actually works.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.280]   And then people will be like, right, right.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.080]   So it's easier to get--
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.840]   This is really cool.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.800]   You gotta think it's real.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.120]   So you want to resize it here, and then you tap that one,
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.600]   and it automatically sizes them.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.680]   It's the same.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.360]   I was like--
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.640]   There's a lot of little features in there that are better
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.120]   than keynote.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.720]   And then I do a lot in keynote.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.640]   It sounds like people should watch these videos,
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.320]   because I mean, who would have discovered that?
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.480]   No, no, look at this.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480]   Oh.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   Oh.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   Oh.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   Oh.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.520]   It's a unique interface, and Apple's never done touch before.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.080]   And they're huge.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.520]   Except for on the iPhone and iPod touch.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.000]   Right.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.280]   But not on a desktop.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.920]   And so to see a keynote with a touch interface
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.000]   really kind of shows what touch--
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.480]   I mean, I was watching this today.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.760]   And the thing that really amazed me--
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.120]   and I've seen the demos before, but it just looks so advanced
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.200]   compared to a Mac, even though it's a simpler idea,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   using your fingers and just manipulating stuff with your fingers.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.360]   It actually seems more advanced.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.800]   It's simpler, but more advanced.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.440]   And I'm sort of wondering if people start using the iPad,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.720]   whether or not-- you would imagine that there'll be a Halo
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   effect and they'll go-- they want to switch the Mac.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.080]   Actually--
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.920]   And they'll be disappointed.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.200]   And the Mac is actually--
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.960]   it could be a downward step, because they've got this--
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.120]   Do they have to?
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.920]   So maybe a conspiracy theory here,
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.840]   the reason we haven't seen MacBook Pros
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.200]   is because they will be touch screen,
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.360]   and they're waiting until-- because if they made it touch,
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.920]   then they could put these features into--
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.800]   they have to have multi-touch on the screen, right?
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   I don't know.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.560]   I mean, Apple doesn't do things.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.240]   They're going to have to have way.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.760]   I mean, they had so many opportunities to do a tablet Mac.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.040]   That was just simply-- we're going to repackage a MacBook
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.720]   in a touch interface.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.480]   They didn't do it.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.680]   And we're not going to do that.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.560]   So I don't know.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.880]   If they ever did it--
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.520]   I really think--
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.320]   I really just look-- they have two different product lines
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:43.880]   going on here.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.680]   Conspiracy theory number two.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.360]   Yeah, they have two product lines,
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.640]   and one is going to slowly eclipse the other.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.560]   And it's not the one we want.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.800]   I think absolutely that the touchpad--
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.160]   the iPhone and the iPad is the future of Apple.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.640]   I think that they're desktop Mac.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.240]   I think most of us will have a long time to get to play,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.280]   continue to use our Mac Pros and our MacBook Pros
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.320]   and everything else.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.160]   But I think there's maybe a 10-year cycle before.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.880]   We're more moving towards this.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.840]   I think this is really the beginning of a new kind
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.080]   of computing, and I think it is the future.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.280]   Only the video definitely makes it look like this works far
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.440]   better than any Android device I've ever seen.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.080]   I mean, I just-- I have no confidence, really,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.440]   in their ability to get any-- in Google's ability
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.560]   to translate this interface from something that
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.760]   is simply functional and practical to something that
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.200]   really, really works exceptionally well.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.120]   I think this is the price of settling.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.080]   How about you, Don?
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.640]   You do screencasts online.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.160]   You do a lot of Mac screencasts.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.240]   I can imagine you looking at this saying, hm, this would be--
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.000]   Oh, look at that.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.500]   Nice.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.000]   Nice.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.240]   Nice little features.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.920]   I mean, there's a technical thing I need to get over us
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.240]   how we actually capture the video.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.740]   Right.
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.400]   I'm hoping I can do that with a hardware device,
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.560]   so I can actually capture the video coming out of the machine.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.080]   But until we actually get one, and we can understand how
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.640]   that's going to work, can we do that?
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.680]   Because I don't know whether you're going
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.560]   to be able to see the interface.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.800]   That's the thing that I'm not sure of.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.560]   It appears--
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.920]   Yeah, I ordered that VGA dongle.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.840]   It's going to arrive Saturday when my iPad arrives.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.960]   Believe me, first thing I'm doing is plugging it in to see
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.360]   what I can get.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.920]   I don't think you're going to see the interface.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.360]   I think what's going to happen is
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.720]   that it's going to be applications can output
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.560]   an output of function.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.280]   Every time we've seen them connect it to a TV,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.760]   there's something different on the iPad than there is on the TV.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.520]   So I don't think it's ever mirroring the TV.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:37.840]   I mean, I--
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.180]   OK.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.760]   So when you were looking closely at Steve's presentation,
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.440]   there was something else on that thing.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.400]   Every time he hit it, it was sending something different.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.200]   Like when you watch the keynote one, what it does
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.880]   is it sends the presentation forward,
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.440]   but they're seeing something completely--
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.400]   You're seeing that you're crawler on your--
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.040]   Well, but that you can do with keynote anyway, which is--
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.000]   I mean, I would do it on a--
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.400]   I don't think it's mirroring-- I don't think it'll mirror
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.040]   the interface, because the iPhone doesn't mirror the interface.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:03.520]   And--
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.640]   But the iPhone doesn't have video out.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.960]   They don't have that dongle.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.920]   You should be able to do video out, I think, on it.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.800]   Yeah, you can--
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.080]   They sell a dock to VGA.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.280]   I believe so, yeah.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.160]   Oh, that's news to me.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.160]   But it doesn't do--
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.960]   But it plays your videos.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   The iPhone one isn't a VGA dongle.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.280]   No, it's a little plug.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.600]   It's a plug that goes in the top, which is going to have--
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.880]   That's also available on the iPad.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.800]   This is something different.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.360]   This is a dock connector to VGA.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.320]   And so the real question is, what are we going to see?
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.240]   Andy, you've got one.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:33.960]   What do you think?
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.920]   Moving right along.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.080]   I keep trying.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.080]   I keep trying.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.600]   Let me put it this way.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.520]   I'll explain something very, very carefully
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.440]   that I think that as soon as I say this,
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.080]   everybody will understand the correctness
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.360]   of this statement knowing me very, very well.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:52.880]   Two things.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.880]   Number one, either I have one and I don't.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.720]   If I didn't have one, especially like four days
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.680]   before the release, I really want people
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.560]   to think that I have one.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   Because if they think I don't have one,
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.480]   that's not as fun as people think that I have one.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.240]   It makes me look like a really big guy,
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.160]   if I make people think that I have one.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.400]   Number two, I make this pledge to everybody.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.280]   Everybody in this conversation, all these listeners,
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.960]   all these viewers that I guarantee you that the moment
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.640]   that I have an iPad, the moment that I'm free to talk
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.520]   about having an iPad, which may not be both true
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.800]   until April 3rd, I'm going to be such a total about it.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.120]   You, I mean, if I had the ability to like any time
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.560]   before the release date on Thursday,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.600]   prove that I have an iPad and other people don't,
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.800]   you will see me, I'll make like an iPad cod piece
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.640]   and Mark doesn't.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.760]   Middle of the street.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.600]   It's singing like a very song if I have one you don't,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   I am that small and paddy.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.440]   I mean, just in terms of ego.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.280]   So yeah.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:00.080]   It's fun to remember those naive innocent days
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.960]   before the iPad came out.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.480]   That was something.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.320]   Actually, in just a moment, we're going to go to the iPad launch,
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.840]   which we had a lot of fun doing live from San Francisco.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.680]   But before we do, and I do hope you're enjoying
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   our best of episode, a little reminder to visit audible.com.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.680]   Audible.com/MacBreak to be exact.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.680]   To get your free book, I find it hard to believe
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.920]   that there's anybody who watches MacBreak Weekly
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.520]   who hasn't yet joined Audible.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.960]   You, you haven't, this is your chance.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.560]   A free book waiting for you.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.320]   There've been a lot of great books this year.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.560]   I really, I think the book I enjoyed the most
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.840]   and I listened to it on Audible was Jonathan Fransen's
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.880]   Freedom, a great novel, really the novel of the year.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.480]   But there's so many other wonderful books
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.400]   in science fiction, history.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   I listened to a lot of history.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.880]   I've been listening to, in fact,
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.840]   this might be my second favorite book of the year,
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.600]   Keith Richard's autobiography, My Life,
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.640]   which is in, I guess it's just life.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.760]   It's incredible.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.280]   Read by Johnny Depp for the first like third.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.640]   And then all of a sudden some English guy comes on.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.880]   I think his name is Joe Early.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.800]   And he, all of a sudden, he's got an English accent.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.720]   Sounds just like Keith too, I have to say.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.080]   If you're into the Rolling Stones,
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.360]   or you just like hearing the story
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.640]   of how one of the great rock and roll bands of all time
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.120]   got their start, this is a wonderful book.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.280]   Nice and long too.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.760]   You get your dollars worth.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.560]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.200]   Here's what happens.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.280]   You sign up for the gold account.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.240]   That's a book a month.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.080]   And the first book is free.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.240]   You can cancel it anytime and owe nothing.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.280]   And that book is yours to keep forever.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.360]   So the nice thing about Audible,
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.720]   you don't have to finish the book in a month.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.800]   And this one, unless you've got a pretty hefty commute,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.920]   might take you more than a month.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.080]   It's a long book, but a lot of fun.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.160]   But what I did actually is I downloaded
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.680]   some early Rolling Stones music.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.800]   So I listened to the book.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.200]   And then when he mentions a song, I go in and listen to the song.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.280]   And I listen to some more to the book.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.880]   It's really fantastic.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.080]   Audible.com/macbreak on your iPhone, your iPad.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.520]   I'm listening to it with a great Audible application on Android.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.760]   There's an Audible application for iPhone as well.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.240]   It's fantastic.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.840]   Of course, on your computer and many other devices as well,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.320]   you can even burn them to CDs.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.320]   Audible.com/macbreak, your first book is waiting for you.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.400]   And we thank Audible.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.800]   A tip of the snow cap to Audible for supporting us all year
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.320]   along.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.360]   It's been a great partnership.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.040]   And we look forward to many years with Audible.com.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.640]   Now, time for our next segment.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.280]   The iPad came out in-- was it April?
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.320]   Was it May?
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.760]   It was April.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.680]   All I remember is going to the Moscone Center at San Francisco,
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.800]   seeing all the satellite trucks, all the reporters,
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.840]   all the people.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.120]   And we had great seats right out front.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.520]   I just need another stop by too to join the fun.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.480]   So let's take you now.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.480]   Imagine, if you will, early this year, the launch of what nobody
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.360]   knew if this was going to be big or not.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.880]   Nobody had tried it yet.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.640]   The launch, the first announcement,
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.240]   we didn't even know if it was going to be an iPad.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.080]   We just thought it would be of Apple's iPad.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.960]   Let's watch.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.080]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 177.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.120]   We're live from in front of the Erbobuina Center for the Arts,
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.560]   where just a few minutes ago, Steve Jobs took the stage
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.920]   and announced a brand new category, really, not just
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.560]   a new device, but a new category, the iPad.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.760]   And we're going to do a special Mac break weekly today.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.480]   Back at the studio, say hello.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.440]   It's Alex Lindsey.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.160]   Hi, Alex.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.240]   Hello.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.600]   How's it going?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.400]   And Alex is running the board.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.040]   So any mistakes, it's Alex's fault.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.960]   Ah, that was a pretty active strike.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.400]   I see how it is.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   Also, with us, Dr. Kiki, Kirsten Sanford.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   Hi, Kirsten.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.360]   Hello, Leo.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.200]   It's nice to be here.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.720]   And, of course, on Skype, Merlin, man, an original Mac
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   Break Weekly guy.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.600]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.200]   How's it going, Leo?
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.920]   It's great.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.200]   You guys have been holding down the Fort while we were all
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.000]   in the auditorium.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.280]   I hope we were able to get a pretty good picture of that.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.120]   I mean, it was kind of guerrilla-style.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.440]   But I have to say, Steve looked good.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.440]   His voice was a little weak.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.120]   He looked tired and thin.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.240]   But he did a bang-up job selling what is obviously something
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.840]   that's very important to him, something he's
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.800]   been working on for quite some time.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.640]   It looked fantastic.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.400]   I mean, it really has the fit and finish
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.840]   of a very mature device.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.520]   It didn't look like it was a version one.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.160]   The way we would see it come out from a lot of other
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.600]   applications or a lot of other companies.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.560]   I mean, they obviously spent what looks like years making
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.960]   sure that it was just right before they pulled the trigger.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.240]   Well, and both Phil Schiller and Steve made the point--
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.720]   I think this is a very good point--
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.600]   that this is a device that people already knew how to use.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.320]   They were building on the success of the iPhone and the iPod
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:55.960]   Touch.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.240]   It's the same UI.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.800]   It's just bigger and more responsive.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.680]   It sounded like from your report that you just have a lot more
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.520]   processing power.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.480]   So you're getting a lot--
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.880]   it's just a lot faster, too.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.640]   Yeah, well, in fact, I just--
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.880]   Tina's here, Justine Azerik.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.720]   She didn't get into the event.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.400]   I didn't.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.640]   But I did get into touch the iPad.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.480]   And it really is like a very large iPod Touch.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.760]   There's an experience holding it that doesn't get
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.360]   communicated from watching and the stage presentation.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.640]   It feels--
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.040]   I mean, it's just-- I'm speechless, because it was like
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.920]   amazing.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.160]   It's everything that you would want in a tablet.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.120]   And it's so smooth.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.760]   It really is an experience, which is something
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.120]   that Steve is all about.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.560]   Yeah, it's pretty clear that the refinement that Apple does
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.480]   so well is built into this thing.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.960]   Not only in terms of the user interface, which we're very
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.720]   familiar with, but the fit and finish of the product itself.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.560]   And you're right.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.080]   You said an important word, speed.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.440]   Yeah, no, it's awesome.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.920]   And I mean, it's--
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.640]   How do you like the screen?
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.280]   I like it.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.240]   It's really bright.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.480]   My biggest concern, though, is which one am I going to buy?
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.320]   Am I going to wait for the 3G or the Wi-Fi?
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.400]   But like we were talking before, you mentioned the Wi-Fi,
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.520]   which if you have a Wi-Fi or a Wi-Fi card, there's no
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.120]   point in waiting for the 3G.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.400]   Just in case somehow you missed the details of the
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.440]   announcement.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.520]   In 60 days, you'll be able to get the first versions of the
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.120]   iPad.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.160]   By the way, iPad, were you surprised by that name?
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.240]   A little bit like I really--
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.640]   I was becoming so used to like the little tablet or maybe the
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.280]   iSlate.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.200]   But I don't think the name's really that important.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.880]   It's the obvious name.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.120]   I thought, can we move on from i?
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.920]   But then they have an iBook store, so we're never going to
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.240]   move on.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.720]   Yeah, never.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.780]   So the iPad will be available in 60 days only in the
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.680]   Wi-Fi version.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.600]   There are three Wi-Fi versions.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.680]   There's a 16 gigabyte for $4.99, which is a really
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.520]   relative-- well, $4.99 isn't really that cheap.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.920]   But if you've been thinking 1,000 or even 800, it's cheap.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.720]   And it's a great price.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.640]   Steve did that, by the way.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.840]   He put a $9.99 up.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.640]   Said, this is what everybody's saying under $1,000.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.200]   And then he crashed it to the ground.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.960]   And it was $4.99.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.960]   He really knows how to sell it.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.960]   He really does.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.040]   Always start with a high price.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.680]   And then the low price doesn't seem to seem a lot lower.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.360]   $4.99, $5.99 if you want 32 gigs and 64 gigs, a lot of
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.000]   storage.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.320]   Nope.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.160]   And we lost him there for a second.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.640]   So I'm sure we'll have them back here in just a second.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.440]   And through the magic of technology, no one watching the
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.560]   taped version will know anything.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.720]   You know, they'll just be like, wow, that was so seamless.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:30.920]   And--
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.440]   Well, you used to always say that on Macbreak.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.240]   We used to as a joke.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.960]   We talked about fixing it in post.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.640]   But I think you're really going to need to fix this in
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.080]   post, Alex.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.040]   I'm not going to have to fix it.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.000]   I think we're going to have to--
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.200]   I think we're going to have to fire up the old final cut.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   This one's going to be a rough one.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.080]   No, it breaks your heart.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.800]   But I think you're going to have to edit.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.760]   The iPad naming--
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.160]   I'm still not sure about it.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.960]   I just hope you make a big one in order, Maxie.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.280]   And I'm fortunate.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.080]   Somebody forwarded a linked YouTube video from MadTV.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.400]   They did an iPad spoof back in 2007.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.400]   That's kind of--
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.560]   OK, and we're going to go back to Leo.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.200]   Hold on one second.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.720]   What would you have named it, Merlin?
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.840]   If you don't like iPad, what's better than iPad?
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.200]   I don't know.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   You can hear me.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.640]   Oh, gosh, I don't know.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.200]   I like-- you know, I don't know.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.000]   I got to-- again, I'm a group of his internet boyfriend.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.920]   I like iBook.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.160]   I think iBook would have been a good name.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.640]   I think-- I think iTablet is dumb.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.720]   And I think iSlate sounds like it's made out of a rock
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.400]   until it's heavy.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   iPad is fine.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400]   I'm sure I'll get used to it.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.320]   It's strange that it's so close to iPod, which is something
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.000]   they're not focusing on as much.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.720]   But maybe there's some kind of like little slip disc
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.680]   in your brain that hears that and is familiar.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.240]   I don't know.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.760]   It just seems like the obvious, isn't it?
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.520]   What do you think, Leo?
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.840]   Do you like iPad?
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.640]   I was-- you know, I was saying they're not
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.880]   going to use i at all.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.960]   I had moved on from the notion of i-anything.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.000]   I like the name on it.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.240]   Dwight Silverman is also here.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.120]   Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle blogs.crond.com/techblog.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.160]   In fact, I was calling it iPad several weeks ago
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.000]   before the name iSlate came up.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.600]   I started using that in my blog just as--
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.760]   and then shortly after I did, the stuff about iSlate came out
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   and said, OK, I'm wrong.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.640]   It's not iPad.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.320]   So I was quite gratified.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.720]   I've had-- but that mad TV video was quite funny.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.200]   It was really funny.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.480]   You were gruntled coming out.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.480]   You were not impressed.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.680]   Well, it's a great technology.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.960]   It is very cool technology.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.880]   It's a very sleek product.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.800]   In looking at it, I always try to think, OK, what
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.560]   will the mainstream think about it?
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.120]   We're kind of geeks and we're into this.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:39.400]   But the lady who is in Walmart, who's buying diapers
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.560]   and who kind of lives her life day to day,
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.640]   is just going to interest her in all of the long run.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.400]   And if you can have a $2.99 netbook
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.920]   and do a lot of the same things, which you can do a lot
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.040]   of the same things, is this going to call to her?
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   And I don't know that it's necessarily a mainstream product.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.160]   I think it will go to Apple's core audience.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.280]   It will go to the higher end.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.040]   People willing to spend the higher amounts.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.960]   I was talking to Tim Behren, the analyst,
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.800]   who said that he thinks that the $4.99 one will not
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.880]   be the top seller, that it'll be one of the higher end models.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.200]   It's always been that way when they sold
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.200]   an 8 gigabyte iPhone.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.840]   People really wanted the 16 gigabyte.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.440]   What people want on the iMac is the 27 in time.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.360]   27.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.960]   That's Apple's customer.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.560]   Apple's smart.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.120]   They created the low price point.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.840]   Obviously, that gets the attention.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.120]   People are going to buy the middle one.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.440]   Do you need all that storage, though?
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:41.600]   I mean, a 16 gigabyte iPhone is a pretty big iPhone, isn't it?
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.720]   I haven't even filled my iPhone up.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.760]   And I shoot video all the time.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.040]   So I can't fit all of my music on a 16 gig iPod.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.360]   I don't think you put your music on this device, though.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.720]   What do you think, Alex?
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   Well, you know, me.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.400]   I'll buy the biggest one.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.800]   But 64 gigs.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.520]   I have a 32 gig-- I think a 32 gig iPhone.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.400]   But my iPhone's full.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.560]   I'm constantly-- I have to throw stuff away,
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.880]   turn things on and off to get it all.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.840]   Because I have a lot of shows.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.560]   I travel a lot.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.640]   So I have a lot of shows.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.440]   And I don't have all my music on it.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.960]   On my iPhone, my Zoom is actually what
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   I keep all my music on.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.680]   And so my iPhone just has a couple playlist that I like.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.240]   But I also think that this is aimed
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.400]   at the Walmart audience at least right now.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   But what I do think it does is that--
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.000]   I think it makes it very hard if you
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.400]   have another tablet that's $3.99 or $2.99.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.960]   I mean, I think that we were just talking about that when
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   you guys were restarting is that it's
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.000]   a very difficult market to stay in when
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.360]   you don't have any room to move.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.160]   OK.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.160]   I'm going to let Justine go because--
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.320]   I don't have headphones.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.800]   So I have no idea what anyone would say.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.160]   Well, not only that, I know you want to go play with it.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:50.680]   I do.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.320]   I do.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.000]   It was amazing.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.200]   And I'm really excited for it to come out.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.520]   I really can't wait.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.600]   Get my badge from Roger over there.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.520]   He's got the press.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.040]   OK.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   You could just say you're me.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.400]   All right.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:25:59.960]   Sounds good.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.640]   I look like Leo.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:00.960]   Which one?
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.600]   Thank you.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.200]   Justine.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.080]   Eric, I just teed.com.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:04.600]   Bye, guys.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:12.320]   Andy Inoco, your pick of the week, my friend.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.200]   I'm standing carefully out of the way
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.960]   because I think some of you are going to guess
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.040]   what my pick of the week is.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.400]   Let's see how well this works.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:18.920]   Hang on.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.640]   Oh, my God.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.480]   What's going on?
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.280]   Oh, no way.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:26.800]   Oh, my God.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.520]   They're special.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.000]   They're helicopter.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.920]   Hover and roll.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.400]   Stand.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.520]   They got up, up, up.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.480]   Oh, shoot at us.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.480]   Whoa.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   He's dead.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.240]   Oh, the humanity.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.560]   Oh, my God.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.040]   It's-- oh, my God.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.200]   Are you OK, Andy?
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.400]   OK, the good news is it's very durable.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:51.360]   That one-- it's not supposed to happen.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.120]   Well, it's-- you see, what you're supposed to do is--
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.320]   And he doesn't, by the way, he doesn't have the special protective
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.960]   bumper ring on it either.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.120]   All right, play with this at CES.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   It is so awesome.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.160]   Yeah, it's so awesome.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.520]   We lost you.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.760]   We're not hearing you, but we're seeing it.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.200]   No, no.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:08.720]   I'm stepping.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.360]   You hear me know?
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.040]   Oh, you were not-- you weren't on my game.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.640]   OK.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.200]   Well, because I was trying to hold the--
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:13.960]   I know.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.120]   It's too many things.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.520]   It's really difficult to pilot it while watching yourself
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.000]   on the remote screen over here.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.960]   What you're supposed to be doing is actually looking
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.600]   at your iPhone screen.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.400]   And-- hang on a little bit.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.840]   If, folks, if you didn't watch today's show on video,
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.600]   you really must go to twit.tv/mbw and get the video version.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.080]   Well, actually, I'm inadvertently
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.920]   showing off something kind of cool.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.880]   We're-- a lot of this now, so--
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.080]   OK, let's see.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.920]   Backing up one second.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.080]   It is a--
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.600]   OK, we now know he's not wearing shoes.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.960]   So there's a camera on this, however.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.040]   There's a camera on it.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.960]   Here we go.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.320]   This is going to be just like Avatar.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   It's a multi-camera setup.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.120]   Ooh.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:02.680]   There we go.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   Ooh.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680]   Ooh.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   Ooh.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.200]   OK.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.800]   So there's a video camera on--
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.680]   There we go.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.840]   There's a video camera on the helicopter.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.240]   God, I have to hold the camera--
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.160]   I have to hold the copter steady and the phone steady.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.360]   OK.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.240]   I have to have a look at either of these things.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.360]   So you have a full control deck in front of you.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.680]   And so you actually can steer and navigate
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.040]   by looking at the camera, not necessarily
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.120]   by trying to look around outside the camera, which
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.240]   is what I was trying to do.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.600]   But the cool thing is that if you do nothing--
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.280]   if you don't touch the controls at all,
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.480]   it uses its own logic to simply say,
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.040]   what do I have to do in order to hover in position where
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.200]   I am right now?
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.360]   So essentially, if I simply let it hover right now
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   and let it chew up my arm because I've got the blades
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.160]   and now exposed, it would simply sort of like bob a little bit,
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.760]   but it will pretty much stay where it is right now.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.800]   But there are also two controls to the left
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.520]   and the right of the iPhone screen.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.240]   One that's-- it's using one control just for elevation
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.280]   and rotation, and the other one is for to control where
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.160]   it's moving, where it's leaning one way,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.960]   or another to move around.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.600]   And it is pretty hard to damage.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.240]   The fact that it's not impossible to damage
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.000]   is demonstrated by the fact that if you go to the website,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.640]   there are lots of replacement parts available for this.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.760]   But I've been playing with it for the past three or four days,
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.960]   and I haven't broken it yet.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.120]   It is a hell of a lot of fun.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.280]   Obviously, I'm not quite good enough with it yet
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.320]   that I can do that really cool thing where this thing hovers
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.440]   and doesn't even stray one inch as it
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.600]   parks itself in front of the video camera.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.160]   But you see how sophisticated some of the controls are.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.120]   What it's showing me right now is that it detects--
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   it's told the helicopter told the iPhone that I've
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.720]   crashed into something.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   So I've turned myself off because clearly,
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.040]   you don't know what you're doing at this point in time.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.840]   So now I have to actually hit a reset switch
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.320]   in order to get it going again.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.840]   I'm now going to turn it on again to see how well I can do.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.320]   I'm going to back--
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.160]   I'm going to leave the room with it.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.800]   They've really perfected this a lot since we saw it at CES,
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.280]   haven't they?
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.160]   That's a really great thing.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.640]   It's become a real consumer product.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.960]   OK, so I'm going to step away from the mic.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.880]   Let me see if I can get it to go in front of the camera.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.040]   And now Andy is stepping away from the mic
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:18.520]   to see if he can--
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:18.880]   Also--
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.760]   --shop his camera in half.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.320]   Well, also realize that there's a camera.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.480]   There are three sets of lights.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.640]   There's a microphone.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.720]   You're going to see some crashing.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.880]   Hang on.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.720]   This is the parrot, right?
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.040]   This is the parrot AR, if you want to go for the thing.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:32.480]   Here we go.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   I just want to make sure that this is the same one we saw.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.040]   It's got primes.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.360]   Now stepping into the safety cage.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.640]   So these safety shrouds are not off, by the way.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.720]   You're supposed to put that special bumper on it
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.880]   so it doesn't chop your head off.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:47.360]   Here he goes.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.680]   He's now using the iPhone.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.280]   It's alive.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.520]   Yeah, I was going to recommend--
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.280]   Oh, look at that.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.680]   Oh, that's so cool.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.160]   I was going to recommend Chopper 2 for the iPhone, which
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.400]   is just a virtual one of these.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.560]   So now he's really kind of--
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.040]   --not boy.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.440]   Now he's taken the asbestos off the ceiling,
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.480]   and now he's in that.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   Oh!
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.520]   OK, I haven't been really interested in listening yet.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.440]   What's the mic?
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.240]   It's fun for you and the whole family.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.840]   Yeah, how much is it?
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.760]   It's like $250, so it's definitely something
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.320]   that in most households, you're going to get your four kids
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.000]   together and saying, how many of you
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.120]   would like to pull together your birthday presents
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.160]   to make this happen?
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:29.640]   It's interesting.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.480]   They call it the flying video game.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.760]   I guess it is, isn't it?
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.600]   There are a bunch of-- it's kind of like what you saw in the demo
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.800]   when you saw the YouTube video where we were at CES,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.680]   where there are a bunch of-- there are pads of stickers
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.040]   so that you can get it to sort of sense its environment.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.000]   It works via a one-to-one Wi-Fi connection between--
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.080]   first, let's make sure that-- OK, good.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.640]   I was about to turn the camera face to you,
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.480]   but you're going to get a really good shot of my butt, maybe.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.960]   And that probably was not going to be too good for the viewers
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.480]   back home.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.600]   But yeah, I mean, you can get it to--
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.040]   it's a one-to-one Wi-Fi connection
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   between any iPod or iPod touch and the helicopter.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.480]   It's a little bit-- I think it inherits a lot from RC
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.960]   helicopter community as opposed to the iPhone community,
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:24.280]   because setting up the software is not 100% there.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.520]   I had to debug a couple of things to get to work,
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.360]   but it's easy to go through the instructions.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.480]   Also, the only other thing I don't like about it
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:36.080]   is that the battery will last about 15 minutes, maybe 10 minutes.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.640]   Right now, there's a battery indicator on the phone itself,
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.200]   and it's telling me that the battery's now at 44%.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.280]   I've been running it for maybe six or seven minutes.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.520]   So it's definitely not something where
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.600]   you're going to be walking the dog and having this thing
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.720]   bobbing behind you as you go.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.480]   But it recharges pretty quickly.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.320]   It also gives you enough time to wrestle
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.280]   your brothers and sisters in the living room sofa
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.680]   to figure out who gets to play with it next.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.480]   It's a hell of a lot of fun.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.080]   - Boy, it sure looks like it.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.280]   - Exactly.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.400]   This was the productivity killer.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   I came back from Chicago, and this was waiting for me
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.960]   on the doorstep, and I'm like, I have better cancel
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.480]   at lunch meeting I have for tomorrow,
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.440]   because I have a feeling I'm going to be.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.800]   I'm either going to be playing with this
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.720]   or repairing a lot of broken lamps.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.160]   (laughing)
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.240]   - The AR drone, a couple of hundred bucks.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.000]   It's ARdrone.parrot.com.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.520]   - And it's all foam.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.240]   So again, I've crashed this thing many times,
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.160]   and it's all tick and just fine.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.880]   - It takes the lick in, and it keeps on choppin'.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.720]   - Exactly.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.560]   - AR drone.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.720]   Boy, you know, I really shoulda let you go last,
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.200]   'cause anything I'm gonna do now
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.280]   is a complete anti-climax to that.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.520]   (laughing)
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:52.560]   Apple stores on Black Friday sold 8.8 tablets per hour.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.480]   Each store.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.160]   Each store.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.960]   - 8.8 per minute or per hour.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.880]   - No, no, each store.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.280]   - Oh, oh each store, okay.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.560]   - You can't sell 8.8 tablets a minute in a store.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.080]   - You can't in the San Francisco store.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.360]   - Yeah, you might be able to.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.600]   - He says, "Pah, also according to,
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.760]   this is to Gene Munster, Piper Jeffery analyst.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.760]   He said, "His team's watched Apple retailers
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.520]   for seven hours and came away with this conclusion.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.600]   This is an interesting statement."
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.120]   And you know, these guys are looking for that, you know,
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.120]   soundbite.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.360]   The Mac, the iPad is the Mac of the masses.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.600]   It's a good soundbite.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   Don't know what it means.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.680]   - Well, that's something that I thought of a few months ago
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.560]   because I realized that a few pictures.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.400]   Oh, gosh.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.320]   I got a picture in my iPhone roll that's dated
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.880]   because I was writing a piece of it.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.280]   I was at the pizza place that I often set up shop at.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.880]   First lesson to people who are in like food retail.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.520]   If you open up a pizza place and the pizza is good
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.680]   and there's unlimited drink refills, don't add free wifi
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.240]   because you're gonna lose tables.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.240]   You know, there's gonna be this guy.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.080]   - You're gonna live there.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:58.920]   - Exactly.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.000]   I'll buy my two slices and then I'm there for four hours.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.480]   But anyway, so I was there and I had my iPad
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.840]   on the little Griffith stand.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.880]   I had my Bluetooth keyboard and I'm actually doing
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.880]   real work on it.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.080]   I suddenly like look at it and I realized that,
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.000]   what does this resemble more than a 128K Mac
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.360]   with that little like, that form factor,
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.680]   the one disc that's working on it.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.520]   - No, good point, yeah.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.360]   - But the same size.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.080]   I wound up like downloading a picture of like the original
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.220]   Mac 128 Hello promo pick and putting that
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.000]   on the screen and then just taking a picture
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.800]   because it just reminded me so much of.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.640]   This is a, also when you think about the original goals
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.620]   of the Mac that was supposed to be a computer
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.800]   that everybody could afford that would cost way,
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.440]   way, way, way, way less than a thousand dollars.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.860]   The priorities that Steve Jobs put on it were going to be
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.160]   that okay, it's not gonna matter that we can't expand it.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.000]   It's not gonna matter.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.480]   There's not a whole lot of apps for it
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.220]   because this is the sort of device we're trying to make.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.660]   And so they've succeeded in making for most people
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.080]   let's throw in, you know, a hundred bucks
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.300]   for the keyboard and an easel.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.600]   Now they've built a $600 to $1,000 computer
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.920]   that doesn't run every app out there but doesn't have to.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.240]   And once you buy it, that's pretty much all you're gonna do
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.480]   with it, but it's making a lot of people like me
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.520]   really, really happy.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.880]   That's the goal 20 years later, 25 years later,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.840]   they finally met it.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.880]   - I actually said that.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.240]   I'll take credit for that.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.040]   I said that Leo report said that.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.040]   - Went to know, but I said.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.840]   - And I remember sitting in front of the Apple announcement
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.000]   of the iPad and said this is the computer Steve Jobs
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.160]   always wanted to make.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.620]   This was, if he could have made this instead of Mac 128,
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.820]   this is what he would have made because it is,
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.620]   it's the computer for the masses, it's very easy.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.860]   I actually would retract that today because while it is
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:41.300]   a great accessible computer, it isn't quite
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.100]   a replacement for a computer.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.740]   - I think it depends on who they, I mean.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:47.700]   - Of course it depends on who,
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.860]   but it's not a full replacement for computers my point.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.540]   - No, I don't think so, but I do think,
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.380]   I look at the way my--
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.820]   - If they had made this instead of the Mac in 1984.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.980]   - It would have changed the computer.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:57.820]   - It would have changed things,
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.900]   and I don't know if it would have changed things
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.420]   for the better.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.260]   - No, it would have been, this is an accessory.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.540]   - Well, remember what the world was like in 1984.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.500]   I mean, first of all Reagan was president,
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.420]   so everything's gonna stink.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.260]   Second thing though.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.100]   - Oh Jesus.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.100]   (laughing)
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.540]   - There we go, hello.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.340]   - See, I thought that we got a little Peppa ball.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.820]   - Sanja lettuce and then I'd go.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.540]   - From sea to shining sea.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.380]   - But yeah, I mean, at least remember the look.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.620]   - That was the one with you really.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.340]   Your entire computing world was there on your desktop.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.540]   If you did not have it there on your desk with you,
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.900]   you could not do it.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.300]   Whereas the iPad can do what it does
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:39.220]   and do it so inexpensively because it can live off of
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.300]   getting things off the internet and having an app store
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.100]   that's elsewhere that you don't have to really find
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.220]   some guy who'll mail you a cassette tape
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.260]   and a pad at envelope.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.900]   So yeah, something like this would never work.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.340]   Remember that for 20, when was the first time that you heard
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.340]   about like Elson or other people trying to develop
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.740]   like network computers, that these thin computers
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.340]   that do nothing but run apps that are hosted by a remote server,
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.460]   none of them were able to work chiefly because,
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.180]   again, you needed to have everything there
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.380]   on the table with you.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:11.700]   - Well, I am thinking about an iPad for my wife
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.580]   'cause she's due to replace her computer.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.420]   She has a very old eMac and I'm saying,
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.700]   "You gotta get a new computer.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.380]   It's a power PC.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.020]   It's really out of date."
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.580]   And rather than get an iMac, I have considered
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.100]   'cause all she does is browsing on the web and email
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.660]   and if I get her an external Bluetooth keyboard
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.300]   so she can compose things,
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.460]   it really does almost everything she wants to do.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.980]   - My wife's parents, she was like,
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.280]   "Oh, she's thinking about getting an iPad
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.580]   and then she wasn't sure if she wanted to get an iPad
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.940]   'cause she was looking at the way her parents used it.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.440]   She goes, "Well, they got files everywhere."
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.400]   And they, all they do is text documents and surf the web
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.180]   and I was like, "That's the perfect person
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.180]   to have an iPad.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.760]   It's gonna keep your files from getting all messy
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.380]   'cause they're all gonna go into one other place."
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.740]   And all you're doing is making files.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.480]   - I thought that too with my wife
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.160]   'cause she doesn't know that they're the desktop.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.100]   Remember I told you, I closed some of the apps
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:11.940]   and she said, "What's that?"
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.320]   I said, "Well, that's your desktop."
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.280]   She said, "What are all those things?"
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.680]   I said, "Those are all the things you've saved
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.520]   under the desktop."
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.780]   She said, "Oh, she doesn't want a file system.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:21.780]   She doesn't need a file system."
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.120]   Now interesting, I got her an iPad,
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.020]   no interest in the iPad.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.920]   She's still using the 13-inch MacBook.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.840]   So I guess I don't know.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.080]   She likes a keyboard, I don't know.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.120]   But there you go.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:32.960]   - It's interesting.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.800]   - Go ahead.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.360]   - One last one thing that was interesting to me.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.080]   This is the week earlier today that I packed up
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.280]   like the finally Apple's like 11-inch MacBook Air
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.880]   and it kind of made me modify some of the things
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.680]   I've been saying about the iPad a little bit.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.600]   I know now that a lot of it was just the simple fact
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   that it's a powerful computer that's really light
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.800]   and really thin 'cause I did find that I was leaving the house
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.080]   without my iPad a lot more frequently over the past month
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.000]   than I had when I didn't have that nice,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.040]   tiny little 11-inch MacBook Air handy.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.400]   Now to be fair, there are more instances
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.760]   which I was leaving the house with both the MacBook Air
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.240]   and the iPad because the iPad will always be my book reader
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.840]   and always be my I'm on the train,
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.280]   I wanna read something or do something
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.040]   while I'm in transit from someplace.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.160]   But let's not discount the fact.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.720]   I really had to make, it really was an illustration for me
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.160]   that a lot of it wasn't really the technology,
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.160]   it really wasn't the multi-touch.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.680]   It was a simple fact that we finally have a computer
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.240]   that's this thin and this light that you can just take
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.680]   with you that runs the Mac OS whether you want it or not.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.520]   - I think it's interesting though,
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.840]   I do think there's a before and after there.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.000]   I mean 'cause like I, as a person who owns an iPad,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.920]   I keep on looking at that at the Air
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.760]   which is one of the few Mac,
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.640]   a few Apple products I haven't bought.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.680]   And while I'm really excited about it,
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.960]   I have a 13-inch so I already have something kind of small
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.320]   and I have an iPad, I've got a couple of those.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.160]   And I'm just kind of like,
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.800]   "Oh, do I really need another computer?"
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   - You know that's small, like it's not hefty
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   that has a 17-inch or something like that.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.000]   So I do think if you have an iPad,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.720]   I think that they are very close.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.680]   I think the 11-inch and the iPad are in this very close realm
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.120]   whether you really, I think if I didn't have the iPad,
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.560]   I would definitely buy the 11-inch.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.840]   - Yeah, a close friend of mine just got a MacBook Air,
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.400]   the new one for his wife who's a lawyer
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.800]   and uses her computer very heavily.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.960]   And she had the old MacBook Air
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.120]   and the new one with the SSD drive,
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.520]   he says is night and day that the,
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.520]   you know, while it may not have that high of CPU power,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.920]   he said your experience is just lightning fast.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.920]   - It's 'cause of the SSD.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   It's all you need. - Yeah.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.320]   - It turns out that it's not the CPU,
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.760]   it's the I/O that really makes a difference.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.640]   - Right, and they love it.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.720]   She just thinks it's fantastic.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.400]   - Oh, I'm deeply powerfully and emotionally.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.880]   - I'm trying not to touch the O's very often.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.560]   I don't wanna open it, I don't really wanna feel it,
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.840]   I don't wanna know anything about it.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.680]   - Yeah.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.200]   - I don't wanna taste it now.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.600]   - I was gonna taste it, I was gonna lick it,
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.840]   but now that Leo's licked it,
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.400]   it's like licking someone's candy bar.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.880]   I mean, you know, once it's been lit.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.040]   - I think I licked it.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.080]   - I'm gonna do other things too,
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.120]   then you'll never touch it.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.000]   - No, no, no.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.400]   - So I think it was interesting that Munster and his minions
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.680]   actually just sat in Apple stores with little checkbooks.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.320]   I'm surprised the Apple stores let him go.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.880]   - There goes another one, there goes another one.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.680]   Seven hours, there goes another one.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   So 8.8 iPads an hour, 8.2 max in general an hour.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.520]   Now this is per store, how many Apple stores are there?
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.360]   A thousand?
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.000]   I don't know, how many are, they're quite a few.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.920]   That's a lot of Macs and a lot of iPads,
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.160]   a little bit more iPads.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.520]   He says, despite comments that quote,
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.760]   the 11 inch MacBook Air has been flying off the shelves,
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.320]   Macs sales were down compared to the same,
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.560]   you know, thing that he did last year.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.400]   He said Apple retailers sold,
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.600]   now see I think this is well within the margin of error.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.000]   Instead of 8.2 max an hour, 8.3 max.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.840]   - Yeah, that's no way.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.920]   - No, come on.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.040]   - What do you think this is?
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.880]   A science?
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.460]   - Do not run to TJ Maxx to buy a 390,
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.620]   (laughing)
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.460]   like that double take that got from Alex.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.300]   - The TJ Maxx.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.220]   - How does it, how does this get into,
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:21.300]   do not run to TJ Maxx, they tweeted that they had iPads
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.060]   for $3.99.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:23.900]   - And it turned out.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.100]   - Well, they did, they apparently had 80 of them
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.580]   spread throughout their thousands of stores.
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.780]   And as far as we can tell, they just went out and bought them.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.780]   They're not a reseller.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.020]   - It was just a whole bunch of people.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.020]   - Just to get, and you know what, it worked.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.020]   - You know the technical term for that,
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.020]   it's called bait in switch.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.340]   - Well, I'm sure they said something like,
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.220]   you know, wall supplies last or.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.220]   - Oh, I need his one for that.
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.260]   Why bother with 80?
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.100]   - Yeah.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.940]   - I guess you had to show that you had a good college try.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:48.780]   - Yeah, 80.
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.620]   I know, that's true.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.580]   - You know, it's like, why does it buy one?
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.940]   I guess you could say we have some.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.140]   - Apparently not many got them.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.940]   Marshals and TJ Maxx are the same store.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:03.100]   An email from Steve Jobs when asked,
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:08.100]   "Would you could you match, according to the line to five Mac,
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:13.460]   would you could you match the price that TJ Maxx offered?"
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.420]   Where are you laughing?
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:19.740]   - I'm not entirely convinced that Apple considers TJ Maxx
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.460]   to be a competitor to Apple.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.820]   - I'm the Apple store.
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.580]   What's the difference?
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.820]   We're not selling pants for $11.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.260]   Maybe we should start selling $11.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.420]   - I've never heard an Apple employee say,
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.180]   "Well, match that price."
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.020]   - No, those words don't, yeah.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.700]   They're just like, "You can go over there and get it."
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.540]   - That's the best.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.780]   - When the last time you saw a price differential,
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.660]   more than like $8.
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.500]   - Exactly.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.940]   - So this is, we're the people who are excited about,
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.700]   how is Walmart being able to sell this phone
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.180]   for $8 less than everybody else in the entire world?
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.780]   - By the way, a headline including TJ Maxx and iPad.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.180]   It just really doesn't look right.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.500]   - Ooh.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.500]   - Josh writing his, yes.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.460]   I see that doesn't look at the,
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:03.260]   writing to sjobs@apple.com.
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.780]   Hey Steve, if I walk into an Apple store
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.700]   and ask for you to match TJ Maxx's price, would you do it?
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.100]   Steve Jobs says, "Nope."
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:15.060]   Then he asks, "TJ Maxx, even an authorized reseller."
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.420]   And, "Nope."
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.020]   (laughs)
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:18.980]   - At least we know it's Steve
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.460]   'cause his response was, "Nope."
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.780]   - Do you think he has like an auto script?
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.620]   - Nope.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.860]   - And, you know, the big thing is they're all different.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:27.700]   - Nope.
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.500]   - No, we never see one that's like,
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:29.540]   "Yep."
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.540]   I don't see very many that are,
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.220]   that are like, it doesn't look like
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.620]   someone cut and paste them out.
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.940]   - No, I think he's doing it.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.660]   I wonder if there's just a bunch of mini-steves.
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.820]   - No, I think he's doing it.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.820]   Although if you were trained--
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:43.660]   - It'd be a few hours.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.780]   - They've been like six months in training.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.140]   - If you were gonna be a PR person trying to impersonate Steve,
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.300]   you'd make sure you said things like,
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.900]   "Nope, yup, yup, yup, yup."
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.900]   He's doing the,
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.940]   he's like a laconic ranch hand.
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:57.780]   - Nope.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.780]   - Yeah.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.660]   - Yeah, I'm not gonna do it.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.500]   According to A.C. Nielsen,
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.380]   this is the stupid story of the week,
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.300]   which conducted a survey in October to see
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.660]   which tech products American kids want
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.580]   through the beginning of next year.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.060]   (laughing)
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.380]   - Hmm.
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.100]   - Just, what do you think?
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:18.940]   - Hmm.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.380]   - 17 items on that list.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.580]   - Number one, a Camaro that shoots fire.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.420]   - Yeah!
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.020]   - Number two, a PlayStation eight.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:27.860]   - Yeah.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.980]   - So they talked to kids from the age of six to 12.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.340]   Number one, an iPad.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.780]   Actually, that is kind of maybe a surprise
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.980]   for the kids that age, an iPad.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.580]   A computer and iPod touch tying for second,
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.780]   with 29% saying they wanted those,
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.540]   31% said they wanted an iPad.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.300]   Nintendo DS in the fourth place.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.980]   That's got a scary Nintendo, 25% of kids.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.460]   And this is their market for the DS.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.180]   PlayStation three, any non-iPhone smartphone
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:00.620]   and a mobile phone all tied for fifth place.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.180]   The Apple iPhone, a television,
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.900]   and as yet unreleased Nintendo 3DS,
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.180]   rounding out the top 10 each with 20%.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.340]   An e-reader, the least popular gift
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.780]   of the year, racking 17 out of 17 choices.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:14.260]   - And I just scare Amazon.
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.100]   - Yeah.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.740]   - I buy a lot of Kindle books for my iPad.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:19.740]   So this was a little constraint.
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.300]   I guess they gave him a list of devices
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.300]   and then said, "What do you want most?"
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.140]   - Well, I know that our babysitter,
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.060]   she was asking if that's the iPad
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.420]   and everything else 'cause her nephew wants to buy one
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.700]   or he wants one for Christmas
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.540]   and then when we told her how much it was.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.860]   (screaming)
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.820]   But the, yeah, I know my,
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.460]   the bigger thing I'm having trouble with
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.740]   is deciding how much my son's allowed to use his iPad.
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.700]   'Cause it's really a, you know, he has his own.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.540]   - Well, he has my old one.
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.580]   'Cause I had, you know, the 3G came out
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.140]   and I got, you didn't need to make any excuses here.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.700]   - No, I just, that's my job.
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.540]   - You're among friends, Alex.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.380]   - It's my job, it's my job.
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.820]   We understand you don't need to say that here.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.060]   - My older son, I just bought him one.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.620]   But anyway, so the, but the,
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.500]   the, but I'm waiting for him to destroy it.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.460]   He hasn't destroyed it yet.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.940]   He dropped it last night and hurts.
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:08.780]   But uh.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:09.620]   - You need, you need, this is the case though.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.460]   - I do, I need to get that case.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.340]   I looked at that case and I was like,
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.180]   see, here it is.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.780]   I already bought, I already bought the stand while
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:14.620]   we were sitting there.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.460]   - This is from in Sippyo.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.460]   Well, you know what, tell you what,
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:21.460]   let me just peel this right off of here and give it to you.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.900]   - It's good for a kid, 'cause it's lime green.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:23.740]   - Can I put that one on?
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.580]   - We'll test it.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.340]   - Test it like the, like the Wookie.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.180]   - So it's, it's, it's got the, it's got the silicone rubber,
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.620]   but then it's got the, I like this, they do them for,
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.780]   and Sippyo does them for iPhones too.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.340]   Kind of like a plastic hard shell.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.860]   - No, it needs it, 'cause the only thing that's
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:37.700]   where the corners are.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:38.540]   - And here's the only thing that I'd want though,
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.500]   is that I need, I need something to flap on the front.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.500]   - It doesn't have a flap on the front.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.340]   - I need the flap on the front.
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.140]   - Well, I'll try it though.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.460]   - I don't know if you're gonna flap on the front.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.900]   - Well, the thing is, is that he, he stands on it.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.220]   (laughs)
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.500]   - You need more than a flap if he's gonna stand on it.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.180]   - I looked over, I looked over, I was watching the
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.020]   Stealer game, I looked over, and he's standing on the iPad.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.580]   I said, you know, it's not gonna work much longer
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:58.780]   if you keep on doing that, you know.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.500]   - Just standing on it, I wonder what that was all about.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.340]   - I don't know, I don't know.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.220]   - I don't dance, dance revolution.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.620]   - You know, he's, no, he's not, no, fortunately,
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:07.260]   he wasn't stomping on it, he was standing on it.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.100]   I don't know what.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.740]   - It makes me just this much higher.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.700]   - Yeah, I think he thought it was cool.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.500]   - They asked 13-year-old kids what they wanted,
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:20.100]   number one for 13 and up, a Mac or PC, a computer,
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.460]   then a television, then a smartphone, not an iPhone,
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.260]   then an iPad, a Blu-ray player, an e-reader,
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:28.540]   e-reader bigger with the older kids.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:33.460]   The Nintendo Wii ranked seventh among teens, that's not good.
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.500]   Only 15% wanted a Wii, that's probably 'cause they all
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.380]   had one already.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.780]   - Yeah, away.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.460]   - Then the iPhone, then the PlayStation 3 with 13%.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.060]   Sony PlayStation Portable least desired among teenagers,
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.900]   number 17, you're well, no.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.100]   I didn't even know they still made that.
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.700]   I think I have one around somewhere.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.140]   - Big mug of Michigan.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.060]   I'm gonna have to, you know, to be fair,
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.340]   in the next episode, I'm gonna have to do
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.620]   the Ohio State University or something.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:05.820]   No, Ken says no.
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.740]   Ken bleeds blue and gold.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.700]   So, I hope you're enjoying this best of Mac break weekly
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.220]   to give us a week off and to give you
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.220]   some great memories from the year 2010.
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.220]   All through the year, our shows are brought to you
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.020]   by the good folks at Carbonite, carbonite.com.
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.380]   It's online, backup, done right.
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:27.380]   Mac or PC, I mentioned when Abby went off to a college
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:32.220]   this fall, the first thing I did is I set up her MacBook,
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.780]   I got her a 13 inch MacBook Pro, perfect college computer,
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.060]   although now that the air's out,
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.420]   I might have considered an air.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.620]   But the first thing I did is I put Carbonite on there
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.300]   and I didn't even bother to tell her
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.820]   because she doesn't need to know.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:46.020]   Carbonite is always automatically backing up
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.500]   to the internet so that her data is there
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.700]   and if anything should happen,
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.060]   if she should lose the laptop,
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.500]   these things happen in college,
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.540]   the hard drive should fail
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.700]   or she should accidentally delete a file,
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.100]   I know I'll get that call and I'll say,
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.300]   "Hey, no problem, honey."
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.340]   Just go to the library log into your Carbonite account
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.340]   and there's all your data.
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.260]   It's been backing up all along.
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.300]   There's also an iPhone app
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.860]   and a BlackBerry app she can use too.
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.620]   Carbonite was invented by David Friend
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.340]   because his daughter was in college and called him
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.620]   and had lost her thesis and he said,
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:14.860]   "There's gotta be a better way
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:18.140]   and came up with really what is the ideal form of backup."
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.980]   Automatic, off-site, encrypted so it's private,
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.780]   couldn't be easier to use and so affordable at $55 a year.
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.500]   That's less than 15 cents a day
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.180]   for unlimited backup, all your personal data
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.180]   on your internal hard drive.
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:34.100]   It's Carbonite.com, but don't take my word for it.
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.540]   I like you to try before you buy
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.900]   and we've arranged for Carbonite to give you 15 days free.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.020]   So if you go to Carbonite.com,
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.700]   use the offer code MAC break,
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.100]   you could try before you buy,
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.780]   see how Carbonite works for you
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.980]   and remember if you do decide to buy it,
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.500]   make sure you use the word MAC break as the offer code
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.340]   and you'll get two months off the already low $55 a year.
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:57.260]   Carbonite.com, offer code MAC break,
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:59.100]   you gotta back it up to get it back.
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.140]   I know you've been planning to,
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.420]   you've been meaning to, do it right now.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.460]   Carbonite.com, it's the best way to back up.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.420]   Now, one of the things people really seem to like
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.500]   about MAC break, in fact, it's got to the point now
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.340]   where we never get started for like the first hour before
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:17.020]   because the pre-shows, the just the conversation,
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.020]   the nuttiness that goes on before MAC break,
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.220]   it's so much fun.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.060]   I think it's partly because we've all been working together
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.540]   for so long, we really love each other,
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:25.900]   we have a great time in it.
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.180]   Really, we think of the pre-show as our chance
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:31.900]   to kind of shoot the breeze before we get down to work.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.860]   So we've decided to put, since I know many of you
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.220]   feel the same way,
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.900]   we've decided to put together a montage
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.820]   of some of the best pre-show moments.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:41.500]   This is stuff that never aired on MAC break weekly,
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.620]   it's stuff that happened on Twit Live
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.500]   before MAC break weekly began.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.500]   I hope you enjoy it coming up.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:55.860]   - The musical interlude with this two.
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:56.700]   - And the,
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:02.180]   so they, for the three days, that's us.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.020]   (laughing)
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.260]   They said it was MAC break.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.820]   (laughing)

[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.060]   - I'm such a first member, Rita.
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.500]   - We need like a little MAC break dude
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:53.660]   to like do some break-games.

[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.220]   (laughing)
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:02.060]   - And people might read that the wrong ring.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:05.220]   Because of FCC guidelines.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.180]   Five minute electronic burrito delay.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.580]   - We're sorry for the time you spent
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.980]   on the tarmac this morning,
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.780]   but our pilot is eating a breakfast burrito.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.620]   (laughing)
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.580]   As soon as she's concluded his breakfast burrito
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:17.580]   will be all around.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.660]   - We don't wanna be taking off while we have a burrito
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:20.900]   in our hand.
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.980]   - So we should be able to get the show launched
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.340]   in about 10 minutes.
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.580]   We'll give you updates as new condiments develop.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.220]   (laughing)
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.300]   - That's very good.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.820]   - You must have spent some time flying my friend.
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.460]   - In the meantime, your flight attendants
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:37.020]   will leave the cabin door open
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.620]   so that you can watch me eat.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.860]   (laughing)
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:46.980]   - Do we put bloopers in the town?
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.380]   If you're watching, let's save those
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:49.460]   and put them at the end.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.500]   We haven't done bloopers in a while
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.100]   and we used to do that all the time.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:53.940]   - That was so much fun.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.780]   - The reason, one of the reasons.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.700]   - That was like the best part of Twitch.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.540]   - Yeah.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:58.380]   - When it was grabbing all the bloopers and editing them in.
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.220]   - I agree.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.580]   - The reason that we started late,
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:01.620]   we would always start a little late
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.100]   is 'cause I wanted to have a little blooper time
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:03.940]   at the beginning.
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:04.780]   - Right.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.620]   - Uh huh.
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:06.540]   - Now the truth comes out.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.420]   - We still start late, we just don't keep the bloopers.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:10.580]   - Well, we oughta be.
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:11.740]   - We oughta be.
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:12.580]   - We oughta.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.420]   - My God.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.380]   - Save it for the Christmas show.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.060]   - We need to create a library.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.860]   A library of craziness.
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:22.300]   - All right, I've got recorders going in every quadrant.
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:25.300]   Ah, I know what I haven't done yet.
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.500]   Andy Anotko, Alex Lindsey.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.780]   - Evidently this, this right here.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.620]   - I just heard my name.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:33.460]   - People who are watching,
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.300]   evidently this, if a chimpanzee does this to you,
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.580]   it's a sign of aggression.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.260]   - So do not pat it.
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:41.900]   - So don't look at, don't look at this video.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.100]   Yeah, don't pat him if he looks at you and goes like this.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.580]   - Oh, he's a duke doodle boy.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.020]   Ow, my finger, my finger.
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.860]   He's not excited, he's not interested.
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:50.900]   - He's mad.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.420]   - Okay, not that you didn't just like really,
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.780]   it wasn't a really subtle way
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:55.900]   to put that in the conversation,
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:57.100]   but I'm telling you,
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.100]   if there are rumors that you're injecting yourself
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.940]   with Botox, now that you're losing weight,
[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:03.300]   I never believe those rumors.
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.300]   So you don't have to prove to everybody else
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.500]   that you've got mobility in your forehead.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.260]   - Why, wait, wait, wait, here we go, here we go.
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:11.660]   - Last time I was on you,
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:15.100]   it's somehow gone to some clinic and I don't know where,
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.100]   some islands.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.180]   - Well, I just want to point out
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.220]   that Chris Breen's hair never moves.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.940]   - I don't know, I think it's actually--
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.660]   (laughing)
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:25.660]   - I've heard that today,
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.900]   Chris Breen's hair is actually ceramic.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.580]   - It is, it moves in one of the seasons
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:31.820]   from one of his hair pieces.
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:32.900]   They don't come off.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:36.300]   - I have that problem too, it's like--
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.460]   - You got the Gatorade bucket, just nothing.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.340]   - You know, it'll just sit there like a sculpture.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.180]   - Too much spray.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:46.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:50.780]   Hey, if I type Merlin off just by one key,
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:52.180]   it comes out as Nurt Cub.
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.180]   - Huh?
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.540]   - Huh?
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:56.380]   - That's pretty good.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:57.700]   - I think you're gonna say Merkin.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:58.540]   - Nurt Cub.
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:01.780]   - Nurt Cub, let's try Manoff by one key.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:05.020]   And do you want me to do a Kung Fu grip?
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:06.220]   - 43 folders, it's fine.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.700]   - Really, I haven't posted anything there lately.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.740]   - Only two things yesterday, Leo.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.820]   - Oh, Merlin, you're back.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.140]   - Itches back, suck it.
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.860]   (laughing)
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.220]   No, don't actually suck it, I was kidding.
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.380]   That was just a real mark.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:20.860]   - I got 43 folders and a bitch eight one.
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:22.020]   - Everyone's more of a cudless.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.460]   (laughing)
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.540]   - That made me laugh.
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.780]   (laughing)
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.740]   - I don't know what that means.
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:30.740]   - Yes.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.700]   - Oh, that's Jay-Z.
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:33.620]   - I know what it is.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:36.100]   I'm not that unsquared and hip.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.580]   - How do you know Jay-Z?
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:38.420]   - I know Jay-Z.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:39.260]   - I love Jay-Z.
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.300]   I'm a rap, I love rap.
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.700]   I'm more of an atmosphere kind of guy
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.660]   because I find their lyrics are more relevant
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:49.180]   to the urban issues that we all face these days.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.340]   - Fresh.
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.180]   - You block that street.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.500]   - Yeah, it's Santa Cruz and Petaloo.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.100]   I'm in a New York state of mind.
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:04.220]   - My wife used to sit on a ball.
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:05.260]   She had that at work.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.380]   She had a yoga ball, she sat on it.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.540]   She said it's good because it helps your core.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.380]   That's a Pilates.
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.220]   - Do it, yeah.
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:12.060]   - I do make her Pilates.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.220]   - But all day, it gets a little sticky.
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:17.380]   - I know, they're just to wear pants.
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.620]   - You're really, I mean,
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.660]   I think that's run of the basic rules of this.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:21.820]   - You're not gonna use that ball anymore.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:24.100]   (laughing)
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.860]   - I mean, it got a moonland.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.660]   - Oh, dear.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:28.900]   You know, I was wondering what those,
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:29.860]   you know, everybody.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.660]   Okay, wow.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:33.500]   - This is good.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.420]   Hey, aren't you glad to have me back?
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.660]   Really just get that focus.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:38.660]   - Yeah, just an anti-bacterial rubber on the ball.
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:39.500]   Thank God.
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:44.180]   Tom Merritt.
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.460]   - He's at the Apple store in Emeryville.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.740]   Hey, Tom.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.100]   - Hey, Lee, I don't know how long I'll be on
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.940]   because the security guard just came by and said
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:53.660]   there's no filming allowed out here.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.020]   We had to move our gear away.
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.700]   So if I get pulled off into middle.
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.740]   - Just tell him, just tell him there's no film involved.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.580]   - Yeah, I thought it was good to say it's streaming.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:03.620]   There's actually no film.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:04.460]   - I'm just standing.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:05.900]   - We have no film effects.
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:08.700]   So tell us what's the scene in Emeryville?
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.100]   - Right now we've got, I would guess,
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:14.260]   250 people in the reserve line.
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.180]   Last time I checked, there were about 300 people
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.900]   waiting in line on the other side.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.300]   In the first come, first serve,
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.340]   I asked a couple of the Apple people
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.500]   how many units you got in there
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.900]   and they all looked nervously and said, no idea.
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:29.580]   - Hmm, interesting.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:32.260]   - So I haven't heard of them turning off the line.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.940]   I've seen some reports from elsewhere
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:35.300]   where they've told people, okay,
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.860]   no more people in line after this.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.380]   They're just letting people kind of build up over here.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.660]   - Yeah, well, it sounds like the Apple stores
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:46.300]   actually have more handsets than we realized.
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:47.940]   - Now there's an AT&T store down the way
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.820]   that is doing pickups for people who pre-ordered.
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.460]   There's absolutely no line down there.
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.020]   Cheers are beginning right now.
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:54.940]   I don't know if you can hear that,
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:57.980]   but they're finally starting to let some people in.
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.580]   So there you go.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.460]   - It's interesting, legacy village in Cleveland's 750
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.540]   reservations, so he's being shut down.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.380]   Okay, yes.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:07.940]   - I have a live interview for this weekend tech.
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.140]   So you need to shut it down as press.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:10.980]   - Yes.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.220]   - You need to shut it down?
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.540]   - You have a card or anything.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.740]   - I have a card on your hand.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.740]   - I can't feel my hand this room.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.660]   - I feel my smart brother.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.180]   So we got to move up.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.940]   - So just step across the street.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.500]   Actually, Tom, it's okay.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.820]   - Okay, well, that actually, we're gonna take it down.
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.220]   - Yeah, I don't want you to lose your place in line.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.180]   - All right.
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.020]   - Take care.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.340]   Tom Merritt and Emeryville.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.300]   - The AT&T signal.
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.820]   Now we've got five bars right now.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.580]   If I hold it a certain way, Gary,
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:40.140]   and you said you noticed this.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:40.980]   - I did.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.420]   - How do I have to hold it to make that happen?
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.180]   - They say that if you hold it in your left hand
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.300]   with the left corner of the device in your palm,
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.540]   the left bottom corner.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.100]   - Left bottom corner, okay.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.500]   - Look at that.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.340]   Did you see that?
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.180]   - Bars was coming down.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:57.100]   - It just takes a few seconds, but it does go down.
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:57.940]   - It went down one.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.660]   - There it goes again.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.500]   - So I'm actually blocking the antenna with my hand,
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.340]   apparently.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:07.660]   And if I take my hand off, it goes back up.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.100]   - It goes back up.
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.940]   So, gee, yeah, there it is.
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.780]   It's going back up.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.900]   - Hey, Leo, we're here and I'm sorry, your name?
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.740]   - I'm Ray.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.220]   - Ray and Ray's got his iPhone.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:20.100]   Leo, I patched his phone number to you.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.740]   I'm gonna try this coverage idea, if you want to try it.
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:24.300]   - Oh, he has to be hooked up to the Wi-Fi
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.140]   in the Apple Store.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.940]   - Is he hooked up to the Wi-Fi?
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:29.020]   - Or hooked up to the Wi-Fi.
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:30.500]   I sent you a phone.
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.780]   - I'm gonna hang up real quickly with our other caller,
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.540]   and we're gonna give him a call.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.860]   We're gonna see how much better FaceTime is
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.740]   than Skype on a laptop.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.060]   How about that?
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.420]   You're FaceTiming.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.700]   Now, turn your camera sideways,
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:49.580]   turn your phone sideways, so we'll get the portrait mode.
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:53.660]   I mean, landscape mode, yeah.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.500]   Woo!
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.260]   - Awesome. - Look at that.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.420]   - That is awesome.
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.460]   - Again, the frame rate a little slow, this is on Wi-Fi.
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:03.060]   So, it's interesting, 'cause this is on the same connection
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.020]   that we were using for our Skype connection.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.380]   In fact, if I flip back and forth,
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:11.260]   I mean, what's happened? - It looks better, doesn't it?
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.420]   - You can see that.
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:15.660]   The contrast is a little better, I have to say that.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:18.100]   (laughing)
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.100]   This is just weird. - This is like a multi-cam.
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.100]   - Yeah. - We can do 3D.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.580]   - Yeah, we figured this out, we can have,
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.500]   yeah, we can do three of these,
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.580]   and you can have like a little multi-cam thing,
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.180]   like a mobile on a bunch of iPhone.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.820]   - Can't come to the specs, seriously?
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.740]   - We're broadcasting live now.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.820]   (laughing)
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.140]   - I can't talk.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:36.580]   (laughing)
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.980]   - It's a little six. (laughing)
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.260]   Take it easy there.
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.460]   - What's your Twitter account, Ray?
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.660]   - Oh crap, that's gonna be,
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.940]   my Twitter account's complicated.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.220]   Can I just type it in somewhere?
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.220]   (laughing)
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:51.260]   - If you have to type it in, it's no good, dude.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.100]   - Yeah.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:52.940]   (laughing)
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.420]   - It's the other thing that I find really interesting
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.740]   is how stable it looks.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.340]   I think there must be some stabilization going on here,
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:01.380]   either digital or, you know,
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.700]   it's probably some digital stabilization.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.540]   - Oh, I think you're right.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.060]   - 'Cause there's no way, there is no way
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.380]   that I'm holding it as still as I'm seeing it.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.340]   - Hey, Leo, I'm doing some testing here
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.180]   where I'm jiggling in.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.700]   There is definitely stabilization going on in the camera.
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.540]   Jiggling it.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.860]   - Yeah, no, it's much better.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.900]   - You look at this bouncing right now.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:21.100]   - So on the left, folks, is Skype via Alex's laptop.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.460]   - Right now I'm bouncing literally.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.460]   - Oh, see, yeah, you're not--
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.300]   - Look at this.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.140]   - There's no bouncing.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.300]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.660]   So Alex, do you think that's because
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:30.820]   of the six axis features now?
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.660]   - Yeah. - The gyro?
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.300]   You think the gyro's doing that?
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.300]   - Look at that, you can see how much I'm moving it
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.900]   and you can see what's happening in the screen.
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:40.020]   - Wow, that's really good looking.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.100]   - So that's what's really good.
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.940]   I think a lot of us thought it was gonna be
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.140]   this crazy shaky cam that wasn't gonna work.
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.500]   And what they did by adding that stabilization
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.220]   from those gyros, being able to reverse that,
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.700]   I think that what you're getting is a super
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.220]   smooth and crisp image.
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.300]   - So I can cancel the steady cam Merlin that I ordered?
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.020]   - I know, I know, I'm like, you know,
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.620]   an owl on a handheld is gonna look like a steady cam.
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.820]   - What you know we're gonna do,
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.300]   we're gonna have Tom Merritt FaceTime us.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:13.740]   There we go, look at that.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.580]   Tom Merritt.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:19.540]   And let me turn it sideways so that you see the aspect ratio
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.300]   changes depending on how you're holding the phone.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.340]   So he's holding the phone in portrait mode
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.540]   if he changes to landscape.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.260]   - And if I do that,
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.340]   (mumbles)
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.500]   - And this is your iPhone.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.980]   Yeah!
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.260]   Sorry, I'm just gonna try to stay calm here.
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.620]   My Nexus one is starting to rust.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:39.820]   - They were very nice about it,
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:40.940]   they were very, very helpful.
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.260]   And the guy actually gave me a bad ache
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:45.740]   because he's like, I don't want security
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.900]   to give you a hard time 'cause he didn't act about.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.660]   - Wow, that's awesome.
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.220]   So presumably I can connect that up
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.420]   and activate it to my existing iPhone number.
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.740]   Look at that.
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.260]   - Yeah, and yours was cheaper than mine.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:03.780]   Because I had to pay the activation fee.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.780]   And yours was just the straight,
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.140]   you know, unsubsidized price.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.020]   - Wow.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.780]   Well, this is great, Tom.
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.180]   This is your first FaceTime call, what do you think?
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:20.460]   - It's pretty cool, although I still don't see you.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.300]   I just see-- - No, that's 'cause
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.820]   of where the camera is.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:24.700]   I'll point it at me and--
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.820]   - Oh, there we go, there we go.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't see the--
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.980]   You see, it's just the nature of this is that I do.
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.500]   - Right, right, 'cause you're trying to--
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.940]   There's Leo, I see him.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.780]   - Yeah, yeah, but then--
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:36.180]   - How does it look on your side, right?
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:41.180]   - Your image is slightly blocky.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.180]   - Yeah, no, we're getting quite a good image.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.020]   - What's that bad?
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.180]   - Is that Roger Chang behind you?
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.980]   - No, that's Tony.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:51.780]   - Tony Wang, Roger Chang, I get confused sometimes.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.620]   - One of--
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:55.900]   You know, I have a hard time keeping them straight myself.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.820]   Look at that.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:01.020]   - Yeah, so this line, here I'm gonna go walk along
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.580]   the line here.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.900]   Hey Tony, can you hold that?
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:04.740]   - Quality's really great.
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:05.980]   - Tony's holding like 700 bags,
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.100]   and I just gave him one more.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.380]   - Look how good the sound is from that.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:11.500]   - It's gonna walk along, this is the line of people
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.100]   who are waiting first come for serve.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.300]   And as you can see, it stretches indefinitely.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:22.060]   I realize my audio got choppy because I walked away
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.420]   from the Apple store and my--
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:24.340]   - Yeah, you figured that out.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.660]   - Yes, exactly done.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:26.500]   - Yeah.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.220]   And the orientation keeps changing on me.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.820]   I'm just gonna leave it.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.820]   - So I don't know if you could see that,
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:32.660]   but that's--
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:34.260]   - Just like an iPad, by the way, that's why.
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.020]   - It's a 360 degree revolution, which is kind of--
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:41.380]   Sorry.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.940]   - Yeah, as I was walking.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.420]   - This is great though, I have to say,
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.580]   really remarkable.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.220]   - So yeah, this is cool, I like it in the FaceTime.
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.060]   I'm a...
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.500]   - Dr. Mom is telling me that she was told that the man has--
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.260]   - I think I'm gonna head out now and...
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:06.740]   Just come here, bring me my phone, bring me my--
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.860]   - Yes, I'm going to--
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:12.500]   I'm gonna jump in the car, put the siren on top--
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.340]   - Yes.
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.540]   - And race north to bring you your phone.
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:16.820]   - That's what I go, test, test, test.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.340]   - Yeah, now we got you.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:20.580]   All right, so--
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.540]   Hey, how you doing, Liam?
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:22.980]   - I'm great, Brian, thank you for doing this
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.620]   and just that short notice.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.460]   - Oh, sure, you got it, man.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.300]   What's funny is I was bummed because I couldn't connect
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.300]   to the hotel Wi-Fi with the iPhone 4,
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.100]   and I was like, well, I guess there's no way to make it work,
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.100]   and then all of a sudden it hit me that I'm sitting
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.460]   in front of a computer that Skype enabled.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:42.380]   So I just got my phone,
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:45.860]   and I knew that there were phones that had a yellowing
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.660]   or discoloration on it, there's a gizmodo article,
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.780]   where apparently they're keeping a log of everything,
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.300]   45 units accounting they said,
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:57.460]   where it's visible in the lower left-hand corner,
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.140]   and in order to see it, you need to, there we go.
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:03.740]   We'll see, I'm gonna see if it's detectable on--
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:05.420]   - The camera's pretty yellow as it is,
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.060]   but let's see if we can see,
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.700]   hold it up a little bit, what we'll hire.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:15.020]   - In that corner right there, when I drag it over,
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.540]   I don't know if it's showing up there or not.
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.220]   - We're not really seeing, to pull it back a little bit,
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.380]   'cause it can't focus, it's so close.
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:22.460]   - There you go.
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:28.540]   But basically it just looks like a yellow discoloration,
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:30.580]   there are plenty of photos of it online.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:31.420]   I mean, it's--
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.300]   - Yeah, we've seen it on Jason Googrady's Power Page,
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.140]   so I have seen it.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.700]   - But I tell you, one of the things,
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:39.300]   if you want to see whether or not you have it,
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.980]   because it's completely undetectable from the home screen,
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:44.020]   anytime there's a busy pattern on there,
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.100]   you're not gonna be able to tell
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.740]   that there's any kind of discoloration,
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.180]   because you don't know what the color should look like,
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.180]   if you go to some screen that's gray,
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:52.540]   it doesn't show up when it's all white,
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.820]   it doesn't show up when it's all black,
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.140]   but if you do a gray screen,
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.460]   you'll be able to really see
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:57.940]   if there's a banding on the side
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.300]   or a discoloration in the corner.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.300]   And it wasn't until I was halfway through
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.660]   installing TweetDeck that I noticed it.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:05.500]   - That's right.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.060]   - And it really popped out at me.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.220]   And I had, I thought about walking right back inside
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.860]   and asking for another unit,
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:15.020]   but number one, Apple has this delightful policy,
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:18.020]   if not accepting walkups for their genius service.
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.220]   And so I'd have to make some kind of,
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.620]   you know, some kind of appointment.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.380]   But my guess is, is that there's a decent chance
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.380]   that I'll just get back another unit
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.460]   that has the same problem.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:29.380]   I mean, these are all brand new units
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.780]   then that have the discoloration on the screen.
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:34.300]   So my plan right now is to just use it for a week or so
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:37.220]   and then swap it out because it's covered under warranty,
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.060]   I'd imagine that I could come back anytime.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.620]   - What, MacRumors.com is saying now,
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.740]   my suspicion was this was the bonding agent
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:47.300]   that's laminating the glass to the LCD panel.
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.060]   We've seen they have an unusual way of doing that.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:49.900]   And I was thinking,
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.780]   perhaps the glue was slightly visible.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:56.260]   And what MacRumors is saying is that a number,
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:59.060]   there have been some forum posts at Apple Insider
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:04.060]   that say that it resolves itself as the bonding agent dries.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:06.340]   - That's interesting.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:09.140]   - So the Apple's using a bonding agent called
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:14.140]   OrganofunctionalSilaneZ-6011.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.780]   - And it's-- - And yeah.
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.260]   - Well, everybody who's used that bonding agent
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.780]   really well knows that--
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.180]   - The bonding agent has had a reputation
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.700]   ever since grade school in the old.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.540]   - Yeah, come on.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.540]   - It was trouble waiting to happen.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.180]   - Ken Shepherds, you're telling us,
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:31.340]   we stopped using that here.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.300]   - Oh yeah, yes, absolutely.
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.300]   - Okay, for that reason.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:36.100]   So there is, it's a well known evaporation issue
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.820]   and it just takes a little extra time.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.140]   So what it's really telling us is that they're shipping
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:44.500]   these things out as fast as they can make them.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.740]   - Yeah. - So watch.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.100]   - Yes.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:49.900]   - My guess is that from a publicity and a PR standpoint,
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.620]   it may even be worth it for them to knowingly send out
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:56.300]   units of questionable, you know, and I'm,
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.420]   keep in mind, this in no way do I know this or whatever,
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.940]   but when I put on my pretending I'm Apple hat,
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:04.220]   if I'm Apple, I'm moving these things as fast as I can
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:07.700]   and we'll see number one who notices the discoloration
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.580]   because it's perfectly functional.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:12.340]   You have complete resolution, you have complete use of it
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.340]   and it only shows up really when you have
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.940]   a perfectly gray slate background.
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.500]   So I'm getting them out as fast as I can
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.060]   and I figure I'll just swap out the units when they come back
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.860]   and then that'll be the source of all the refurb parts
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.820]   for units down the road.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.260]   - Right, right.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:30.340]   Well, maybe when we do the tear down a little later
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:33.260]   with iPhone repair, we'll be able to see what's going on there.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.900]   But I would say before you rush to get it back,
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.220]   'cause I know you wanna use your iPhone for,
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:41.860]   you might wanna see if it fixes itself.
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:43.060]   Where are you right now?
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:44.580]   What town are you in?
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.020]   - I'm in Nashua, New Hampshire.
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:47.940]   I had a show that this, in fact,
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:50.180]   I've been listening to the coverage all morning long,
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.020]   which is very meta.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.220]   It's been very awesome to sit in the chat room,
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.740]   listening to the Twit Live coverage
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.180]   while I'm in the chat room.
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:59.740]   And I had to take out my ear plugs and stop listening to you
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.260]   because the person in the line next to me interrupted me
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:03.260]   like, excuse me, excuse me.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.380]   I'm like, yeah, did anyone ever tell you
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:08.420]   that you were a dead ringer for Brian Rushwood?
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:10.820]   - You're a little thinner and better looking,
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:14.060]   but otherwise you could be Brian Rushwood.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:14.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:15.900]   - Yeah.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.340]   - But I think Nashua, New Hampshire is a very small town
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.460]   and I'm in here for college,
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:23.060]   which by the way, tomorrow I've gotta get up at 6 a.m.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.060]   and fly all the way out to San Francisco
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.740]   for the five year revision three party.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.420]   - Oh, that's gonna be a massive party.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.260]   I wish I could go to that.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.540]   I'm at food camp tomorrow night.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.220]   I'm locked in a room.
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.060]   I know.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:34.940]   - I was thinking it would be a great opportunity
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.420]   for round two of crowd surfing.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.260]   Get you out theory.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.260]   - I would love to do that.
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.140]   Well, now the next stage is perhaps launched.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:45.380]   We're talking right now with the Army's Golden Knights.
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:48.580]   Callie Lewis has arranged, it's not definite yet,
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:53.580]   but for a live streaming parachute jump in Dallas.
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.300]   - You got the bearing, the live wearing the live
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.460]   you backpack and everything?
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.460]   - I don't, it's my sense that it will not work,
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.020]   but we're investigating.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:00.860]   Let's put it that way.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:02.660]   - Well, regardless, I mean, you'll take video of it.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:03.340]   You'll take video. - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:04.260]   There's lots of video
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.140]   and I'll have a helmet cam and so forth.
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.940]   But what we really would like to do is stream it.
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:09.780]   - Yeah, dude.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.740]   Well, I tell you what, the magician in me?
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:12.820]   (crowd cheering)
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:13.660]   What?
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:15.540]   (crowd cheering)
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.540]   What is happening?
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.940]   - Oh my God, you've crossed, you've crossed the beams.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.780]   Oh my God.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:21.620]   I,
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:22.620]   (laughs)
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.540]   - All right, next door today.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.380]   - Just to know.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:27.620]   - That was weird.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.300]   - Sorry about that boss. (laughs)
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:30.860]   Hey Brian, go back to work.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:32.500]   I know you and Chad are working on
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.980]   some amazing illusions for tonight's performance.
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.900]   Everybody should check out the revision three,
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.340]   or five year anniversary party,
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.380]   which is tomorrow night in San Francisco.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.020]   Is it open to the public?
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.220]   - You know, it is open to the public,
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.140]   but it's 21 and over.
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.580]   Expect a long line if you show up in person,
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.900]   but we will be live streaming the entire event.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.620]   In fact, I just confirmed that after my stage show,
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:56.060]   I'll be hosting the stream for my thing 10 until 10.30.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.260]   - Oh, that's exciting.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:58.100]   So this is kind of,
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.540]   you've never been to a live dignity nation.
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:02.380]   This is really a bunch of fun.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:03.220]   Highly recommend. - Oh my God.
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.780]   - You know, it's the closest any of us tech heads
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.340]   get to being totally punk rock.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.100]   I mean, this is, like I said last time,
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:09.980]   that's South by Southwest,
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:11.220]   that's our Woodstock moment,
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.220]   where we're all together doing our geek thing.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:14.580]   - Oh yeah, very cool.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:15.620]   I'm looking on revision three.
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:19.540]   I don't see anything about this live event,
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.220]   so I don't know if it's maybe gotten just too full.
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.060]   - Yeah, you know,
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.100]   if you follow the revision three Twitter feed,
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.380]   I'm sure it'll show up, but you know,
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:31.860]   you're right, I actually don't know the location of it myself.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.700]   All I know is that I gotta make it San Francisco in time,
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.620]   and everything will be fine.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:38.140]   - Revision three, I'm told revision3.com,
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.700]   R-E-V-I-S-I-O-N, the number three.com/the number five,
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.900]   Y-E-A-R, will take you to the five year anniversary page.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.100]   - Division3.com/fiveyear, awesome.
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:49.940]   - There you go. - I'll see you guys
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:50.740]   there tomorrow then.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:51.820]   - Hey, thanks a lot.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.260]   Have a great time, Brian Rushwood.
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:54.100]   - And by the way,
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.420]   I gotta give credit to pretty jumbles who just texted me,
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.900]   reminding me that while it is a yellow blotch on my screen,
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.420]   it is by far the highest resolution yellow blotch
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.980]   I've ever had the privilege to see on the screen.
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.220]   - Thanks, Brian Rushwood.
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.380]   Great to talk to you.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.540]   And have a great show tonight,
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.940]   and we'll see you tomorrow in San Francisco.
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:11.780]   Take care. - Okay.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.220]   - Bye-bye.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.060]   - What are you looking at?
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:14.900]   Tom Merritt?
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.420]   Come here, my friend.
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:19.260]   Come here.
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:20.540]   I gotta give you a big hug.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.380]   - I guess something.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.060]   - Yeah, you're wrong.
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:23.980]   (laughing)
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.500]   - Oh, baby, come to Papa.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.940]   - Thank Pat at the Apple.
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.260]   - Thank you, Pat at the Apple Store.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.060]   We won't use the last name on that one.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:31.900]   No, thank you, Tom.
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.100]   And I guess we need to give Tom a check.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:34.940]   - No.
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:36.460]   (laughing)
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.300]   - Good to meet you.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.660]   - That's awesome.
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.780]   Well, I, you know, I have another one coming in three weeks,
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:43.460]   but I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.820]   I'll activate this one with the other phone,
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:47.740]   and we'll figure that out when the time comes.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:50.260]   Let me see the back panel there.
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.300]   So that's just glass.
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.460]   - Yeah, it's actually glassing.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:56.420]   Kind of composite there.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.260]   - And, you know, they're doing this lamination.
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:01.780]   I mean, the glass has virtually no thickness.
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.300]   - Yeah, it's very thin.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.820]   - It's very thin.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.740]   - Yeah.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:08.740]   As you can see, but it's not so thin that it can't break.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:10.660]   It can absolutely break.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:13.940]   And then, what else?
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:14.900]   Oh, look, that's interesting.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.300]   It has a little twit logo.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.100]   Where was that in the iPhone?
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.300]   - It's right here in the minute.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.460]   (laughing)
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:21.300]   - Tom, what are you doing?
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.260]   - I've got a little sling box app going.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.340]   - Oh, watchin' a little dong.
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.180]   - Watchin' a little dong.
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.300]   - Off the DVR.
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:28.260]   - That's awesome.
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:30.460]   - Our friends at Sling.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:35.380]   Thank you, Jay, and David and all the gang over at Sling.
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:40.780]   For supporting our live coverage of our iPhone 4 launch.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:42.100]   I'll say it one more time.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:44.540]   You can watch your favorite TV shows
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.260]   when you're away from home with Sling box,
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:48.060]   just like Tom's doing right now.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.660]   You can do it on iPhones and the new one too.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:53.580]   iPod touches with Wi-Fi, Blackberry,
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:54.820]   of course your Mac and Windows laptops,
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:57.620]   and now the new Android mobile.
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.900]   And everybody's sayin' this is an awesome version
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.140]   of the Sling application.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:04.020]   Here's the deal, here's how it works.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.820]   You go to Best Buy, you purchase a Sling box,
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:09.100]   you bring it home, you hook up your Sling box to your TV.
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:13.220]   I moved, I moved my cable over.
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.380]   I just had the guy, he just finished movin' everything over
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:18.740]   to where the ethernet is 'cause I want that Sling box
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:19.900]   to connect it up to the,
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.100]   that's why I can't show you right now
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.660]   'cause I haven't connected it yet.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:24.700]   Packed it up to the Sling box HD,
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.820]   connect the ethernet up there,
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.500]   and now boom, anywhere I am,
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:31.580]   I can watch my TV, even from other rooms.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.860]   I'm can't wait for the iPad app
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.060]   'cause then basically this is a portable television.
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:36.140]   I can bring this anywhere.
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:37.700]   - Oh cool, thanks man.
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.420]   - Find an in-store demo to Best Buy near you,
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:43.060]   just visit Slingbox.com, and they'll tell you where to go.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:47.220]   And we thank Sling box for providing our live coverage
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.780]   of the iPhone 4 launch.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.360]   (upbeat music)
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:56.360]   - Oh, a lot of fun covering that iPhone launch.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.560]   That's something that we've started doing a lot of on Twitch
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.760]   and I hope to do a lot more of on Twitch Live.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.680]   If you only download the shows,
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.920]   you're missing out at live.twit.tv
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.640]   when there's breaking tech news.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.280]   More and more, we're gonna try to be there
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.880]   and covering it, and especially product launches.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.840]   Not only do we do the iPhone 4 launches,
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.240]   you just saw, but we did the Windows Phone 7 launch.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.880]   We did a number of Facebook announcements,
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.600]   a number of Google announcements, Google TV announcements,
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.520]   and that's been a lot of fun,
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.960]   and I expect to do a lot more of that.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:29.960]   So mostly what's happening is Twitch's not just the podcast,
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.280]   but there's also this Twitch Live component
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.360]   that's kind of, I'm thinking of it as the CNN of tech.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.400]   So conferences are coming up,
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.840]   we're gonna be doing CES just a week from now.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.000]   Can I believe that'd be possible?
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   When is it start June 7th?
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.600]   Fifth, our coverage of the consumer electronic show in Vegas.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.200]   We're gonna be down there en masse as we were this year.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.120]   Also, South by Southwest is coming up in March,
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.160]   and I think it's not certain yet.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.720]   Now, so I'm not gonna say anything,
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.280]   but I think we've got another big conference
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.560]   we're gonna be covering in February.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:05.480]   It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.960]   So that's another part of a Twitch
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.800]   that we're very proud of as we expand the network.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.560]   We wanna bring you more live coverage
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:15.160]   of major tech events like announcements and conferences.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.280]   All right, we're gonna come back in just a little bit.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.600]   We've actually got another great moment
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.880]   from a Mac break weekly, right?
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.040]   Oh yeah, we're gonna do the Mac world,
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.600]   visit to Mac world.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.440]   Oh, that's right.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.960]   This year in Mac world Expo went off in February.
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:34.560]   I took over from David Pogan, Mac world live.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.080]   So we're gonna see a little bit of that,
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.200]   including Adam Savage from the Mythbusters.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.120]   Before we get to that though,
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.800]   I wanna talk a little bit about Ford
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:43.720]   and the great Eileen's just sitting off camera going,
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.920]   go to the commercial, go to the commercial.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:50.840]   Talk about the great Ford Sync.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:54.440]   You have, if you've never driven a Ford with Ford Sync,
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.520]   you've got to try it.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.720]   Ford Lincoln or Mercury vehicles.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.120]   I got the 2010 Mustang, as you know,
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.440]   I'm a big Ford Sync fan.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.600]   You get in the car, your music starts playing.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.440]   I play it off of my Bluetooth phone.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:08.360]   I've got the new Nexus S, the Android phone.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.800]   But you know what's fun about the Ford Sync,
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.280]   there's the Nexus S, is that you could,
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.960]   I don't know how much, I've got about a dozen phones now,
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.560]   including my son's phone, my wife's phone,
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.760]   my daughter's phone, all paired with the Ford Sync.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.520]   And I could say which one is my preferred phone,
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.080]   but one could be the phone phone,
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.720]   one could be the audio source.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.880]   I've even used my iPad, the Bluetooth on the iPad,
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.360]   works great for an audio source.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.680]   So you can listen to whatever's on your devices.
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:36.080]   Of course, it's also got a USB port,
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.080]   so you can connect your device via USB to the Ford Sync.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.560]   And on iPods, it actually indexes it
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.800]   and puts it up on the screen,
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.200]   or it lets you ask for the songs by name.
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.520]   So you could say play AC/DC Hell's Bells,
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.320]   and it'll play it.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.440]   That's for you, Lisa.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.560]   So, the AC/DC fan over there.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.400]   So I'm just a big fan of Ford Sync.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.360]   It also of course has turn-by-turn directions,
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.360]   even if you don't get the GPS screen, the big package,
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:08.280]   it will walk you through your drive, step-by-step,
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.640]   even reroute you if there's traffic conditions
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.520]   along the route, you could get movie times.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.840]   My favorite, I love when I'm doing a demo of Ford Sync,
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.160]   and I seem to do it almost every day.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.360]   People get in the car and say,
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.200]   all right, what's that?
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.240]   And I say, well, watch this.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.200]   And I can say, "Bing, I press the,
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.520]   "you never take your eyes off the wheel,
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.280]   "or your eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.480]   "You know, you're driving along.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.080]   "Bing, you press the button."
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.840]   And it says, "I say fuel prices."
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.920]   And it finds the best fuel price nearby,
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.000]   and then it gives you directions there.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.080]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.320]   It is really a fantastic technology.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.280]   Here's how you find out more.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:46.480]   Either go to your local Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.440]   and say, "I want to test drive."
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.560]   You know, they have this funny thing about you
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.960]   test driving vehicles.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.440]   So say, you know, pick a vehicle, but then you test,
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.960]   make sure it has synch in it and you test drive
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:59.800]   the Ford Sync, or you go to syncmyridepodcast.com,
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.160]   you could try it out.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.160]   By the way, before we go, I do want to mention
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.040]   the contest is almost over.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.560]   December 31st is your last day.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.000]   If you're watching this in 2011,
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.440]   I'm sorry you missed the boat,
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.480]   but if it's not the end of the year yet
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.640]   when you're watching this,
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.200]   you have to go to twitfordfocus.com.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.600]   They're looking for a two, it's a Facebook page.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.800]   So you have to be a Facebook member and like the page.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:25.400]   Then they're looking for two minute video
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:29.400]   about why one, you should go to Madrid, Spain,
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:33.480]   to be one of the first to test drive the 2012 Ford Focus.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.680]   How about that?
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.320]   And then also, as if that weren't enough,
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.800]   they'll give $10,000 to the charity
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.600]   of your choice, you have to say why, which charity,
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.760]   why you want to give $10,000 to it.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.880]   $500,000 in total, Ford is giving away.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:47.920]   I am really looking forward to,
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:50.520]   we don't know the date yet of this test drive in Madrid,
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.400]   but I just got a direct message on Twitter from Scott Monay
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.800]   who said, all right Leo, all right,
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.920]   stop lobbying, you're going, yes!
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:00.920]   So you'll join me and a bunch of other great people
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.840]   in Madrid at the Spanish National Testing Center
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.800]   to be one of the first, isn't that great?
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.000]   So if you want to enter the contest,
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   twitfordfocus.com, make that two minute video,
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.360]   read the instructions, you gotta do it by December 31st, 2010.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.840]   A tip of the, whatever this is, cap, I guess.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.720]   A tip of the pom-pom to our good friends at Ford
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.240]   for being such great supporters of Twit all year long.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.120]   We look forward to a great 2011
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.560]   with Ford and all of our sponsors.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.120]   And of course, most importantly, with you.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.400]   Let's get back to the best of Mac Break Weekly,
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.600]   and we're gonna go right now to Macworld Live
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.320]   and some great performances, including Mythbusters,
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.040]   Adam Savage, let's watch.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:50.920]   Our next guest is a new friend to me,
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.920]   but I know we've all watched him on TV
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:55.240]   and he's a true and utter geek.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.240]   You've seen him on Mythbusters.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.040]   Let's give a warm welcome to Adam Savage, please.
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:03.040]   (audience applauds)
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:06.040]   (audience applauds)
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:09.480]   - So nice to see you.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.040]   Thanks for coming, have a seat.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.040]   - Thank you.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:12.880]   (audience applauds)
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.720]   - Hello.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:14.720]   - Hi, how are you?
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:16.640]   - It was so much fun backstage,
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.640]   'cause there's just a bunch of geeks
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.800]   like all the other phones out there talking about stuff.
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:20.800]   - The green room's where it's at.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.320]   - The green room was hot and happening, let me tell you.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.000]   So I'm such a big fan, everybody's a big fan of yours.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.960]   How long has Mythbusters been on there? A long time.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:28.960]   - Seven years?
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.800]   - It's amazing.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.720]   - 180 hours of programming.
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:32.560]   - The thing that, look.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.400]   - Yeah, pretty good.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.520]   Now this is not your first exposure to TV though,
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.320]   'cause I looked on Wikipedia.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:39.120]   (audience laughs)
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.640]   Okay, you were Mr. Whipple's stock boy
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.360]   in a Charmin commercial, is that right?
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.440]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.520]   (audience laughs)
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.280]   I told my dad when I was 15 that I wanted to be an actor,
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.520]   and a good friend of his was somebody hired
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.000]   for commercials way back in the '70s,
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.200]   Charlie Kimbro, who ended up playing Jim Dine
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.280]   on Murphy Brown.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.120]   - Oh yeah.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.600]   - And Charlie got me my first agent,
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.400]   and my agent sent me out on a call,
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.600]   and I got my first audition,
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.280]   which was playing Mr. Whipple's stock boy.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.280]   - I'm gonna jump.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.760]   - I played Jimmy the stock boy.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.040]   - Now we looked, and we looked,
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.120]   and we could not find a clip.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.280]   I'm sure you have clips somewhere.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.440]   - Oh, you know it's out there,
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.200]   I think I just sent somebody to it the other way.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.600]   - We did find this though.
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.800]   This is a Billy Joel.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.600]   ♪ You got the passion in the storm ♪
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.960]   ♪ All the getting in the rain ♪

[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.200]   - Here he comes.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.800]   - That's him, there you go.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.080]   (laughing)
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.240]   ♪ You're going to be a great girl ♪

[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.720]   - I love Billy Joel.
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.560]   - And so that video--
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.400]   - And so that video-- - By the way,
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.680]   you looked like you were dying out there.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.280]   - It was freezing cold in November in New York.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.880]   I love Billy Joel, but that video is so bad
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.360]   that halfway through my show,
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.560]   you get to my wife, she's like,
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.720]   "Are you in any more of this thing?
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.240]   'Cause I can't take-- - Can we stop now?
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.440]   - Yeah.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.520]   - That's it, that's it.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.160]   Right there, that's the starring role.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:01.760]   - That was, yeah, I did a bunch of commercials for a while.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.400]   I actually went to NYU for a semester.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.840]   I pretended to go to class in drama.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.680]   I thought actually I was gonna be an actor.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.040]   - So how did you get to be a model builder?
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.360]   How did you get to that?
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.760]   - The acting, when you, I had already been going out
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.680]   for auditions for commercials for about five years
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.120]   by the time I was at NYU and I was,
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.440]   I don't know, I got disillusioned and I got out of it.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.600]   I was working in graphic design in New York.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.400]   I ended up moving out to San Francisco,
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.480]   working in theater, the facility with building things
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.200]   led to special effects and then,
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.160]   weirdly, the Mythbusters opportunity came up
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.280]   and it was, that's when the maker of things
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.480]   in the performer come back full circle.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.800]   - Couldn't be better.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.640]   You guys work really hard on that show.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.560]   I did not realize how hard you shoot all the time.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.720]   - We shoot 46 weeks a year.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.800]   - It's unbelievable.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.920]   - We don't have any episodes.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.560]   - We turn on about 21 episodes a year.
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.840]   - So it takes you a couple of weeks.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.480]   You know, actually you can tell when you watch the show
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.920]   that you're really thinking about the stuff,
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.400]   design the stuff, but building it.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.600]   So you go in every day and you're doing that?
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.480]   - Yeah, if you see something built on the show,
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.480]   we built it.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.160]   Unless you're watching someone else build it.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.160]   We don't take credit for stuff that's not ours.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.360]   So we really are still, about two years ago
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.480]   we got someone to help clean up, but that was.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.320]   (laughing)
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.720]   - A big improvement, I'm sure.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.440]   - We really do take pride that it's all of our handiwork
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.400]   and we've got our blood on all the tools.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.640]   - Where do you get the ideas for what you want to test?
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.920]   - There's a never ending stream.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:24.760]   There's a lot of myths.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:26.240]   - I just came up with one the other day,
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.560]   which I couldn't believe, and this happens frequently.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.920]   I can't believe I didn't think of this.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:31.640]   Fat mirror, skinny mirrors.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.200]   - I have a mirror in my bathroom,
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.800]   and I wish it weren't such a good mirror
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.520]   'cause I look so good in that mirror and I stand,
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.640]   I go boy, I look good today,
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.080]   and then I go out in the real world and it does not work.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:44.920]   - Well, see, I'm a fan.
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.120]   I have the last mirror in my bedroom
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.440]   is this full-length mirror and it makes me look fantastic.
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.560]   - Yeah, and I like that.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.760]   - How can we get the world to look like that?
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.280]   - Well, so we want to find out
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.400]   because I have this other mirror in my house,
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.640]   downstairs bathroom mirror,
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.440]   which actually makes me look like a hobbit.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.520]   (laughing)
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.320]   And I make sure to avoid it as if I'm looking for something
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.160]   before I go out.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.000]   - You should have that the last thing
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.120]   as you go out of the house.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.200]   - So I figured that we'd go to a department store,
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.400]   we'd actually start measuring the flatness of the mirrors
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.400]   and seeing if there's some sort of--
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.240]   - So there's some sort of distortion.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:18.400]   - Consistent distortion, laterally, horizontally, diagonally,
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.080]   and then we'd do some experiments in the shop,
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.920]   and then I want to finish by setting up a hall of mirrors
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.720]   in Union Square and having people just go through
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.560]   and pick their favorites and see if there really is--
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.480]   - This is true. - Things you think.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.400]   - Yeah.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.120]   So you try to do a scientific method in what you're doing.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.760]   - That's actually, that's the main thing we try
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:34.840]   and do is the method.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.200]   We realize that our results are often bunk, but--
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.320]   (laughing)
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.400]   - The methodology is good.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:40.880]   - The methodology is sound.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.880]   If we had the time to do this 100 times,
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.680]   we feel the methodology would yield something.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.560]   - So you told me that the one you're working on right now
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.960]   is this slip and slide video.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.040]   - Yeah, yeah, you know the video--
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:49.880]   - We have it.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.720]   - We have it.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:51.560]   - Okay, let's take a look at it.
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.720]   This is a video that was a viral video
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:56.200]   that was making the rounds of a slip and slide,
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.760]   and I fell for it, I saw this and I thought,
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.320]   this is the most amazing thing ever.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.400]   It's on YouTube.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.600]   Here it is, this is the slip and slide video.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:08.080]   It's a, oh, it's a huge one.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.600]   And they put water on it.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.600]   Now, it's not only so big, but look, there's a ramp.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.440]   (laughing)
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:17.440]   He's gonna hit the ramp, he goes in the air,
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.360]   and look, get a little pool.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.440]   (laughing)
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.280]   So.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.520]   (cheering)
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:29.360]   And I watched that a dozen times,
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.560]   and I said, how could they be faking that?
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.200]   - That's, well, so--
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.040]   - It is faking.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.440]   - I won't spoil the surprise, but we are, yeah,
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.880]   we're heading out to a location on Monday to reenact this.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.800]   (laughing)
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.800]   Who's gonna, who's doing the slip?
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.120]   - Well, me, of course.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:45.960]   - You're kidding.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.920]   - Well, Jamie, we're both setting up to do it.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.600]   We both have surfer wetsuits,
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.320]   we're gonna wear latex jumpsuits on top.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.880]   We sent our PA to Mr. S Leathers today to get them.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.760]   And we've got this--
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.920]   - That might be fun to keep around afterwards.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:01.600]   (laughing)
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.320]   - We actually have figured out that our old ones
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:04.240]   are all used up.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.160]   (laughing)
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.640]   The thing is, is looking at this video,
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.520]   is it's not about the distance that he flies,
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.720]   or the speed that he's going.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.400]   Really, it's about accuracy.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.240]   He hits that little--
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.760]   - He hits that tiny little target,
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.520]   so that's what we'll be really looking at.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.120]   And there might be a certain point at which
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.480]   we no longer feel comfortable.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.720]   Our friend Nick Plache, who's our safety guy
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.000]   at a Hollywood stunt coordinator,
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.400]   will be with us. - Good.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.600]   - We're gonna ramp up to it.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.520]   But really, all next week,
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.360]   we're gonna be flying through the air.
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.160]   (laughing)
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.440]   - I mean, it's a great job, but it's also crazy.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.400]   You gotta be nice.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:34.720]   You use Max?
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.560]   - Yes.
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.400]   - Okay, good.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.240]   I should check. - For him.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.080]   - I should have checked before I invited you.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.960]   - No, my, what was your first, Max?
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.200]   - My first, I was just telling,
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:43.720]   so the other night I hosted EFF's 20th, then--
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.920]   - By the way, thank you for doing that.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.640]   Really great, really great.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:50.480]   - You know, at that stage, talking to John Perry Marlow
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.040]   and Mitch K. Poor, which was like, totally intense.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:53.880]   - Yeah.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.040]   - And I've told them, I figured I'd drop some street cred
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.240]   and I said, "Dudes, I read hacker crackdown
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:00.160]   "on my Powerbook 170."
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.280]   - Yeah.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.120]   - Yeah.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.960]   - And they both were like, "Mm, nice."
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:04.960]   "Yo, Jedi."
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.400]   (laughing)
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.320]   Yeah, my first Mac was a Powerbook 170.
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.240]   I bought with a sculpture that I sold
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.440]   at Catherine Clark's Gallery in Hayes Valley.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.280]   - Oh, that's cool.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.680]   Was that the one with the built-in track ball?
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.520]   - Yes. - Had a little ball?
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.960]   - Yes. - Was gray.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.320]   - Yeah, little, kind of--
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.360]   - Little tiny, but it was the active matrix screen.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.880]   Remember how big that was? - It was color, anyway.
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.560]   Yeah. - Then I upgraded that
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:26.960]   to a blackbird to the 520, 520C.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.160]   - Do you use Macs in production?
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.360]   I mean, for script writing-- - Yeah, we're actually
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.320]   doing, we're a solely a Mac shop.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:33.360]   - That's great. - I mean, there's a few PCs
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.400]   around, a lot of the scientific monitoring software
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:39.240]   we use only works on PCs, but now we're,
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:43.480]   several of us are dual booting in order to manage that.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.080]   - If you decide you want to put a computer down
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.840]   in the slip and slide, you can use the PCs.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.240]   Please don't use the Macs.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.080]   (audience laughs)
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.440]   Too painful.
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.720]   So what's, you're just gonna keep doing mythbusters
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.560]   for the rest of your life?
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:55.480]   - Until they lock the door.
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:56.680]   - It's an awfully great job.
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:01.240]   - I mean, amazingly, the success was totally surprising
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.080]   of the show.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.800]   We never set out to make something that was educational.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:07.280]   (audience laughs)
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:09.040]   If we had tried, we would have failed.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.040]   We really are just following our nose as we--
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.760]   - That was the motto of Seinfeld, no teaching, no hugging.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.760]   - I love that. - Yeah.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.920]   - Yeah, no, and you stay true to what the formula is,
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.320]   which is me and Jamie like dogs
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:23.360]   with a rope battling back and forth.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.120]   But for the last six months,
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.320]   we've been the highest rated show on Discovery,
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.240]   and seven years in, that's unheard of.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.240]   - Rightly so.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.080]   - Rightly so.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.400]   - The show is doing great.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:38.280]   We're, we're, we have more of a sense of ownership
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:40.200]   over the material than ever before.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.760]   You know, we have this great brain trust
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.160]   in the middle of me and Jamie
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.880]   and our director, Alice,
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.480]   and our executive producer, Dan Tapster.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:50.280]   And the creative, that creative bond
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.320]   between the four of us is really,
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.720]   really satisfying for all of us.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.160]   And we argue all the time.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.560]   - That's really unusual in mainstream media
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.560]   that you get that kind of,
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.160]   does Discovery never say, let's not do that one?
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:04.840]   - Because we've done so many tasteless things
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.680]   in relatively tasteful ways,
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.200]   (audience laughs)
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.280]   they give us a fairly--
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.120]   - That's great.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.520]   - There's not, the stuff that they get upset about
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.040]   are things that they think are gonna be boring.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:17.680]   I've been pitching a audio file episode forever.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.240]   I wanna do high end speaker cable against my board.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.360]   - Yes, yes.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.240]   - I wanna prove that you don't have to spray.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.400]   - You don't have to be 50 bucks on a goddamn HDMI cable.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.240]   - Yeah.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.440]   - I get them at mono price for $3, right?
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.280]   - Exactly.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280]   - Yeah.
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.440]   - The green around the CDs, remember that?
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:36.040]   I wanted, and I actually concocted,
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.320]   I thought this was a great finale.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:39.440]   They not only record versus CD,
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:41.640]   but versus MP3 at different compression rates.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:43.520]   And also in your car, in your house,
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:44.680]   and in his concert hall,
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:47.640]   'cause all three of those are gonna yield different results.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.200]   They're all gonna yield different levels
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.440]   of satisfaction to different people.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:53.880]   - I had my eyes up and I was walking in San Francisco
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:56.280]   by Dolby Labs one day, and that guy kind of said,
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:58.040]   "Hey, Leo, come here."
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:59.240]   And he pulled me, I'm not kidding,
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.280]   he pulled me into Dolby Labs,
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.360]   never met this guy in my life.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.760]   He said, "I wanna play you something."
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.680]   And they have an anecho, a chamber,
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.600]   a perfect sound studio in there
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.400]   with rebel speakers, very high end,
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.440]   you know, $100,000 speakers.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.200]   And he said, "Okay, listen to this.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.680]   "One of these is an MP3, and one of these is the CD,
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:18.040]   "and I could not tell the difference."
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:18.880]   Could not tell.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:19.720]   Do you agree, Roger?
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.880]   I mean, you record your stuff as MP3s.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.680]   - I have artifacts in MP3.
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.520]   - You can hear?
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.560]   - Yeah, I can hear some stuff.
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.320]   It's not as good a CD quality.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.640]   I know when I record the stuff for the folktown,
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.600]   I do it at 48 kilohertz, 24-bit,
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.720]   and when it comes out as an MP3,
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.120]   it doesn't have the presence or the ordinary.
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:38.960]   It's not as clear.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.960]   - I saw a study that said that real music has an emote,
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.920]   that the overtones in the real music
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.840]   have an emotional component that is emotional component
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.000]   that's stripped out.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.520]   See, I don't know how you'd measure that.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.320]   Somebody crying when they would measure it.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.840]   (laughing)
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:58.520]   - Every time I see these like $25,000 turntables,
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.640]   or the-- - Oh yeah, with sandbags
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:01.480]   and yeah.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:04.640]   - They're inventing some new way to describe gold
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:05.640]   coating, you know.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:07.440]   - This is a high-quality clothing.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.240]   I've done it in a vacuum with virgins.
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.560]   (laughing)
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:13.280]   - And unicorn tears, he always has the unicorn tears.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.640]   - It's so great to meet you, Adam,
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:15.960]   and thank you for your great success.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.480]   Thank you for being here today, we really appreciate it.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:24.240]   - Actually, let's quickly do a,
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:27.360]   I'll do a quick recap of the latest.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:30.640]   It started, of course, a couple of weeks ago,
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:32.320]   when Engadget first showed pictures,
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.440]   and then Gizmodo claimed to have possession
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.920]   of the fourth generation iPhone,
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:38.760]   the provenance of which is somewhat cloudy,
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:41.920]   but Gizmodo says it was lost by an Apple engineer
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.960]   at a Hofbrow, he was drinking during his birthday.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.680]   Someone found it, looked for the owner, couldn't find him,
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.840]   so then offered it in sequence to Engadget and Gizmodo.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.000]   Gizmodo's Nick Denton from Gawker says,
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.720]   "He paid $5,000 for the phone.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.400]   "Jason Chen did a number of stories on it,
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.600]   "including pictures, took it apart."
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.520]   Apple wrote a letter saying, "I want it, we want it back."
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.640]   Gizmodo apparently gave it back.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.320]   Then the newest news, Friday,
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:14.320]   detectives from React, which is a high tech law enforcement
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:18.160]   team that is composed of a number of different agencies
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.400]   in the Silicon Valley.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.520]   About eight, 30 at night, raided Jason Chen's home.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:28.960]   Jason and his wife came home to find law enforcement in there.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.040]   They said they'd been there for a couple of hours.
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:34.800]   He showed him a letter that Gawker's COO and council,
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.280]   Chief Counsel had given him saying
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.760]   that he was covered by the shield laws,
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.000]   the detective confiscated that,
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.080]   along with four computers, his business cards.
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.640]   I'm not sure why his business cards,
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.880]   his iPad, a lot of material from his house.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.400]   They've taken off with material.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:55.400]   Gawker says, still it says, "We're protected by shield laws."
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:58.400]   Big debate, of course, on the internet.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.680]   When this news came out, by the way,
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.640]   didn't come out until Monday, over A,
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.000]   whether a crime was committed by Gizmodo,
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.960]   the detectives say, from the San Mateo police,
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:12.080]   for say that they are not investigating,
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.120]   or they are accusing Jason or Gizmodo
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:18.080]   of any criminal act they're investigating.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.160]   All they're doing is investigating.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:24.200]   Are those the facts, Denise, pretty much?
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:25.240]   - Yeah, pretty good.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.080]   There, Leo.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.080]   - My best.
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:31.120]   - The React Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team,
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:33.280]   I almost expect Kip from Knight Rider
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.240]   to be pulling up to Jason's house.
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:36.360]   - I'm kidding.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.000]   - With these guys.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.520]   And one little detail that I think is kind of an interesting
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.480]   and important one is I don't think the letter
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.440]   that you're referring to that Gizmodo published on its blog,
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:50.240]   their response to the search warrant,
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.960]   was after the fact.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.680]   - He had an email from--
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:55.000]   - Right, right, right, right, right,
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.880]   which I think is really interesting
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.240]   because somehow, Gawker had noticed
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.880]   that this was going down.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:04.480]   When do the police ever give you notice
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.040]   that they're going to search your home
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:08.320]   with a criminal search warrant?
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:09.920]   - Does this seem unusually proactive?
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:12.200]   I mean, if I were the Chief Counsel,
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.280]   I might, knowing that the shield laws are,
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.480]   by the way, the shield laws say,
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.720]   do they not, that you should have a written letter saying,
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.040]   I'm protected by the shield laws in your possession?
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.720]   - I don't know that, I don't know that.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.520]   - I actually don't know that off the top.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:28.760]   - I read that and I was looking at the codes,
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.480]   and I think it's the California code.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.240]   And I believe it said something to the effect
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:38.240]   of upon written notice, they're supposed to withdraw.
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.520]   - There's something we need to parse here though,
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:43.480]   because the shield law is getting confused here.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.600]   - There's two laws.
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.800]   - Right, the other law is the law
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:49.280]   that governs issuing a search warrant
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:52.840]   for whatever may be in your home.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:56.240]   And that's the one that's actually at issue here.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.760]   There is an exception to that law that says
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:03.680]   that if you're going to go after a warrant,
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:06.640]   it cannot be under the circumstances
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:10.800]   and it cannot be for the items specified in the shield law.
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:13.280]   So the shield law is brought in indirectly.
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.440]   The shield law comes up in the Valerie
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.120]   Plame Judith Miller kind of circumstance, right?
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:20.680]   - So that's the case with Judith Miller,
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.680]   New York Times journalist knew the identity of Valerie Plame
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.840]   and actually had revealed the identity of Valerie Plame.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.800]   - Right, covert CIA agents.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.360]   - Refusing to reveal her sources
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.040]   and went to prison for that.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.000]   - Right, she was held in contempt
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.160]   for not revealing her sources.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.480]   And that's typically what happens.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:46.160]   And that's what shield laws are supposed to guard against.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:47.760]   So they're part of the evidence code.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.520]   They govern what evidence can come in at trial.
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:53.680]   What we're talking now about is part of the penal code
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.520]   that governs when a search warrant can issue.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.880]   And I don't see any exception to this part
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.640]   of the penal code that says,
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:05.440]   oh, if you're investigating a crime involving the journalist,
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:10.280]   then it's okay to go ahead and issue the warrant anyway.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:11.760]   - That's where the debate comes down.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:12.600]   - Right.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.520]   - There's, you know, look at a judge,
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.520]   we didn't see the affidavit that prompted the warrant,
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.120]   but a judge did issue the warrant.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.320]   It was a search warrant that was being executed.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.280]   Presumably the judge knows the law.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.680]   And so there's two possible reasons
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.000]   the judge might have issued that warrant.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.320]   One, because she didn't feel that Jason Chen was a journalist
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.520]   or that his place of residence didn't reflect,
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:35.440]   wasn't a journalistic place of business, right?
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.080]   That would be one exception.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.640]   The other would be what that,
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.600]   there are some limited criminal activities
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.400]   that can be going on there.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.480]   - Well, but the smart, my--
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.520]   - My definition, my definition of confusion is that,
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.760]   I mean, I'm a journalist, but if I steal a car,
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:51.160]   that doesn't mean that they can't enter my residence
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.560]   and find out how I stole that car.
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:53.520]   - Well, what about that Denise?
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:54.360]   Is that the case?
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.720]   By the way, let's assume you're in California,
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:58.000]   and because the laws are different in every state.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.720]   - I'm sorry, just to qualify.
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:02.440]   Every time I look at the papers have been filed
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.520]   and the arguments about it,
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:06.080]   they're about the idea of a journalist's right
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.040]   not to divulge a source for a news story.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.520]   My area of confusion is that it seems to me
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.400]   as though this is possible,
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.680]   they're not trying to get him to give up the source,
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.200]   but they're trying to figure out where you paid $5,000
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.680]   for property that may or may not have been stolen.
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:24.640]   We want to basically investigate you
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:27.040]   on the transfer of that stolen property.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:27.880]   So that's where I'm--
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.440]   - Oh, also, wait, hold on, I want the attorney to answer.
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.880]   - Sure, so you're absolutely right
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:37.960]   that what they're engaged in is a criminal investigation here.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.120]   They're not engaged in trying to make Jason
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:43.480]   or anybody else divulge their sources in court,
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:46.040]   which is what the shield law applies to.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:47.560]   But the question then becomes,
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:50.400]   well, how can you go about that criminal investigation?
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.320]   Well, you can issue search warrants
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:55.280]   or can you because here there is an exception
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.840]   that specifically says if what you're going after
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:02.400]   with your warrant is the materials used by a journalist
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.040]   in connection with their story, then forget about it.
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.440]   You can't get that warrant.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.720]   - The reason is it's an umbrella protection
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:13.000]   because if you do as the police did,
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.880]   confiscate everything, other sources can be revealed, right?
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:19.240]   So this is a very overreaching,
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:21.040]   these shield laws are very broad,
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:24.080]   but it's to protect, in other words,
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.640]   it doesn't mean he can't be prosecuted,
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.320]   it doesn't mean there's not a way to do this,
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.600]   but it has to be done in a specific way
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:29.920]   because he's a working journalist,
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:31.240]   is that correct, Denise?
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:32.760]   - Yeah, that pretty much captures it.
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.200]   There are different criminal charges
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.680]   that they are investigating.
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:41.000]   In California, we have criminal consequences
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.640]   for misappropriating trade secrets,
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:45.840]   which I haven't seen a whole lot of people
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.680]   discuss yet in connection with this case
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.320]   and what liability might attach to gizmodo/gocker
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.480]   under that provision.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:59.480]   I have seen a lot of discussion about receiving stolen goods
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.240]   and how that might be something
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.160]   that they're being investigated for.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.840]   - But does that change the fact
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.720]   that their ability to do a broad search and seizure?
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:13.480]   - Does it change the fact that there are--
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.400]   - They could do this, execute this kind of search warrant.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.000]   It seems to me that that's prohibited by the shield law
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   except for the two,
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.120]   does the federal law allows it in child pornography
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.480]   and terrorism?
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.560]   (laughs)
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:28.160]   - I don't think even gizmodo went that far here.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.480]   - That's my question.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.080]   And a couple of things that I worry about,
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:34.720]   one is that the judge decided,
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.320]   oh, they're online, they're not a journalist.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:40.080]   And there's California case law that says that's not the case.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:41.480]   In fact, it was an Apple case,
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:44.960]   which you wrote about in your bag and baggage blog.
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:45.800]   - Right.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.880]   - Or that there's the other thing
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.560]   that maybe they're somehow let off the hook
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.920]   because it's a criminal investigation.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:51.760]   - Right.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.160]   - The EFF is not believed that's the case.
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:58.120]   The EFF wrote and Wired republished this opinion
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.360]   that Jennifer Granik said, "It doesn't matter."
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.720]   - Yeah, I put out on Twitter last night,
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.880]   if anybody, any criminal lawyers out there
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.240]   who are looking at this, no of any exception
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.000]   to this provision that says you can't get a warrant,
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.080]   let us know, let's start talking about that.
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.560]   And I haven't gotten any answers back about that.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:21.240]   The most I've seen on this is some arguments
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:23.360]   that were asserted by Apple in the case
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:27.880]   you just mentioned Leo, which was against Jason O'Grady
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.880]   and some other online journalists
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:33.280]   concerning the asteroid device.
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:34.120]   - Right.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:35.960]   - And there was a leak about that.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.720]   Apple contended that there was criminal conduct there
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.760]   for violation of trade secrets
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:44.840]   and got the trial court to buy into that.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.280]   So the trial court refused to grant a protective order
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:51.360]   under the shield law there on this theory that,
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.600]   okay, well, the shield law wouldn't apply
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.040]   if there are criminal acts going on.
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:00.520]   But I haven't delved into Apple's briefing there.
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.300]   It's all there on the EFF site,
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.840]   if anyone is inclined to do that
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.160]   and see what arguments they made
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.480]   if they actually have authority to back that up.
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:10.000]   I haven't seen that authority yet in this discussion
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.160]   and I would like to.
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:15.120]   Until I do, as I read the statutes,
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.280]   I don't see any exception.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:19.880]   I see that if you're gonna get a warrant,
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:21.960]   you need to comply with the warrant provision
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.960]   and these things are carved out of it.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:26.280]   - So I mean, I think that's, okay.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.280]   So that's the legal.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:30.520]   And apparently, according to TechCrunch,
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:35.520]   the San Mateo DA or detectives are pausing,
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.600]   that's the word that was used in their investigation
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:42.480]   to see if they in fact have the right to this evidence.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:46.160]   Would it jeopardize the case if in fact
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.560]   that was an illegal warrant?
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.600]   I mean, would that--
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.640]   - Would jeopardize the criminal investigation?
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.360]   - Yeah, if they decided to do a criminal investigation,
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:54.200]   wouldn't that throw everything out?
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:58.480]   - Yeah, so if you obtain evidence using an illegal warrant,
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:00.280]   that evidence can't be used.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.720]   - So they're saying we're not gonna look at anything.
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.000]   We're gonna pause the investigation.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.080]   We're gonna put this aside.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:08.440]   This is what TechCrunch says.
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:09.640]   We're gonna put it aside.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.640]   We're gonna put it aside, but we're gonna take our time.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.760]   It may take a few days.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:15.680]   If I were Jason, I'd be a little upset.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:19.840]   Okay, so-- - Go ahead.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.160]   - So I just wanted to get that kind of legal groundwork
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.040]   out of it because there's been a lot of discussion
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.480]   on the web about whether it's different
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.480]   'cause it committed a crime or whether he committed a crime
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:31.320]   and all that stuff.
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.120]   And that seems to be really be moot.
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.880]   - Right, it haven't even been charged with anything.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:35.720]   - Nobody's charged with anything.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:36.560]   It's just an investigation.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:37.720]   So John, go ahead.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:42.160]   - Well, I think there's two possibilities.
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:44.160]   There's the possibility to start off with.
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.800]   What are they investigating?
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.280]   I mean, clearly they are investigating
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:49.360]   what they think may be a felony.
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.200]   - Right, right.
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.040]   - I mean, that's-- - It says felony
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:51.880]   on the search warrant.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:52.720]   - Right.
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.280]   I mean, they don't break into people's houses,
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.080]   you know, scoofting around.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:56.920]   - Just 'cause they want to not be able to--
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:57.760]   - So they want to not be able to--
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.520]   - A wouldn't be any reason to break into somebody's house.
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.880]   - Right, so possibility A is that the felony
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:04.040]   that they're investigating is specifically
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:09.040]   and only about the guy or guys who found the phone
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.880]   and gave it over to Gizmodo.
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:15.880]   That that's who they're investigating for a felony.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:19.480]   And if that's the case, then I think clearly,
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:22.840]   what they did to Jason Chen was absolutely,
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:26.720]   it was both wrong and almost certainly illegal.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.760]   You can't, that's exactly what shield laws are about.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:32.600]   You can't issue a warrant against a journalist
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:34.440]   while investigating a crime like that.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.680]   But I think the other possibility is that the felony
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:41.680]   they're talking about is the purchase of stolen property.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:46.320]   That is that Jason Chen is the target or suspect
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.280]   or whatever you want to say of the investigation
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:52.160]   and Gawker media, you know, his employer.
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:59.280]   And in that case, I don't think that the shield laws
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:00.360]   are going to be much help.
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.880]   Now it is interesting, exactly as Denise pointed out.
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.200]   I do think that the letter of the California law,
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:10.080]   that the actual plain reading of it does seem to suggest
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.640]   that they, you know, you could read it and say
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.520]   they can't issue a warrant against a journalist period.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:19.320]   Even if the journalist, you know, matter what they think,
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.160]   even if the journalist himself is the target
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.200]   of the investigation, that as far as I can tell
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:27.400]   and I've done a little bit of research
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:31.320]   and I've seen some posts from actual lawyers
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:34.280]   and a law professor somewhere, you know, who looked at it,
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.760]   that doesn't seem to have been tested in case law,
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:37.840]   that provision.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:42.320]   It doesn't seem like that's actually, you know,
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.200]   that there's any case law deciding what that means.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.240]   - It looked like the law said you need to,
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:48.720]   instead of a search warrant issue, a subpoena
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:50.680]   so that there can be an argument about
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:53.160]   what is appropriate in this investigation
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.560]   and what is protected so that other sources
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:58.800]   aren't revealed in kind of a phishing expedition.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.960]   - But I think I would be very, very surprised
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.920]   if a judge were to rule that this shield law
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.600]   means that a working journalist cannot have a warrant
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.160]   issued against them no matter what,
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:14.560]   they themselves are accused of doing.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.920]   - I don't know, it seems reasonable to me.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.720]   It provides a way to investigate
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:21.760]   that is protecting the journalist's sources.
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.120]   - Well, the thing is that we're saying
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.760]   that we're protecting their sources
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.360]   but we have to remember they already devolved the source.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.200]   (laughing)
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.520]   - But the law, you can't apply the law.
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.040]   I mean, I guess you can apply the law selectively
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.400]   but a judge can but it seems to me
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.360]   if you're gonna have a shield law,
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.520]   it's gonna protect them whether or not you believe
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.760]   they've revealed everything or, you know,
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:43.920]   there's nothing to hide here.
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.680]   We don't know what other sources are there.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.480]   We don't know whether the stories Jason was covering.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.800]   All of those things are protected.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:51.960]   The point of this is you have to bend over backwards
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.120]   to have a free press.
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:59.480]   And what happens, the chilling effect is if a law enforcement
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.400]   could say, "Oh no, oh no, Leo, we think you stole a car."
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.640]   So we're gonna come in and take all your stuff
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.120]   because they don't like something else I said.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:12.960]   That's where you kind of, that's why these laws exist.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:14.600]   I mean, isn't that the point to these?
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:17.560]   - Yeah, but what if they have really good, probable cause
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:19.240]   that you actually stole a car?
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.040]   - I don't know, does that change it?
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.200]   And you're reading things--
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.040]   - I don't think it does.
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:24.880]   - But we're not talking about it.
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.640]   - I don't think it's ever been tested.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.480]   - We're not talking about that.
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:29.360]   How does stealing a car have anything to do
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.440]   with doing journalism?
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.520]   - Well, you know.
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.160]   - Right, so why would they steal my computer?
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.600]   So maybe stealing a car is a bad thing.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:38.100]   Let's say I'm engaged in a blackmail.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:41.000]   And I'm a working journalist.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.960]   And they're investigating the blackmail,
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:44.920]   but they steal, they take all my stuff.
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:46.360]   And in the process of taking this stuff,
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.600]   they happen to find material about sources
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.640]   that they were curious about in, you know,
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.980]   in a Valerie Plainlank case.
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:55.980]   - Isn't, I think that that's my sense
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:57.060]   of what these laws are about.
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:57.940]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:00.100]   - Oh, I'm sorry, I'll always gonna say is to the,
[01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:01.700]   to the issue of stealing a car,
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:03.140]   if I'm an auto journalist,
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:06.340]   I can find a source who has access to the new Pontiac,
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.660]   whatever, and give me information about it.
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:11.620]   I can't bust into like a test track,
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:14.700]   steal it, take it apart my garage,
[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:16.980]   and then write about it and expect that,
[01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:18.540]   well, I just, I returned the car
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:19.460]   and so everything should be--
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.700]   - No, no, and nobody's saying they shouldn't be prosecuted
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.580]   criminally if a crime was committed.
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:24.940]   That's not what's going on here.
[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:26.420]   - I'll say, I mean, I've been very silent
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:28.260]   'cause I know nothing about the law
[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:29.340]   and I should make sure,
[01:51:29.340 --> 01:51:31.340]   that's the sort of thing where professionally
[01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:33.540]   I consult people who can advise me about the law.
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:35.140]   - That's why we get Denise on that.
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:37.620]   - Exactly, that's really the only thing
[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:39.540]   that I'm still fascinated about,
[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:44.580]   that there seems to be two different areas to this case,
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:48.100]   the area in which they might have had property
[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:49.020]   that did not belong to them,
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:50.940]   and then so that by one reading the law,
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:52.420]   that might be stolen property,
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:53.940]   and then the area in which they took a trade,
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.620]   what might be construed as a trade secret
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.420]   and published it, so that's why,
[01:51:57.420 --> 01:51:59.940]   I mean, you can tell me I'm listening closely
[01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:01.580]   'cause I'm like, when he cuts me accidentally,
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:03.020]   I'm like looking like this 'cause I'm--
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:04.340]   - Well, I agree.
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:06.020]   And this is why people get into the law, by the way,
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:09.300]   this is a fascinating intellectual question.
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:11.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:16.140]   You can upgrade the 11 inch for a little more money
[01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:19.020]   to 1.6 gigahertz, but it's still a fairly slow processor.
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:19.980]   Is that too slow?
[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:22.740]   - I'm sure it's gonna be fast enough.
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:24.780]   The big deal is that it has the same accelerated
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:27.300]   and video graphics chip as the regular MacBook.
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:30.180]   So in terms of the things that people will really notice
[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:32.340]   speed for, playback of video,
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:34.260]   and the video that's embedded into web pages,
[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:36.340]   I don't think they'll notice any sort of a difference,
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:37.980]   and the people who are more interested
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:40.860]   in high performance stuff, like aperture editing,
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:42.660]   eye movie editing, they're probably not,
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:43.580]   they're probably gonna be thrown
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:44.740]   by the amount of storage anyway,
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:46.940]   so I don't think that's gonna be a real factor for them.
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:48.300]   - Looks like Becky's trying to go over
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.300]   and talk to Steve Jobs, let's listen in
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.860]   and see what's going on as Becky
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:54.940]   and approaches Steve Jobs here.
[01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:57.220]   - I like it, Steve.
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:53:01.540]   Steve's making the rounds, talking to the people.
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:04.860]   - This is, by the way, a first for us,
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:08.160]   a FaceTime call to the Apple campus.
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:11.180]   I do have FaceTime working on the desktop, but.
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:14.300]   - You know, I do think that there's a question
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:17.140]   of whether the MacBook makes sense.
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:17.980]   - Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:20.140]   - She's talking to Steve.
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:20.980]   - Say that again.
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:23.780]   - One of the machines, I can use one in the great.
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:25.140]   - You like it a lot?
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:27.740]   It fits in the bag and you take it with you everywhere?
[01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:30.700]   - You don't need to be a bag.
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:32.940]   2.3, 2.9 pounds.
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:35.100]   - Can I ask you one other question?
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.780]   Does the fact that we now have FaceTime just on the Mac,
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:41.740]   mean we won't see APIs for other video conferencing?
[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:43.700]   - We didn't say any steps like that.
[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:44.920]   - Okay, just checking.
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:48.260]   - Yeah, there you go, I think that's our first,
[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:49.900]   that's a first on Twit Live,
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:52.300]   an actual conversation with Steve Jobs.
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:53.900]   Well done, Becky Worley.
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:57.300]   That's pretty exciting, thank you Becky for getting that,
[01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:59.780]   that's amazing, well done.
[01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:03.180]   - Oh, I hope I didn't lose her here.
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:09.820]   And the iPhone has failed me, just in the nick of time.
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:11.860]   Let's see if we can get her back.
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:13.780]   There she is, there she is.
[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:17.060]   - All phone.
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.460]   Somebody else is calling.
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:23.660]   - I hate you whoever you are, you lose.
[01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:27.260]   So there you go, you still heard Steve Jobs deny
[01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:31.100]   that the fact that FaceTime desktop is now available
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:32.460]   on the desktop.
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:35.980]   Here's Becky, sorry about that Becky.
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:40.300]   Let me start the FaceTime up again
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:43.060]   and we can talk to you, nice scoop getting Steve Jobs
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:45.580]   and I'm glad you asked him about FaceTime
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:49.140]   and open FaceTime.
[01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:51.420]   - Yeah, that was the one thing that really struck me
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.620]   was the FaceTime issue, maybe it's just my own personal
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:56.060]   bugaboo 'cause I really wanna FaceTime with my kids
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:54:59.060]   when I'm on the road and they just have a computer at home.
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:01.340]   But I just, I thought that we'd heard
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:03.020]   that those APIs would open up later.
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.660]   I mean, that was what I kind of thought might come down
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.100]   after we heard about it just being for Mac.
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:10.580]   But there was no announcement and as Steve said,
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:13.340]   they said no such thing and I don't know
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:15.740]   if we'll ever see those or if this is just a great branding
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:18.220]   and opportunity for them to keep FaceTime to Mac
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:21.620]   exclusive and proprietary, that certainly is an incentive
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:24.860]   for iPhone users to think about their next computer purchase
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:27.020]   being a Mac.
[01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:29.860]   But he seems really happy with the Mac Book airs
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:32.260]   and I would say we have definitely scooped something
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:34.980]   by doing the first interview via FaceTime.
[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:37.300]   - First FaceTime interview, that's awesome.
[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:40.260]   Well done Becky Warley, we'll see you back here
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:43.580]   in just a little bit.
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:45.900]   People keep calling me.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:48.580]   Thank you Becky Warley, really appreciate, well done.
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:51.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:55.580]   - Isn't that great?
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:58.340]   I think I'm pretty sure not only,
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:00.700]   I know that's the first time we've interviewed Steve Jobs
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:03.060]   on Twitch and probably the last,
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:04.380]   but I'm pretty sure that's the first time
[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:08.460]   I ever saw a FaceTime interview anywhere
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:11.420]   and kudos to Becky Warley for scoring that one.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:13.100]   She really is a great reporter.
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:15.580]   Well I hope, by the way, nothing in this,
[01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:19.220]   I don't smoke kids, but this is full of podcasts,
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:20.820]   so it kind of works.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:24.300]   No, it's not, it's chai tea.
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:27.540]   No, no, no, no, no, Jaeger for me.
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:29.340]   I learned my lesson after that, Holla.
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.620]   Did you see, I should plug the Holla Day special.
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:34.380]   If you did not see the Holla Day special,
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:37.540]   John Hodgman, Jonathan Colton, Paul and Storm,
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:40.540]   three full fifths of Jaeger Meister
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:44.220]   and a couple of four locos.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:47.100]   It was just madness.
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:49.220]   Madness, there was actually, the funny thing is,
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.180]   I don't think there was any actual drinking going on,
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:53.700]   but we might as well have been, it was a lot of fun.
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:55.700]   If you haven't seen our Twitch Holla Day special,
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.860]   is that on a special's feet?
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:56:58.700]   Is it on the special's feet?
