[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. We got a big panel today.
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.280]   Andy, Alex Renee, and Lori Gill are all here.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.200]   Of course, the first thing we're going to talk about is the new Apple credit card,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.640]   and the prospects of an Apple bank.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.920]   Then we've got to talk about the next generation Macintoshs that might be running on arm,
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.000]   and what that means for us and iPad.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.320]   And finally, we'll talk a little bit about folding phones.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.280]   There were quite a few announced this week in Barcelona.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.000]   Will Apple do a folding phone? It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.800]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.720]   I know that's not a word, but that's what they are.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.720]   Funnest Mac journalists, Apple journalists in the biz and sit around and gab.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.200]   And since we're kind of in between Apple events, it's all gonna be gab today, starting with...
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.760]   The guy right here to my left, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.760]   Hello, hello.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.480]   From the Pixelcore in studio with us today.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.440]   The rest of them are far, far away.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.840]   Like Andrew and not Ko.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.480]   He is in the fridge at the east.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   This isn't cold.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.640]   This is just crisp.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   Crisp.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   It's a crisp.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   What is it?
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   A crisp 40 degrees?
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.720]   Oh, with a wind chill, it's only 8 minus 8.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   It's fine.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.120]   I was looking at the weather app this morning, I think, "Oh, wow, that's like 45, 46.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.920]   I didn't think it was gonna be that warm."
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.200]   And that's, "Oh, no, actually, that's like the wind speed this morning."
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   Okay.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   Yikes.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   Andrew from...
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.360]   It was fun last night to listen to my UPS clicking on and off and on and off and on and
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.360]   off.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   Oh, the power kept going.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.120]   I had my plan break.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.640]   I had my plan be all set, but didn't have to use it.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.320]   As I see, I was so concerned about wasting power that I didn't want to run down the batteries
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.320]   on my shaver.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   That bad.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.640]   Oh, that's your choice.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.240]   Also with this Lori Gill, she's in the beautiful balmy Sacramento area.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.240]   Hello, Lori Gill, manager.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.240]   One of them's funny.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.400]   It's actually raining today, but I mean, I can't complain about the weather because
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.760]   I don't have a 46 speed wind speed with negative whatever degree cold.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.200]   I don't even understand that.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.320]   You know who's going to win that battle?
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.240]   Our friend and the great white Norse.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.520]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, if I'm more.com, he's in Montreal.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.920]   Beautiful day in Montreal today.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920]   It's just...
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.080]   I need this to end Leo.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.360]   It was like above zero freezing rain, then below zero, everything froze.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   We get ice.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.800]   It's like an ice and snow coffee crisp now, and you never know where you're going to
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   slip.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.280]   Just enough.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   We are gathered today to talk about rumors, nothing but rumors, but lots of them.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.520]   The one I thought was most interesting and I immediately thought of you, Alex Lindsey,
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.440]   because you've been saying Apple should start a bank for a long time.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.040]   Wall Street Journal says Apple will be teaming up with Goldman Sachs to create a credit
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.200]   card.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   That's a first step though.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   Chocked.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   I'm shocked.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Shocked.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.960]   I think a lot of the stories we're going to see today have to do with Apple trying to make
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.280]   money on subscriptions, to be honest with you.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.000]   Trying to make more money per customer because hardware sales are slowing.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.800]   This is an obvious way to do it.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.960]   Goldman Sachs already has a bank called Marcus, which they created a couple of years ago because
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.080]   their securities trading business wasn't doing quite as well as they'd hoped.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.960]   That banking product name makes me think that they hired some eager young go-getter
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.640]   of the age of 28 to bring some fresh ideas to banking.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.560]   He said, "Let's not call it Fidelity Reserve Plus Checking and Banking.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.520]   Let's just give it a fun modern name like Marcus."
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.080]   It is a strange name, isn't it?
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.360]   Marcus is like a lot of these online only banks offers a very high rate of savings of
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.200]   2.25% APR.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.600]   No fee fixed rate loans.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.120]   I don't know if you get...
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   It's a bank.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.840]   It's FDIC, I think.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.680]   I don't know if you get a checking account or anything like that.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.040]   Apple making a credit card, I guess, kind of makes sense because right now if you use
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.480]   your credit card with Apple Pay, the blind share of the revenue goes to the credit card
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.720]   company, right?
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.720]   Not to Apple.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.280]   They get a fraction of that, but they'd get it all if it was an Apple credit card.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.760]   They also, according to the journal, plan to add some features that will encourage people
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.040]   to use it like planning, financial planning, budgeting, money management.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.080]   Why is that interesting?
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.840]   Because these implementation sounds like it's going to take a page from the Apple Watch
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.120]   and Apple Health Book where you're encouraged to close your rings by paying off debt or by
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.840]   filling up savings accounts.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.080]   It'll be almost like that coaching and reward system where...
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.840]   Because right now it's so easy the days go by.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.160]   I say that as somebody whose tax window is rapidly closing here in Canada.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.440]   You forget to put money aside.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.240]   You have bills that come in.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.400]   You're traveling.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   This will just say you pay down this much credit.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.800]   It wouldn't be great if you pay down this much today.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.480]   You put away this much savings this week.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.680]   If you just put away an extra few dollars and it'll sort of walk people through the process
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.360]   of getting better financial health.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.160]   Well, and also, of course, if you want to use those tools, it will incent you to run as
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.720]   many transactions as possible through it, right?
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.120]   Because that way it has perfect knowledge of what you're spending, what you're borrowing,
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.120]   what you...
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.800]   As long as like right now American Express is really good on iPhone.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   The minute I pay for anything, I get a push notification.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   I can go there.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   I can see a list of that.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.200]   That's all integrated into the Wallet app.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.680]   But this would have first party status.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.240]   You imagine they would bundle in things like when you use it, you get points that you can
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.400]   redeem at the Apple Store.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.480]   It would be really interesting if they started full.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.080]   The only thing I don't like about this is that things like Goldman Sachs, things like
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   that are very regionalized.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.320]   They're almost like little fiefdoms.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.080]   They don't really apply globally.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.760]   That's been the issue with the Apple iPhone upgrade program as well.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.480]   That's why I liked it that Apple partnered with American Express because it instantly
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.200]   made Apple Pay available in a much wider series of regions because American Express
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.600]   is effectively their own bank.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.560]   I think, yes, this is like the Motorola rocker of this idea to me.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   It's like we're going to find an integration partner and make a really bad version of it.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.240]   In two or three years, Apple realizes like Alex has been saying, "Hey, we're sitting on
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.120]   a quarter trillion dollars.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.840]   What if we were our own bank?"
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.840]   Then they wouldn't have to do the luxurious fees that have a lot of people upset about
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.800]   this deal because they don't want Apple associated with it.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.280]   Are there regular choices they don't just step out and do it?
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.080]   They could put it under File Maker.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.080]   What File Maker?
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.800]   Well, the thing is that there are definitely huge regulatory issues that Apple has to deal
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.400]   with, but they're not any deeper than FDA.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.680]   There are a lot of startups that are online banks now, right?
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.000]   And the big advantage of doing things that are hard is that it's hard for other people
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   to do them.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.560]   So if Apple goes through the trouble and uses their scale and uses their ability to do that,
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.080]   it means that they're able to do things that other people will have a hard time following
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.640]   and it gives them a...
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.880]   One of the things the journal says is Apple has contracts with banks that prevent it from
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.520]   making their new card the default in the wallet.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.440]   Apple risks angering banks whose cards account for the bulk of the transactions running over
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.080]   Apple Pay.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.640]   And of course, all the regulations are national.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.560]   So before that gets to Canada, they have to have a partner in Canada.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.800]   It does get very complicated.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.040]   And I think that this was a glimmer in Apple's eye when they started Apple Pay.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.800]   I don't think this is something that they just decided to do because the iPhone sales
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   were going down.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.840]   Yeah, like Apple Pay was a glimmer when they did the first Passbook app and they got to
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   Apple Pay.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.560]   Yeah, so I think that this is...
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.920]   You couldn't bring this out first because then none of the banks would partner with you.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.800]   But now that you've partnered, you've all these people using Apple Pay.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.920]   And the thing is if the banks took their cards away, here's the thing right now.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.800]   If the banks take their card away now, we'll all just jump to the Apple one.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.200]   Now they have a place for you to go if your bank...
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.920]   Because most of us don't give a crap about our bank.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.000]   I think banks are realizing that it's so easy to change now.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Yeah, and we don't care about them.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.920]   Why we don't care is because they don't care about us.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.840]   I literally set up a Marcus account with Goldman Sachs in a couple of minutes.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.200]   And it was incredibly easy and they made it very simple.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   I could have transformed.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   I didn't finish it.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.800]   Now I'm getting emails every few minutes saying, "Why didn't you finish?
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   Why didn't you finish?
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.360]   You're so close."
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.440]   One of the things the journal says is that Apple and Goldman considered it a one point
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.680]   creating a more ambitious financial offering that would provide financial management beyond
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.000]   the credit card.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.040]   But Apple executives worried that tapping into people's bank accounts would raise privacy
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   concerns.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.200]   Which they could possibly manage if they were doing it themselves.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.120]   Yeah, I mean, I would rather trust Apple than Mint.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.520]   Yeah, right?
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.760]   But the question is, can they actually make this into a profitable service as opposed
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.800]   to a promotional service for themselves?
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:30.280]   Because unfortunately, the reason why banks keep hitting you with fees and annual membership
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.640]   things is because that's where they make their money from.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.560]   If they weren't able to hit you with overdraft charges, if they weren't able to make you
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.680]   pay for services that are just moving bits from one place to another, they wouldn't
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.040]   have the sort of profit margin.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.760]   This is why Wells Fargo got into so much trouble because they're saying, "Well, all we've
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.680]   got to do is keep getting people to open new accounts, new accounts, new accounts."
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.160]   Even when they don't, they say, "No, don't open a new account.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.920]   Let's open a new account for them and make sure that they don't notice a $40 fee that's
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   being charged to them every single year."
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:06.960]   So as with almost anything that Apple does, the big question will always be, "Is this
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.560]   something they're doing because they want to have that club in their bag or is there
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.480]   something where they feel as though they can actually bring something to the marketplace
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.200]   that isn't being done already?"
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.680]   There's no question that the credit cards are.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.440]   There's to me though that are valuable that make money.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.440]   You can't fly in an airplane anymore without the airplane trying to, all the flight attendants
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.960]   trying to hawk their airline's credit card at you.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   It's because-
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.800]   Well, that's the thing, like the American Express isn't a traditional bank.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.960]   You don't have American Express savings and checking account.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.600]   You don't go to your local American Express.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   They actually do have a bank.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   And you have a deposit, your check.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   They do have a bank.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.200]   You can go- there is an American Express bank you can set up if you're having an account.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.800]   Oh, I'm currently wrong then.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.600]   I think the bank part, I agree with you.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   The bank part is iffy.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.240]   The credit card part is not if.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.320]   Well, and according to the Wall Street Journal, it'll be a master card.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.000]   Card holders will earn 2% cash back.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.600]   That's a lot.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.720]   And potentially more on, as you speculated, Renee, Apple Gadgets and Services.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   We'll get points towards Middleton.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   All right, go ahead.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.040]   What I'm confused about though is this going to be a Goldman Sachs credit card that has
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.520]   Apple benefits or is this going to be an Apple credit card?
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.520]   Who's going to be-
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.600]   I bet there's a big fat Apple on it.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.360]   Who's going to be a part of my money is the key in the situation here?
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.800]   Because I don't want a golden credit card, but I would love to have an Apple on my credit
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   card.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   Right.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.200]   Because to me, the way it's being described, it sounds like it's a Goldman Sachs credit
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   card.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   And then you're going to get all these Apple features with it.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   Right.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   Not that it's an Apple credit card.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   So, you know-
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   I think it's a good step too.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.280]   Google already did this.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.840]   I don't know if you remember this and failed.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.000]   Google had a credit card tied to your Google wallet.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I had one.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.280]   But I think Google's relationship with their users is different than Apple's.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   You know, I think that's the-
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.480]   Was that like the Apple cash or was that an actual credit card?
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.440]   No, they had a- I think it was through Simple.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:58.520]   I can't remember who did it, but Google had a credit card and it would feed from your
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.200]   Google wallet or into your Google wallet.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.080]   And they discontinued that program.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.080]   Some years ago.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.360]   Synchrony, I guess, ran it.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360]   So-
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.960]   But everyone's absolutely right.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.560]   There's so many opportunities to take a brand new approach.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.920]   Just the idea of having burner credit card numbers is such an actually important thing
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   these days.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:27.480]   It's where one of my banks makes it really incredibly difficult for me to even change
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:34.040]   my ATM PIN number because it's basically, I don't know, all run on a deck PDP 11.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   With punch tape or something.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.040]   The exchange was lit in stone.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   Right, exactly.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.440]   Whereas there are other banks have services where, gee, I'm really, really interested in
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.640]   a newspapers.com subscription.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.320]   But if I don't remember to cancel this after a month, I'll get hit with $400 for the entire
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.320]   year prepaid.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.480]   I'm going to give them a burner credit card number so that I will get an email from them
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.520]   saying, "Hey, teensy problem.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.640]   We tried to charge $400 to this credit card and it says this number no longer exists."
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.520]   And then I can actually make the rational decision as opposed to, "Oh, I guess I'm
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.200]   subscribing to premium for an entire year."
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.920]   But these are the sort of things.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.800]   And like Renee said, the ability to simply say, "I'm not terribly, I'm terribly irresponsible
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   with my money.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.480]   But if I had the ability to click a checkbox on my phone and simply say that every time
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:29.400]   I move money into my account in any way, shape, or form, 5% of it goes into a folder
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:36.240]   that is not attached to anything until I realize that my electric bill is due in a week and
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.040]   I already bought my tickets to WWDC and it's nice.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   Oh, great.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   I do have $480.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.120]   If you're sorry, I didn't know that I'd already saved all these sort of stuff that
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:53.440]   will make banking more interactive and more, I don't know, just more beyond an electronic
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.920]   version of writing a check.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   It's more proactive.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.600]   But what you're talking about, which is a great idea, is this something that the finance
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   apps that we have like you mentioned and you need a budget, this will actually, if this
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   were a feature that worked, you could actually set it up so that, for example, if you spent
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.320]   $500 on some computer-related thing, you could even get a notification that says, "Hey,
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.760]   you're about to spend more than your monthly budget on this gadget right here.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.080]   Are you sure you want to do it?"
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.360]   It's notifying you immediately because you just swiped the card and then you can have
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.040]   just a second to stop yourself and go, "Do I really need this $500 computer gadget or
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.680]   maybe I should hold off because I'm trying to save for something?"
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.200]   The proactive banking in that way sounds like such a great idea to be able to do that.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.880]   Interestingly, Apple Pay, at least, Apple doesn't break out Apple Pay as part of its overall
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.040]   services revenue, but analysts have tried to figure it out.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.200]   This is a graph that was in the Wall Street Journal article from Loop Ventures.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.360]   The light blue is other services.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:03.240]   The dark blue is Apple Pay, a fraction, a tiny fraction of the revenue and services that
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.080]   didn't even show up until 2017 and has barely increased since then.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:15.520]   I guess you could say it's doubled every year, but double nothing is nothing.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.520]   That surprises me.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.360]   One of the things that Journal speculates is it might be a way to get more people to use
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   Apple Pay.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.520]   Well, and we always remember the watches were a little part of their revenue as well when
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.520]   they started.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.080]   A lot of this stuff takes some time to build up, but I do think that Apple is in a different
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.200]   position than the banks are because it sells a lot of things.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.160]   Having money coming in one side and then loaning it out the other side down the road could
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.240]   be a very virtuous cycle for Apple.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.440]   I think that Apple's got a lot of reasons to keep it closed up.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.320]   Do you have a ton of cash?
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.160]   Part of the problem with having what is it?
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.920]   $200 billion sit in the bank.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.360]   You got nothing to do with it.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.000]   Yeah, you got nothing to do with it.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Do you invest it?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Do you put it in CDs?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.160]   I remember in the early days of Microsoft, they were making so much money hand over fist
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.360]   that Bill Gates would just keep opening certificates of deposit at bank after bank.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:14.180]   I remember reading about this in their first CFO comes in and says, "Here's all our bank
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.180]   books.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.120]   Figure this out."
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.560]   I think it is a problem in corporate governance as you get really big and you have big cash.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.320]   That cash could be a money maker.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   You manage profit to zero like Amazon and it's all fine.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.240]   No taxes, right?
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.640]   That's definitely something that isn't fully appreciated when you have these large, large
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.200]   tech companies that are famous for their phones or they're famous for their software.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.800]   One of their biggest products that no one ever sees is the division of the company that's
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.360]   just concerned with investing their money and things that have nothing to do with manufacturing
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.360]   or the pipeline.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:57.640]   There's so much going on to make sure that the taps remain open, so to speak.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.320]   This is all speculative, we should point out, but there's another very big story that could
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.800]   conceivably change everything for Apple in the next year or two.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.640]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:14.640]   I guess we have to talk about Apple's folding phone.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.640]   There isn't one outside of Cupertino.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   There isn't one that you can fold and then unfold, I guess.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.720]   They're all for a library.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.920]   I went to my hardware library.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.680]   I got up my iPhone 3G.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.080]   I got up my original iPhone 2G.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.920]   So put them together and put a strip of hands.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.920]   You have a 5G folding iPhone.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.520]   I'll take $2,000 for it from anybody.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.320]   It's too bad you don't have two 3G.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.920]   Then you can have 6G.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.280]   Well, they're exactly like...
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.840]   I'll stop right there.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.720]   You're thinking wrong.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:57.000]   We get $30 million in grant money to research the feasibility.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.600]   Then we show there are folding.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.600]   And they do nothing.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   We'll figure that out.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   And we'll talk about that.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   I don't know how...
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   Hold on.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   I feel about the folding phone.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.600]   What's next?
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.240]   I'll let you lead it off.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.640]   The folding phones in a minute.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.320]   But first a word from our sponsor at Lassie in the IT company.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   They're actually...
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   They're not...
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.680]   There's really a software company that creates collaboration software.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.440]   But software that powers IT teams all over the world.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.320]   Staying competitive in this cloud-based world is tough.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.560]   IT teams have to plan.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.560]   They have to execute.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.720]   They have to do it faster and more accurately than ever.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:41.640]   And because they're working with more and more complex applications, more and more complex,
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.960]   you know, paths, network paths incidents often require open, agile and smart coordination
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.240]   between ops and dev teams.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.400]   Collaboration is really a big deal.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   Expectations are high.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.400]   Stakes are high.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   And the IT team, that's at the center.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.280]   You know at Lassie, I'm sure, because they're the company behind Jira.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.720]   Jira, which brought agile to so many enterprises.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.320]   It's the best way to keep track of.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.040]   And we use Jira here.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.520]   We're absolutely in at Lassie in the house.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.560]   The best way to keep track of who's responsible for what, who's working on what stage the
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.920]   project's in.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:20.000]   And there's nothing more satisfying than moving that column in Jira all the way over to completed.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   But Jira is just the start.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.400]   In fact, one of the things we do, it's so important, is documentation.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.000]   We do that in confluence.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.720]   Another Atlassian tool.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.600]   Having track of where things are, your workflow, how it's going and afterwards, how you work
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.840]   with it is so important.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.880]   Got a big code base.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.120]   Bitbucket is fantastic.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.680]   I see they have other tools too.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.280]   They keep adding new and great features.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.840]   That's what I love about Atlassian.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.320]   It's not just for developers.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.480]   Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable suite of tools for IT teams of all sizes.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:58.200]   From DevOps to Agile, IT apps to ops to ITSM and whatever is next.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.240]   They provide the technology backbone to help modern IT organizations plan, service and
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   support.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.640]   The kind of change that propels the business.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.280]   Jira, Confluence Bitbucket.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.120]   That's the backbone of effective cross-team project planning.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.560]   But then there's Ops Genie too.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.000]   And Status Page to help teams better detect incidents, coordinate response efforts to resolve
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.440]   issues faster, and keep customers or stakeholders up to date.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.360]   All of that integrates seamlessly.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.520]   And like all of Atlassian's tools, they're easy and free to try.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.080]   So there's no reason not to try them all.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.280]   Choose the tools that's right for your framework and trusting that as you grow, they will grow
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.280]   with you.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   Atlassian.com/IT.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:44.120]   Find out which Atlassian offering is right or really combination of authorings is right
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.040]   for your team.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:51.840]   Be free to try it at Atlassian.com/IT.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.760]   And see what IT can be for free.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.560]   That's kind of the Dr. Seuss version of that commercial.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.920]   Laurie Gill.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.320]   Now nobody was in Barcelona this weekend, right?
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   Not me.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   We send people.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   We wish we were in Barcelona.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   I've decided that I'm allergic to jet lag, so I can't fly into a different time zone.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.120]   People World Congress, of course, going on.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.080]   I think it's still going on in Barcelona, maybe it's wrapped up.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:28.680]   And it was an occasion for Samsung a week ago to kind of ahead of time in San Francisco
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:34.600]   announced the new Galaxy 10 as 10 phones, but also to reveal the Galaxy Fold, which won't
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.160]   be available till I think next month you can pre-order it.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   April 26th.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   Oh, April.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.880]   Okay, April 26th.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.840]   That's the phone that folds out like a book.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   So it has an Audi.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840]   It's an Audi.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.440]   There's also Annys.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.600]   That's the Huawei Mate X, which is an trifold.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.880]   The screens are on the outs.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.320]   It's very complicated.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.840]   Now we are starting to get some reports back from people like Vlad Zwav and Dieter Bonet,
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.800]   the Verge, and on text folks who have tried these and generally the reaction is surprisingly
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   positive.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.680]   It's a really great idea.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.040]   It's a great form factor.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.440]   It's exciting to have that extra.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.880]   I'm not making a joke here.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.320]   The extra flexibility of having a pocketable phone that could also expand out into a more
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.280]   of a productivity device.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.440]   And not only that, but just from a design point of view, the idea of all these people
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:35.360]   who have all these really weird designs on their computers at Apple and HTC and inside
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.440]   Google and everywhere say, well, what if we did have the ability to bend the display
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.880]   180 degrees?
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.560]   What problems could we solve?
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.960]   A lot of people are making fun out of it.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.280]   It's certainly going to be a weird...
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.480]   I don't want to become anywhere near the first generation of these devices.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.160]   Also Samsung is not really great at building the first generation of anything.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.320]   And of course, $2,000 for this thing.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.880]   Holy mother of God.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.360]   But it's a truly exciting idea that I hope that there is a lot of follow through on because
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:12.240]   this could be an explosive way of getting us off the seafloor of stagnation in a phone
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   space.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.800]   I couldn't read your eyes, Laurie.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.920]   Did you want one or not?
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:24.480]   So it was very exciting to see this new technology come out.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.520]   So all of the tech world is sort of stagnating right now.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.520]   There's not been really the next new completely different thing.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   And here's this new completely different thing.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.960]   But I don't know.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.520]   There's a couple of things.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.160]   One, it's huge.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.480]   And I don't mean the screen folds out too big.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.480]   I mean, it's thick.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.720]   They're both very thick.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:51.320]   They even the Huawei one, which is significantly thinner, it has this sort of grip on the side
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.000]   that's larger.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.600]   So they're kind of like making their version smaller by cramming everything into this
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.680]   little grip on the side, which still makes it kind of thick.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:06.400]   And I just keep thinking about how the mobile phone, like cellular phones, they used to
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   be really big.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.440]   I mean, think about the car phone and how big the car phone was.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.920]   And then we went super extra small and we started carrying around phones that were three
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   and a half inches.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.880]   They were tiny little phones.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.760]   And now we're moving back to larger and larger and larger.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.280]   And it's getting to the point where mobile devices are not mobile anymore.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.680]   You can't comfortably fit in either of these folds in your back pocket.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   They're way too thick.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.800]   They're way too long.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:40.960]   But it was really cool to see these things in action, to see foldable screens in action.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.840]   So I don't know.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:51.760]   I just think that I just watch it getting bent and thinking, you know, this is I just don't
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.760]   know how it's going to last.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.600]   You know, like I just have this thing like the first people who get this is going to
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.560]   be great for the first three or four months or five months.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.960]   And then after that, also those screens are plastic because you can't bend gorilla glass
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   yet.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.680]   So they have very like pre pre iPhone era pre-corning era plastic screens in the Huawei
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   case.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.640]   It's going to be like, I'm super excited too, that crease I'm never going to not see it
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.440]   until they figure out proper crease management.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.560]   But these are real.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.800]   But I love these early experimental stages.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   I don't like it when we've got an establishment that says this is the way a phone looks.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.160]   I love it when, you know, crazy drunken uncle Sam's like, it's throwing something at the
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.360]   wall and always billions of dollars are just like party time.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.720]   Let's see what we can make it a triangle.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   Who cares?
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.800]   The two triangles that unfolds into a into a trapezoid.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.120]   I love I love this.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.960]   It is so fresh and vibrant and a lot of it is going to be so terrible.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.120]   But I love I love going through that to see what comes out on the other side.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.320]   I want to work in the crease management division.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.000]   I think we don't know.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.320]   But Renee's absolutely right.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.560]   What's Samsung gets a lot I make fun of Samsung for.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.920]   Hey, look, we've got the first 3D space face scanner that somebody at the demo event was
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.000]   able to trick just by taking a selfie on his iPhone and holding up.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.640]   But hey, it's still the first 3D space scanner.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.440]   But the other company that said, wow, creating a huge 5 inch phone.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.720]   That's the stupidest idea ever.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.480]   But hey, we're in the manufacturing business.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.160]   We've got like a dozen different models.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   Let's just do it.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.560]   And then suddenly they've revitalized an entire industry.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.440]   So I'm keen to see how it turns out.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.520]   Everything that's being said here is absolutely true.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:33.560]   I'm mostly about the plastic screen, about the little divot that they're trying to make
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.880]   sure you don't really see.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:41.080]   And I'm also I'll be shocked if after a year of actual use, assuming that people are using
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.680]   it like a phone as opposed to using it as a party trick.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.640]   And I love otherwise keeping it in a drawer.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.800]   I'm also really keen to see if there doesn't become a little like or even a market sort
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.840]   of like line of reduced contrast in the middle of that fold out screen.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.840]   I have to follow this so many times.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.440]   I also thought it was kind of weird that it says I can't wait for the first tear down
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.800]   of this because if I were designing this device and our Samsung, one of my priorities, as
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:17.080]   soon as they showed me the first like the working prototype, I would say, okay, but
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.760]   of course, like when we build the real thing, the closed the the the the the clothes screen
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.240]   is going to be like from the top.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.680]   It's not going to be this like sort of like two inch chin and two inch forehead.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.680]   No, no sir.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.680]   That's exactly what we're going to do.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   Right.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.840]   Like it has no headphone jack and it has a giant notch two things you never thought you
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:40.000]   would see in any Samsung phone, but 5G is so onerous that there's nobody on earth who
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.800]   can fit those modems in nicely.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:48.240]   But you know, Apple's influence is so broad that not only do people see like their hardware
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.120]   designs, but they also said, Hey, you know, that trick where Apple decided to make the
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   default wallpaper for the phone.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.960]   I like a planet on a black background.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.400]   So no one could see the size of our notch.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.400]   Let's do that.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.440]   So no one can see the big the big keyhole on our screen or the big notch on the corner
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.440]   of our folding screen.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.080]   But it's like a pirate patch.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.920]   It's like the entire right hand side of the open display.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   It's pirate patch.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   That's the name.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.960]   Well, and then there's the price and you know, on Friday, starting at 1980.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:26.760]   And then and then and the Huawei Mate X is almost three thousand bucks.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.680]   Yeah, the equivalent if you can smuggle one in.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.280]   Jeff, Jeff Williams, COO of Apple was speaking at Elon University on Friday.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.800]   And one of the students asked him if Apple had any plans to reduce prices.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.120]   He said the stories that come out about the cost of our products have been the bane of
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:50.280]   my existence from the beginning of time, including our early days at Williams said analysts don't
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:55.960]   really understand the cost of what we do and how much care we put into making our products.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   Oh boo.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.760]   He talked about how to make the Apple Watch's activity tracker.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.960]   They built a lab with 40 nurses and 10,000 participants.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.920]   But he did say it's something, you know, the cost is something we're very aware of.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.560]   We do not want to be an elitist company.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.720]   That's not we want to be an egalitarian company.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.360]   We've got a lot of work going on in developing markets.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.320]   He must have breathed the sigh of relief when he saw the price for the one way.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   And it wasn't that right.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.320]   That wasn't them.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   It was probably the big part.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.880]   Oh, I guess $1,100 phone is as expensive as it used to.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.880]   Looking pretty good to you now.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.480]   If you can get two of those in Andy's new case.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:41.200]   And, you know, I don't, I'm not sure if Apple or or if Samsung or Huawei are thinking,
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.120]   oh, this is too expensive, but we're going to do a prototype or if it actually costs
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.120]   that much to me.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.680]   It's super expensive to make small yield.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680]   And so this is the thing.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.240]   It's like that West Wing episode where Donna says, come on, these pills cost 25 cents.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.600]   And Josh says, no, the second one cost 27, 25 cents.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.280]   The first one costs $2 billion.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   Right.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.920]   And they have to admit, they have to amortize that cost over how many they think they're
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.920]   going to sell.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.440]   And they're not going to sell 100 million of these.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.120]   Like they would the Galaxy S10.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.600]   So they have to figure out where manufacturing costs this much.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.960]   We're going to make this many.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.280]   And that's, you know, these are for the early adopter nerd super rich people who don't.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.320]   They want to be part of the process and they're willing to pay a surcharge to be part of the
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.080]   process of discovering what's next.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.760]   And I'm not worried about it because not because I think that's a rational amount of money
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.560]   to spend on a phone, but because there are so it's not as though congratulations.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.640]   We are the only manufacturer of phones and we've suddenly decided that the minimum buy-in
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.440]   is going to be $1,980.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:44.560]   It is a super high end phone that does things that for a good whole six days, you could
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.080]   say no other phone in the world could do, but still.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.680]   And if you've, and at least in that side of the marketplace, if you want to buy an $80
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:57.160]   phone, you can still buy an $80 brand new quite capable phone.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:02.960]   So it's one of those cases where you can say, you're right, that is way too much money.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.120]   That's why you definitely shouldn't buy one of these if that's way too much money for
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.120]   you.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.480]   And in a lot of countries, people are paying 2X for an iPhone.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.720]   So it's one of those things that as a status symbol, it's not there's 10 people out there
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.880]   looking for a status signal.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   There's millions of people out there.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.520]   Well, then I say that a folding phone, there's no question you have the latest greatest phone,
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.520]   right?
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.520]   I mean, it's so different.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.520]   You have to have flex with it though, right?
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.520]   You've got to go, oh, you've opened my phone and tell you.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.520]   Here are the directions you want.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.720]   Let me see my new video.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.200]   But then people do know, I mean, immediately, they made such a big deal over the price that,
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.160]   oh, wow, this guy has $2,000 to spend on a phone.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.440]   Like Laurie said, though, it's so thick.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:45.220]   like TH II that's not sick. That's not THI CCC CCC. This is thick.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:50.720]   This is the energizer. $18,000 in his phone.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.200]   Dave Gersch Gjorn of course says it's not just thick it's
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.500]   unusably thick. He said you can barely hold it in your hand.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.180]   It's, it's unspelable. Yeah. I disagree. I disagree with that.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.660]   If you put that in a sock, that is incredibly useful of a legend of
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.080]   self-defense device. Well, an energizer, which is a battery company,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.520]   let's face it, also says you can use it as a battery charger to
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.120]   charge your other devices. You look at it. You can do that with the
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.360]   new Samsung Galaxy. Well, it's thick. Probably not that much thinner
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.620]   than that. That's probably a little bit thicker. You have other
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:27.320]   stuff in there, Alex. I'm pretty sure it's a lot thicker than
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.400]   that actually. Look at that picture. That thing is really thick.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.920]   Yeah. That whole cell phone ad where the guy said told his
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.040]   friend that had theft protection when he threw it at his head.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.280]   It's just like that. I think there's definitely, I don't think
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.520]   that thinness is everything. I think that if most phones were
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.400]   one third thicker, they could be so much more useful and not just
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.280]   because of battery life. But nonetheless, like as Laurie said
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.320]   about the folding phone, like if you've got, if it's thick enough
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.720]   that you can actually put your logo on the spine of the phone.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.120]   Clearly, this is not what your head, what your, this is not an
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.760]   all-aspirational design choice. But I think that, you know, I
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.280]   think that there are markets and you know, I think that you,
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.120]   in today's market, if you're not in that cool section that Samsung
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.240]   and Huawei and Apple kind of own in a lot of ways and a couple,
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.560]   maybe a couple other manufacturers, you have to find the
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.680]   vertical that's going to make the most sense. So if you're
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.520]   dealing with folks that want to use a phone that's way out into
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.760]   the middle, you know, going into the middle of nowhere for a
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.360]   long period of time, and you don't know how many, how often
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.160]   you'll be able to charge. I think that this thing could make a
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.600]   lot of sense. I think that it makes a lot of sense in, I mean,
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:39.000]   I could see this being a combat ready, you know, phone, you
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.240]   know, where you put it into any cases and that means that you
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.160]   don't know. You have guys that are candles that would make
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.480]   sense for. And so I think there's a lot of,
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:51.160]   more efficient to have like a smaller phone and then a portable
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.400]   battery, and then maybe even like that portable battery has
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.160]   some kind of attachment so that you can actually stick the phone
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.280]   right on the portable battery.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.120]   Yeah, the battery case in a lot of those areas when
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.160]   whether it's combat or whether it's, you know, you camping or
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.520]   whatever, it's a lot of dirt. There's a lot of other things
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.400]   going on and having things break up into little pieces is not
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.840]   necessarily a feature that you that is aspirational. So so
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.120]   having it all contained in one unit. You know, I think you could
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.080]   have people that because even now with this phone, I mean, I'd
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.600]   like as with Andy, I'd love it to be a third, you know, thicker
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.320]   and able to actually last a day because right now I feel like
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.920]   I'm constantly charging my phone.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.960]   Here's another shot from Vlad Svov on on that.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.600]   That's a lot of batteries. That's. Yeah, that's that's
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.160]   aggressive.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.960]   Defending it, I would never mind. You have to you want to
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.480]   balance two things. You have two conflicting demands, almost
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.880]   like security and convenience. You have longevity. You want the
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.200]   phone to have a battery that lasts as long as possible. But
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.960]   batteries are not RF transparent. Batteries are not good for
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.560]   thermals because they get very high. And also they're heavy.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.680]   They're very heavy components. And you also want someone who's
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.880]   going to the doctor's appointment, wants to read their book,
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.440]   play their video game, watch their video, whatever, waiting at
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.440]   the airport for hours. And you and it's everyone says, yeah,
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.240]   yeah, you're not strong enough to hold up a phone. But you're
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.440]   holding it up for hours. It starts to get heavier. And so you
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.720]   want to sort of find the sweet spot where an average person
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.960]   can hold it up for a useful amount of time. Because no matter
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.440]   how much charge you have in it, if you get tired of holding it,
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.760]   and you want to have it last, doesn't matter if you can hold
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.000]   it if it runs out of battery and you can no longer use it. And
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.200]   finding that sweet spot, I think we have gone too far in one
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.760]   direction. But finding that sweet spot is where I think a lot of
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.680]   these phones have to hit.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.760]   This thing is really
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:30.760]   really,
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   let's also let's also not ignore that if you made in addition to
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:38.200]   battery life, if you made a phone thicker. And one of the payoffs
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.520]   was we don't have to glue everything together. We don't have
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.720]   to make all these compromises about repairability. We can we're
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.560]   not going to make it out of Lego bricks. But nonetheless, it
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.760]   will be relatively easy to replace a cracked screen. It'll be
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.600]   trivial to replace a battery. And even if even if we decide that
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.560]   we want to swap out as a motherboard to just the next
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.000]   generation version of this same platform, it might be possible.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.680]   All these things, all these things could be done if you decide
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.600]   that you decide that you don't have to make this thing as
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.320]   thin as possible.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.280]   It does kind of look like a modern bezel-less Android phone
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.680]   glued to a giant.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.480]   On to 18 other modern bezel-less.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.600]   And I think it's like extruded.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.480]   You know, when you think past the things that I that I just said
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.360]   there, but if you're working in events where you're up, you
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.280]   know, you're really pushing things hard all the time or you
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.760]   working in construction, you're working all kinds of areas
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.680]   where you're not going to necessarily have time to set it
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.080]   down and being able to be able to not just have long ready time
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.160]   but haven't me actively pushed as far as it can go all day
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.520]   without having to worry about it. I think I think it makes
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:44.920]   sense for
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.200]   part.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:47.720]   I guess
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.960]   sorry, Annie.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.080]   No, I just just quickly saying as as part of a large
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   ecosystem of phones where again, if this is way to this is
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.480]   ridiculously thick and ridiculously heavy for you, you're
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   right. Wow, you absolutely should not value this. You should
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.840]   buy any of 100 other phones you can buy in this space. This is
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.680]   this is why, like, if sometimes it seems as though I and other
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.000]   people are saying, Oh, Apple, they just don't they're just not
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.680]   into innovating anymore. They're just they're going to copy
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.600]   wait for other people to to innovate and then copy them.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.760]   It's because Apple is not in a position where they can
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.720]   stop making a somewhat conservative advice because that's
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:30.240]   the only $800 phone that runs iOS. And if they do something
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.680]   crazy with it, that is going to alienate 20% of their users.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.920]   They're they've got no place to go but elsewhere.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.080]   Like give it a horrible keyboard. That's why I use the
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.560]   thank you battery case.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.200]   Bless you for making me not say that.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.640]   Annie, I saw your twin. You're on the edge, buddy. You're on
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.280]   the edge.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.680]   The cutting edge man.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.920]   Andy tweets. What did you tweet? If Apple doesn't fix his
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.680]   keyboard, I'm going to buy my next laptop is going to be a
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:04.840]   thinkpad. So when someone asked me on Twitter, someone asked me
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.760]   on Twitter about, well, what's the alternative? And I need to
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.360]   make the point, the alternative to this MacBook is any other
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.280]   laptop by any other manufacturer. And without hopefully
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.240]   wasn't snarky or aggressive, I was saying in my case that I
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.680]   cannot buy a Mac, a MacBook Pro, any 2016 or later model is
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.480]   simply inadequate to my needs. It's not a it's not an ego
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.720]   thing. It's not a statement thing. It's just not going to do
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.800]   the job that I need a laptop to do. And so if my this 2015
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.280]   MacBook Pro of mine that I love is where most definitions of
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.880]   the word love should should die on me. I'm buying a thinkpad
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.360]   or I'm buying a Chromebook. There is just no way I'm buying a
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.720]   MacBook unless Apple decides to not just simply continue to fix
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.640]   this with it with the 26 I'm sorry, I should wind this down. But
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.200]   in the problems I've been seeing with the 2016 model is that
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.560]   they put square wheels on something, and which made it
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.840]   terrible. And then rather than saying, wow, this was a
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.640]   terrible idea, let's go back to round wheels. They said, no,
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.280]   no, if we just beef if we would increase the size of the
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.080]   wheel wells, so it no longer scrapes cake, we could make
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.840]   bigger wheel wells, but it's still like very, very bumpy. Okay,
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.480]   but we'll beef up the suspension. Okay, now you've beef up the
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.040]   suspension, but now it's hard for people to climb into it. Well,
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.520]   if we create this new electronic ladder system, or you could
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.720]   just switch back to something that worked before. So all I was
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.760]   saying last night was that I can't buy a new MacBook because
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.840]   it's just not going to do the job I need a laptop to do show the
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.680]   tweet if you would.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:42.440]   Try signal to car cities not hearing me. Yeah, if Apple sticks
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.720]   to this MacBook design that when my 2015 MacBook Pro dies, I'm
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.760]   placing it with a think better Chromebook. Oh, that's an
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.440]   interesting one. And we're gonna have to create a new role for
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.800]   you the anti editor or something if you do that. Oh, no, no,
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.360]   Oh, God, you already got one to work in. That's such a good
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.200]   job with that that I don't know. That's a little title in Matt
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.640]   was a Mac world or Mac. I think the back Mac is pretty much
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:10.120]   I think they're pretty much in or something. I find that I'm
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.520]   now typing almost I fight on the side of the angel. So I know
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.360]   I'm saying the other key the keyboard on the new Macs don't
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.560]   bother me because I'm almost all my long form is now being
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.840]   typed on my iPad. The only thing I go back to my my laptop for
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:27.120]   now is the high tech, you know, like using cinema 4D or using
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.800]   omni-graffle, which is available in the iPad. But here's the
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.120]   problem with drawing packages. I had to really think through
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.200]   this like why can I not use a drawing package on my iPad?
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.800]   Number one is I can't see my cursor under my finger. And
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.000]   number two is your movement is one to one. So as you move your
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.800]   finger a little bit and with your mouse it's magnified, right?
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.560]   You can be much more precise. And so being able to be precise
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.720]   is something that is still a challenge on an iPad. But I find
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.880]   now that you know like and what I like about the iPad I was
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.760]   thinking about it is while I'm just using an Apple iPad, I
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.320]   can or a case or whatever, you know, you can get other cases
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.400]   with other keyboards. And so it's not, you know, I think that
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.800]   we're kind of I feel like I'm almost post laptop. And you
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.160]   know where I feel like I'm going to you end up using my
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.000]   desktop for most of my heavy work. And and then I use my iPad
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.600]   and my laptop now I open it up and I realize it hasn't
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.280]   checked the mail in like seven days. So why can't we just get
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.280]   one device that's an iPhone that you fold it out once and it's
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.440]   an iPad and then you fold it out again and it's a MacBook or
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.200]   you can flatten it down in front of a cinema display and it's
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.200]   your touch interface for final cut. Call up origami. That is
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.960]   going to be our next topic really, which is the future of Apple
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.560]   before we leave this folding phone topic. Is there any
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.560]   consequence to Apple to just sitting back and watch this
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.640]   unfold like with smartphones for 10 years or how
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.240]   work out with these for 10 years or watches for five years
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.400]   making a foldable phone right now. They're doing it.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.760]   They're doing it. They've had prototype since iPhone 4s
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.560]   period of time and they've been doing it for years. I think
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.640]   they're quite happy to see what works and doesn't work. I
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.600]   mean, that's what Apple does is they just kind of draft on
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.080]   everybody and watch what what is working, not working and then
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.160]   just step in with a solution that they think is a is a better
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:17.720]   one. Yeah, I think you Renee had a good tweet on this topic,
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.920]   which I can't remember, but I'm sure you will. I think it's
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.520]   in the Renee. Here it is. No, it's yeah. Is this it? Apple
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.960]   has historically done the opposite. They culturally would
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.520]   rather eat themselves and have someone else do it. I know
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.080]   that's because something more saying Apple would never do a
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.880]   foldable phone because it would cannibalize iPad. No, that's
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.080]   not Apple Apple. Apple destroyed the iPhone. That's right.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.000]   That's a that's a that's a that's as part of a longer thread
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   about about this topic. Yeah.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.320]   Renee's earlier tweet was very much on point saying for people
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.120]   who are again rolling their eyes and saying, Oh, Apple, they
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.320]   never innovate anymore. And Apple saying, yeah, just like,
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.760]   you know, they just like there's 10 years of smart watches
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.720]   before Apple did the Apple Watch. There were 10 years of
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.240]   tablets before Apple did the iPhone. They're 10 years of
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.560]   phones. And if I were if I were argumentative, I could nit
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.600]   pick about a couple of details. But that's really a very overall
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.240]   a very, very good point. They're really not in the business
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.120]   of proving how hot they are bringing a brand new thing to
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.360]   market. There is I think I think but I think I replied to
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.480]   someone else's reply about this by saying that with Apple,
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.640]   there's so much about a is this new thing a fad or is it really
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.800]   important? The second thing is, is there something that Apple
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.960]   feels as though they can really bring to this as opposed to
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.320]   just participating in this new wave of thing? And then
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.920]   thirdly, is this for from consumer point of view, is it
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.880]   something they're legitimately interested in like a wearable
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.880]   watch? Or is it something like a smart speaker where they're
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.760]   just sort of content to let their design and let the logo sort
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.640]   of carry the day as opposed to really, really being completely
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.360]   obsessed with doing a great job about this? So I'm not
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.080]   I'm not worried. Yeah. Okay. I think that one of the things
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.320]   that Apple does better than most companies, and this is why
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.120]   they can kind of draft is they're they're much better at
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.800]   solution based engineering. So a lot of engineering gets into
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.760]   this idea of they get caught up in the technology, like we do it
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.640]   because we can do it. And I think Apple does a better job at
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:18.000]   doing what we must because we can. Sorry. Sorry. I
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.360]   automatically did a portal show. We do what we must be
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.920]   apertures science. We do what we must because we can. Yeah,
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.960]   it's so I think that I think that a lot of times we we work
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.600]   with teams and a lot of times you see people just go into this
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.840]   they're into the technology because of the technology and they
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.240]   they keep on putting up little new little things that are
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.840]   really cool, but they're not thinking of the big picture of
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.800]   how does this actually make sense? How does it, you know, how
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.880]   does it actually serve the the real solution and make it
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.720]   actually easier for a human being to do something? And I think
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.720]   that that's one of the things that Apple tends to do better
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.920]   doesn't they don't get they don't hit it all right all the
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.200]   time, but they tend to do it better than than most.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.120]   Yeah, that said, it would be nice to see them do like something
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.280]   like like when I think about all the things that consider to be
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.920]   great, great, great computers and computing platforms, the list
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.560]   always includes the Raspberry Pi and it actually always includes
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:18.480]   the the Amazon Kindle things that were we had no idea how much
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.920]   we needed this thing until this thing exists, existed, because
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.760]   sometimes you really just have to say we're not we think that
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.480]   there's a market for this we won't know until we put it on the
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.520]   market, but this is such an interesting idea that we're
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.600]   going to go ahead with it. That's not something that again,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.120]   it's something that Apple isn't necessarily free to do because
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.040]   of how their business is run. But you have to also acknowledge
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.920]   when someone has said, wow, I would have never said that a
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.840]   notebook computer that is essentially just a web browser
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.800]   or a computer that were all they were the number one design
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.960]   imperative was there's no way we can sell this not make this
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.120]   but sell this for more than $34 and think that this is the one
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.360]   the most important and transformative and wonderful
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.040]   computers ever ever made. This is why it's exciting to be
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.360]   writing about technology when these when some people do decide
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.440]   that no, we're not going to evolve. We're not going to create
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.200]   a new a better version of the netbook. We're going to create
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.760]   something that takes the good ideas from this and leaves the
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.960]   other ideas behind or when we realize that, wow, there has
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.160]   been this Raspberry Pi shape hole in computing for at least
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.120]   the last six years. And it's time that somebody like us comes
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.280]   along and spackles it with something like a Raspberry
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:30.680]   Pi.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:34.240]   Right. When I look at how many things we use Arduino and
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.640]   Raspberry Pi is for to glue to glue our world together. You
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.400]   know, it's the one reason that I probably would not, you know,
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.280]   right now I'm getting ready to really push my kids through the
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.520]   kind of swift training. And but the one reason they won't learn
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.840]   only swift is because they need to be able to program on our
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.280]   world. We know because you know, because you can't do maker. You
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   can't make things without without at least an Arduino. There's
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.920]   the language. Of course. Yep. Fourth. They need to all learn
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:05.680]   force. In my day it was logo. So another another boat Apple might
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.960]   have missed the HoloLens this week. Microsoft also on Sunday
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.840]   showed off its second generation HoloLens. Remember Apple is
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:17.280]   all in on augmented reality. But as yet has no product,
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.520]   Microsoft's already iterating on a product they introduced four
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.480]   years ago. Consumer product that they're selling hundreds of
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.760]   millions of a year and I can't believe Apple missed that
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.760]   market. Yeah, no, it's not. You're being facetious. Of course,
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.200]   in fact, they completely dropped for the most part any
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.440]   attention to the consumer market at the very end, the creator
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.280]   of Fortnite, Tim Sweeney stepped on stage for what's that
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.720]   seemed like 30 seconds to say, yeah, this will be great for
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.560]   games too. Bye.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:45.880]   I have a Fortnite bus. Yeah, but it really was it was all about
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.880]   enterprise. It was all about Azure, the cloud at Microsoft's
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.640]   cloud. It was all about how people could use it to
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.760]   teleconference, to design buildings. I'm super happy that
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.880]   there's companies who are willing to do all this in public.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.480]   They beta in public. They test in public. They're not the
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.240]   unabashedly do what they let you have early access to
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.440]   hardware because they want to see you figuring it out. And
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.520]   Apple is just not that company. They keep their shame
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.440]   internal. They beta internal. They've got all sorts of glasses
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.440]   flying around sunny, but none of us have ever seen them. And
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.560]   once they watch how everyone reacts to all the Google
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.000]   glasses and the Microsoft stuff, and they think they have a
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.760]   product that they can actually sell that our parents, you
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.400]   know, our kids will be able to pick up and use, then they'll
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.600]   they'll bring it to market. But you know, they're not again,
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.120]   they're not late. There's no market yet. And the and the AR,
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.160]   the AR stuff that they are doing is prepping for all of this.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.120]   There's so many problems where they are right now being able to
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.040]   track objects. We haven't even gotten to what I would true
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:41.960]   location based process. I would disagree. I think that there
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.000]   is an advantage. And it's kind of long standing tradition in the
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.520]   startup community that you get a product out a minimum viable
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:55.080]   product out to real users as early as possible. Because until
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.360]   you get it to users, you don't really know what the real
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.360]   issues are internal testing is not enough. But but Microsoft's
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.880]   doing a lot of the work for them. You know, so Microsoft's
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.120]   getting all the data. They're not getting a lot of data. But if
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.200]   you get one of them and you start, well, here's what happened.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.240]   Look at it. You can play with it. But I don't know if you look
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.960]   at Animoji Leo, Animoji are really dumb. They're really
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.600]   dumb, but they're getting entire generations of people to sit
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.080]   there and scan their face and see it in an augmented reality
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.960]   world without being thrown into it terrified, confused. It's
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:26.280]   like, Oh, look, I can be a pig. Oh, look, I can create my avatar.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   And then they're they've got an Animoji avatar there in an AR
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.200]   world. And you see all the games that are on the Apple's just
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.920]   beta testing it through existing hardware. And yeah, there is a
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.400]   lot of loss to that. But there's also a lot of user education
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.560]   going on there. And it's just it's a different methodology, both
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.240]   have their pros and cons. But Apple just they won't sell like
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.960]   30,000 units to an enterprise. It's just not how they're
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.320]   ranked.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:55.440]   Recently, Frank Casanova was appointed a senior director of
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:00.160]   worldwide product marketing for augmented reality. Casanova
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.760]   has been at Apple since longer than Steve Jobs, I feel like
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:09.440]   is really a very low digit employee number. Yeah, that's a
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.480]   really interesting play there. But I honestly think that there is
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.920]   some value to getting out there. You know, and here's where I
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:21.040]   would say there's proof is in the pudding, magic leap, which for
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.160]   so long, maybe three or four, maybe five years was developing
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.120]   in secrecy in private. They finally released a developer
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:35.200]   version last year. And it was a big dud compared to what Apple
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.280]   watch was like a year too early. Like maybe they could have
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.920]   spent a next year on it to figure it out. There's value in
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.920]   getting it out there. I really do. Yeah. No, you're
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.680]   absolutely right. And Apple Watch is actually a great example
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:52.040]   where it's it's for years. Well, yeah, but not but the thing
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.760]   is the thing is people in our industry are very quick to say,
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.440]   Oh, look, Google glasses look how horrible they were. Oh, God,
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.800]   I would don't want to be a bleep bleep hole using Google
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.200]   Glass. But the thing is you have to you're absolutely right. You
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.160]   do have to put it out there to figure out how people you can't
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.880]   you can't just rehearse and rehearse and rehearse a play
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.440]   endlessly and say that you're actually developing it at some
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.960]   point, you have to bring in a live audience and see how they
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.480]   react to this without telling hearing the whole story behind
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.200]   what your concept was. The Apple Watch is a great example
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.760]   where they it's such a classic Apple product where they got
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.120]   they got the hardware 100% correct, because that's the one
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.360]   thing that you can't change in three weeks time with this with
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.200]   the system update, you can't send molecules over Wi-Fi, but you
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.160]   can send a new interface, you can send new software. And they
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:45.560]   really did take a couple of years of watching people use these
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:51.040]   things to realize that, wow, that idea of us of an Apple Watch
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:54.920]   user opening a garage door with their watch and watching live
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.520]   video of the garage door opening and their kids coming in.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:02.440]   Nobody that was such a dumb idea. But this idea of being the
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:06.680]   hub of a fitness related sort of set of features and apps, that's
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.560]   absolutely where everybody wants this to be. And they would
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:13.200]   never have learned that if they had simply decided, here it is,
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.640]   and we're not changing it, they need to get it up there and
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.160]   figure it out.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.200]   There's some key technologies that we'll probably see this year
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.760]   next year that are still required for the glasses to work.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.040]   You know, as someone who owned Google Glass and has used
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.160]   HoloLens and, you know,
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.200]   develop, you know, all that stuff is that one of the big
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.960]   things is actually understanding where you are. And I mean,
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.800]   down to the millimeter of exactly where you are opens up this
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:40.120]   whole world that right now we're slowly creeping towards the
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:44.200]   persistence and those types of things are are hints towards a
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:48.280]   path that is we're not quite along. And so it's not worth
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.120]   releasing any hardware until it's degree. I mean, what if Apple
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.440]   had said we're not going to release a personal computer until
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.240]   we can make an iPad. They would never have gotten to the iPad.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.680]   They would also be doing over the entire centrist line. So
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.480]   that would have been OK. I think I'm going to skip that one. I
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:09.720]   agree. But but but I would say that Apple, Alex is right and
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.400]   that the hardware for AR just isn't there yet. It's there in
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.920]   a form. It's only there if you can afford to have a specific
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.640]   use case for it and spend thousands of dollars per unit,
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:23.160]   which is why Microsoft and Google are going towards enterprise
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.960]   as opposed to a consumer angle right now. However, I would say
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:29.160]   that Google and Apple there, but we're there, they're shipping
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.640]   more and more of the software of their wearable device that we're
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.600]   not going to AR device that we're not going to see for another
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:41.080]   two or three years. But as we get the as the voice systems
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.680]   become more and more sophisticated, that's how we're
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.480]   going to be talking to our to our glasses. We're going to be
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.840]   safe. Hey, glasses. Remember this. Remember this phone number
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.960]   that I'm looking at right now. And guess what? We already have
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:58.120]   on other on certain phones, the ability to hold up a camera and
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:01.560]   say copy anything that's interesting from this photo and
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.600]   put it into my address book. And we're getting augmented reality
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.480]   maps and we're getting all these other smart features and the
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:13.240]   ability to simply say on iOS ability to save a whole bunch of
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.000]   complicated workflows as a simple spoken command. So we are
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.120]   really, really absolutely seeing all the software. We just don't
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:25.000]   have the hardware to do it yet. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe, maybe the
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.640]   issue is that it's farther off than we think. One of the things
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.720]   Apple, I mean, Microsoft did do is bring an iPad on stage with the
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.120]   HoloLens and showed that, well, one of the workers, one of the
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:40.520]   employees say designing an engine or repairing an engine can be
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.640]   wearing HoloLens that $3,500 product. Of course, you can rent it
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:47.720]   for $125 per user per month. So it is relatively affordable. But
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.160]   the other ones who don't have a HoloLens can use because it
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.320]   works with a ARKit and a ARCore, Google's solution can use an iPad
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.560]   and just have to hold their iPad up, you know, a dangle of
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:03.080]   camera, the phone off and the hat. It moves a little bit, but
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.560]   really gives you hand cream. Yeah. And really, maybe the reason
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.280]   Apple hasn't put one out is because we're, as you, I guess
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.240]   are really saying, Alex, we're too far away from them and they're
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.640]   minimum viable product. They're not putting that yet. They're
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.880]   not putting the hardware out, but they are putting the software
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.760]   right now. But I don't think you learn as much from how people
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:23.240]   use Memojis. No, not Memojis, the AR, the AR games, the AR stuff.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.240]   Now, what I do think they need to do is send more. Everybody using
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.960]   those to your kids use them. No, I don't even know. No, because
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.840]   it's not there yet. And so there's a bunch of the technologies
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.040]   that are not learning much. Well, those technologies, you're
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.280]   not going to, the problem is you're going to give away your
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.600]   industrial design. You're going to give away, you know, how
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.840]   you're approaching that and you're not going to get any return
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.840]   for it until those other technologies are developed. That's
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.400]   Apple's thinking. They're very secretive. Right. Well, because
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.360]   what you get for is real world experience. You do get
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.280]   something for it. I just think, I think what we're going to find
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.840]   is that when, you know, when they actually put it out, once
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.160]   all those technologies are working, then it's, you know, it's a
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.880]   magical experience, you know, where it's not going to be right
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.840]   now it would be not. The first iPad had a spinning hard drive in
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:04.440]   it. The first iPod didn't have solid state memory, but it's
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.600]   still they had they had the and you could have made the case you
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.560]   can't make a good iPad mp3 player unless you have solid state
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.520]   memory, but they've made it. Well, I can't get another case.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:16.040]   There is a lot of registration issues and all kinds of issues
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.560]   with AR right now that are with all the best. Even the best AR,
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.120]   even even the HoloLens. I mean, there are just a lot of
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.920]   problems with it at the moment that it is not a magical experience.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.640]   There are there are moments of greatness where you if you have
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.280]   vision, you can see it like I because I work on this a lot.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.480]   So there's moments where you're working on AR and VR and you go,
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.880]   oh my goodness, this will change the world. And then it breaks,
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:39.080]   you know, and and and all of them break right now. And so what
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   you're going to end up with is just a bunch of people frustrated,
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.840]   you know, that it isn't working and you're going to get a bunch of
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.400]   complaints and that's where and that's and that's the reason
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.200]   you go the reason that Microsoft and Google pay attention to
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.280]   industrials because those guys are willing to deal with it.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.720]   They're like, that doesn't work all the time. That doesn't work all the time.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.640]   Apple doesn't want anybody saying, oh, that's that that Apple product is not
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.440]   up. They don't do industrial only, you know, like they do consumer products.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.160]   And and you can put up with things that you can put up with the whole
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.520]   scene sliding a little bit or something not registering or, you know,
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.560]   all these other bits and pieces. You're willing to put up with that as an
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.040]   industrial user and not necessarily as a consumer.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:13.720]   Also, it's it's a you're in a very, very good marketing position when
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.080]   you're when the people are selling it to can tell the end user,
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:21.800]   use this or you're fired. Right. Yeah, you have to use it. No matter.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:24.120]   There's going to be I mean, when we when we think about the AR,
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.560]   it's going to be very exciting. When you think about training people,
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:31.800]   like some of the stuff we that we have played with a little bit is imagine
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.560]   being able to we think about that engine being able to your disassemble an engine
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.240]   this little arrow. Take this out next. Yeah,
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:43.080]   like a demonstrate. You want to take this out next to do this.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.080]   That's what they demonstrate. How pretty amazing.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:48.200]   How to use an object and your whatever it is, whatever the tool is,
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   you turn this little dial and then you do this thing and the ability to learn that is,
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.320]   you know, that it's going to be transformational. It's just not there yet.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:59:00.120]   Is it ever going to be consumer facing though? And like, even what you're talking about sounds
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:05.800]   more like educational training, industrial? How does how is this applicable to like the
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:10.680]   me sitting around in my house? And I think maybe that's where we're we're not seeing Apple
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.200]   kind of like digging into the hardware part of that market is that like,
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:18.520]   maybe this is never going to be a consumer facing industry.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:23.800]   Well, if you imagine cooking, you know, like teaching you how to, you know, like you could be
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:27.240]   sitting there cooking with things that are popping up. You could, you know, whether you're
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:31.080]   fixing when you're fixing something in your house, but we should also remember that the K through
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:36.440]   12 market is a $600 billion market. I mean, that's the total money invested in education.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.000]   So yeah, definitely. So $600 billion is and that's just K through 12. It's a trillion dollar
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.840]   market if you get into the wider market. So it's it's not a it's nothing to, you know,
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.720]   education is not nothing to ignore.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:53.720]   All right, let's take a break and then we're going to come back and talk about
[00:59:53.720 --> 01:00:02.760]   the 2021 Max and how they're going to be very different, very different. Our show today brought
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:10.360]   to you by Sophos. We are protected by an invisible shield all around the Twitch studios.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:16.760]   Powered by Sophos cyber security. Sophos is really awesome. Anybody in enterprises,
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:21.560]   well aware of Sophos. And many of you are aware of Sophos because for years we've recommended
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:30.120]   Sophos is online scan at SOPHOS.com to check for viruses and so forth. Sophos though is also
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:36.440]   something really interesting. They are using now deep learning, a very advanced AI technology,
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:44.040]   deep learning to fight bad guys. It's always been a seesaw battle between hackers and defenders.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:49.080]   Hackers come up with a new technique defenders find a way to fight it and back and forth.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.520]   But the problem is the hackers are fast and there's a lot of them and there are a lot of zero days
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.000]   out there and it gets harder and harder for security software to detect these viruses.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.600]   That's why deep learning is so important. It works like your brain with a neural network.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:12.360]   It interprets data and can respond to threats it's never seen before with blazing speed.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.920]   As he lab just ranked Sophos number one in an independent security test with the best
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.000]   protection ratings across the board for both large enterprises and small businesses.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.800]   So it's a very successful technique used in enterprise and now they are making a home version.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:34.360]   I wanted to tell you about it. It's called Sophos home for Max and PCs. It delivers real time
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.680]   protection from the latest ransomware attacks malicious software hacking attempts.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:43.320]   Malicious software hacking attempts and more plus it's very easy to use.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.240]   And what I really like about it is it's web based. It's a web based console. So you can use it to
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.960]   secure a single machine or manage a security of multiple devices not just in your home but
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:59.400]   around the world. One account protects all the Max and PCs in your home from a single console.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.120]   You can even use it to keep relatives secure even if they're thousands of miles away.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.080]   You can remotely manage their security clean up threats keep their systems safe.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:14.360]   This is real time protection that's smarter than any antivirus.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:19.880]   You know that I probably do that Sophos is tagline is security made simple and they've certainly
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:24.680]   done that with Sophos home very easy to use. You don't have to be a enterprise IT expert.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:30.440]   You log in from your browser. You start securing your systems today. So bottom line whether you're
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:36.120]   big enterprise like us you will we're not big business using Sophos or a home user Sophos has
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:41.080]   you covered some of the largest businesses in the world use Sophos to stay protected from those
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:47.000]   ransomware attacks last year. Some didn't those are the ones that lost a lot of money on ransomware.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.240]   Third party reviewers consistently rank Sophos among the best cybersecurity providers.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.560]   I refer to them in their Sophos blog all the time. It's actually one of the places I go
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:02.040]   to keep up on security news and Sophos now has a product that is remarkable. I want you to check
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:08.840]   it out S O P H O S dot com. You can get a free trial there at Sophos dot com. You can also use
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:15.240]   the security scan anytime you want that's free to Sophos dot com. Thank them for their support.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:20.280]   Leo I don't know if this is going to cause continuity problems but over the course of
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:25.400]   the previous two as I did shave. That's that's very confusing.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:33.160]   Exactly. I just started over get myself a whole show again. People are going to say wait a
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.000]   minute. Is it a different day? What happened? What happened? I know I understand the question
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.960]   you know I know I understand the whole conspiracy theory. The one time I shave the one time I shave
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:48.600]   is on Tuesdays because I remember back on screen savers there was a moment where Leo said something
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:54.760]   about Patrick not shaving for shows in kind of a way in a row. So in my head it's always like
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.600]   I should shave. You should always shave. Yeah so I don't always shave but I do.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:03.480]   Shave for when I shave. It's from Mac. It's just a little bit shave but when I do.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.800]   It's fun Mac. We're not great. We're an HD stream and I've got really good lighting
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.960]   and I and unfortunately I'm at least 20 years past the date when men who don't shave
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:19.480]   look dashing. I'm watching MSNBC yesterday and Ari Melbert comes on and I swear to God
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:24.920]   he does not shave before the show. He's like those baseball players who are going to shave after the
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:31.560]   game. Right. And it's it's just concerning. Maybe that's the new look you know you but it's not long
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.520]   enough to be a grizzle. Right. It just looks like you haven't shaved you. You shave the millennium word
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:40.360]   for it then it's then it's efficient. Yeah probably they don't word for it yet then there's no.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:47.000]   He's a hipster. He's probably got something going on. I don't know. Apple has according to rumors.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.600]   This comes from a pretty good source. So this guy named Mark Gurman anybody heard of him?
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:05:00.920]   Plans. This is in Bloomberg. Plans on combining iPhone, iPad and Mac apps by 2021. Now we're well
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.200]   aware of what's it called? Marzipan? Marzip. Yeah this is Marzipan.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:13.000]   So this is not new but I gathered I thought maybe I just misunderstood it. Marzipan was going to
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.480]   make it so you could cross compile. And if I'm encouraging people to do that. So if you're an
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:26.120]   app iOS app developer now you can use Marzipan to make a Mac version. But that's not so Marzipan is
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:31.000]   Marzipan is UI kit on the Mac. That's all it really is is moving the UI kit frameworks into a place
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.720]   where they can run UI kit apps on the Mac using all the Mac affordances like mice and menu bars
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.720]   and keyboards and those sorts of things. And the first stage was Apple putting out
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:46.280]   really terrible notes. They're off voice recorder. Yeah horrible apps. Yeah I think they know they're
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:51.800]   terrible. So you know they're fully aware of that. Stage two is this year at WWDC where Apple
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:57.240]   puts out the SDK for third party developers which means that Netflix and Twitter can easily make
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:03.160]   their iPad apps available on the Mac. People you know Marco Arma can make overcast. Greg Pierce can
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:08.200]   make can make drafts much more easily for the Mac rather than having to go through and make
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.120]   an app kit app. They can bring over a lot more of their logic and they you know on their data models
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:18.360]   all those sorts of things to the Mac. Stage three is bringing iPhone apps that don't already have
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:23.160]   iPad versions of the interface. Because you can already make iPhone and iPad universal binaries
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:28.360]   but not all iPhone apps have iPad apps. So they don't they're not quite as traditional looking
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:33.480]   as Mac apps. And maybe they'll run as like little widget windows which will make a ton of people
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.960]   super happy for a while. But the idea is if you just have an iPhone app it'll be super easy to
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:43.320]   bring that over and make it a Mac app. And then this will all wrap up in two things. One is a
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:48.520]   unified iOS store where you can just go in and buy an app and it will give you the iPhone version,
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:54.120]   the iPad version and or the Mac version depending on which devices you have. And a unified binary
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:59.320]   system that just like we have iPhone and iPad apps today will be able to deliver iPhone iPad
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:04.920]   and Mac apps. Optionally you can still build app kit apps if you want to. But if you are sort of
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.640]   a developer because there's so many more UI kit developers and there are app kit developers
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:14.920]   and so many more developers in the iOS ecosystem than there ever was in the Mac developer system.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.720]   And Apple wants to sort of harness them and make it as easy as possible for them to bring their apps
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:24.840]   and their technology to the Mac. So sort of this multi-year project to get that and to get Apple
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.640]   all of Apple's developers onto all of Apple's. So it's more like the old universal binaries when
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:36.440]   we went from power PC to Intel where you would have one blob and depending on what it was running on
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:41.320]   it would run one way or the other. It's not with different UI conventions that have to be factored
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:49.240]   in. It's not what I was kind of got the impression that well to ultimately Apple's headed towards
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:55.560]   a single unified not even universal but unified binary that runs everywhere.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:01.400]   That's not going to happen. You will have the option of making that if you are an iOS developer.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:06.200]   If you are a staunch Mac developer you can totally stay on app kit. We'll see what happens when they
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.120]   go. They won't deprecate. You don't think they'll deprecate Mac app kit? When they go to AR like
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:17.080]   five years after ARM who knows because iOS is ARM native and Mac OS has been resiliently.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:23.160]   It's moved from power PC to Intel. It's very likely running on ARM and
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.440]   Cupertino right now. For years. Yeah. Secret third life.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:32.920]   Right. I hope it doesn't work like universal binaries used to work where you're not even
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.800]   aware. The whole point of universal binaries is that you could remain completely unaware of what
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:46.200]   kind of CPU you had in that box underneath your desk. It would be such a terrible
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:55.000]   in a lack of taking advantage of an opportunity if Apple simply said that hey iOS developers
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.280]   you know how desktop operating systems are kind of dying. Well now you can actually make money off
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:05.720]   of these people before in the last years before they moved to the chosen operating system of iOS
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:11.800]   and you can create a not terribly well thought out or ambitious Mac app that nonetheless will
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.840]   work exactly like an iOS app. I really hope that's not what's going to happen when there's an
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:23.800]   opportunity to say we can create a real next generation desktop operating system or desktop
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:31.080]   interface. I still love my Macs but I have to acknowledge as a four operating system
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:42.280]   household between Chrome OS Windows Linux and Mac OS I have to say that the Mac is definitely the
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:48.440]   most long in the tooth interface I use of the four of them. There's just not a whole lot of
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:59.240]   there are a lot of 20 2005 2006 ideas. They're not many 2015 2016 ideas in it. And so I hope that
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:05.160]   this isn't just a way of I hope this isn't a way of transitioning Mac users excuse me consumer as
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:11.960]   opposed to pro Mac users into an iOS product. I hope this is a way to bring Mac OS into a new
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:19.240]   state of relevancy for 2018 and beyond. Yeah I think I agree with you there. I think
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:26.280]   Mac apps especially have really suffered in the consumer in the consumer sense that
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:32.120]   it was they were fragmented before it was hard to find good Mac apps you had to just kind of have
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.760]   good word of mouth and then you had the Mac app store which has just continually failed even since
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:43.000]   it's it's renovation it's a design change which is incredible it's still not generating kind of the
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.600]   the excitement that that the iOS version does and there to be able to kind of bring together iOS
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:56.760]   app developers and Mac OS app developers so that they can kind of cross cross platform their
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:02.760]   their content without having to develop for separate platforms as separate operating systems
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:10.040]   I think would be a huge benefit to iOS developers they could bring their amazing content to the Mac
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:14.040]   so that we could use their content on the Mac without it being a difficult thing for them to
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.200]   get through. Well in the in the iOS market keeps on getting bigger and the Mac market is going to
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:23.880]   continue to get smaller so so it does make sense to keep people developing across those platforms
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.400]   I think that the in the professional area I could imagine things not you know like the big 3D apps
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.640]   the you know those types of things could stay on the Mac for a while and I think that we may see
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:38.520]   Mac Pros for instance stay on Intel probably a little bit longer than some of the smaller computers
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.520]   that move to ARM so you know I think that this this transition will probably still take another
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.040]   10 years but I think that I mean I think eventually we're going to end up with a unified platform.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:53.640]   Well once we're all in the same chip architecture right which is ARM it's got ARM-ish it's Apple's A
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:12:01.480]   X architecture right. Um. It makes sense to have a unified interface it also responds to people
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.560]   say well why doesn't macOS have touch by now every other major operating system it does.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:12.760]   It also helps iPad because right now we've got amazing hardware with our iPad Pros
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:17.720]   and software that really is stuck in an earlier era you know iOS is a little behind in that.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:24.120]   I find myself caught between. I find myself caught between is like if the iPad had a mouse
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.760]   I would only use iOS if the Mac had touchscreen I'd probably only use Mac right.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.320]   You know I feel like I'm like what you want is between the mind right.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.800]   I just want a mouse because the problem is I can't you know I've kind of gotten a down to that.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.800]   You want more than a mouse you want better software too there are limitations in iOS software
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.560]   but I believe that a lot of those limitations in the iOS software is because the interface
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.600]   you know you just can't do with your fingers what you can do with a mouse.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.280]   You know like you and that is the there's a fundamental limitation by saying I can't
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:55.880]   have a precise selection. It doesn't make sense in in this day and age to have a mouse only or
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:01.000]   touch only. Yeah I agree. Environment you need both. And when you use a surface you go oh this is
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.640]   the way it's supposed to work. Yeah. No I love the surface too. Apple totally totally missed the boat
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:13.320]   without Mac OS is still a wonderful platform iOS is still a wonderful platform but it becomes
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:19.160]   more clear year after year that there is such a beautiful case to be made for having a desktop
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.160]   operating system or a laptop that has a touchscreen with it and that gets back to what we were all
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:28.600]   talking about just 20 minutes ago that sometimes you really do have to ship the thing and see how
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.560]   people are in interact with it even if it doesn't make total sense because after two or three years
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:38.920]   of seeing how people were interacting with touch screen based windows machines they were able to
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:45.480]   develop an optimized version of the operating system and and and chroma less which is the ability
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:52.520]   to have a really nicely fine tuned convertible operable convertible piece of hardware Microsoft
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:58.920]   Surface tablets which still have most of the things that make me feel like I'm covered with ants when
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.120]   someone comes to using windows but still you can't say that is a thousand dollar computer that can
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:10.840]   be very very good at everything it does it doesn't fit that bill so it's it's I mean Alex is perfectly
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:19.480]   right if I could buy a MacBook Air with a touchscreen or if I could buy a MacBook Pro that has let's
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:26.600]   say a hard dockable keyboard on it and a trackpad wow I would be very it would it would definitely
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:32.760]   keep me from tweeting about how it's possible that I will not be a portable Mac owner in the next two
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.480]   or three years yeah I mean it's Steven Sinofsky famously who ran office and windows had a really
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:41.960]   good tweet storm on this yesterday because he was in charge of managing the project of making the
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.360]   original I think it was started in windows 7 and went into windows 8 of making it touch friendly
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:51.480]   and he was talking about it in an apple context you know like we I want a touchscreen at Mac too
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.920]   but just saying touchscreen Mac even just putting a touchscreen in there doesn't mean that the
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:59.240]   operating system is going to work and what it really entails and I think he said it was three years
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:04.120]   of like crossing the desert to get to the other side and could apple do that and what would happen
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.520]   to iPad and iOS development what happened to the Mac in that time and what would they have in the
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.520]   end because according to him as much as everybody loves this stuff very few people use it for very
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:19.080]   very few things yet it requires an enormous amount of resources and investment from the company and
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.920]   he goes through four different strategies of what apple could do like juice me completely new just
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.080]   rip and replace it add this into an abstraction layer to an emulation layer because you already
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:34.920]   have simulated iOS apps on wind on the Mac and they're increasingly adding pointer features to iOS
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:41.400]   because of probably because of the marzipan project so all this stuff like it's super easy to say we
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.320]   want this stuff but when you look at apple google never had the traditional operating system they
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.160]   didn't have to put anything to the future Microsoft never had a successful mobile operating system
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:54.040]   all they could do was port the regionals of the future apple has both and that has that's a huge
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:16:01.000]   advantage but has a huge opportunity cost i think we get back to again apple's biggest
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.240]   handicap as a company which is that as the lonemaker of max they don't have the option of
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:13.720]   alienating so many of their people with such a radical swerve in one way or the other whereas
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:19.800]   again you can make a absolutely screwy windows notebook that five percent of the market is
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:27.160]   absolutely gaga over but everybody else is a gaga against and then eventually that five percent
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.960]   becomes ten becomes twenty becomes the majority and now you've got eight years invested in this
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:37.960]   technology it's a fully mature platform whereas apple when you see how how hard certain people who
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:44.440]   don't like certain hardware changes i won't name any names like me how we react when we
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.880]   regard something as a failure and you don't have an option of doing anything else
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:53.960]   yeah you don't blame microsoft when somebody makes a crappy laptop computer you
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:59.160]   blame the manufacturer that made the crappy laptop but in apple's case when crappy when apple
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.440]   when apple's crappy uh they get the blame because they're the only ones doing it yeah and and if
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:10.920]   you're only making a limited number of of certain models of things then then that's what we all have
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:18.280]   to have to do there could be you know another category of touch screen mac but you know then apple
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:24.360]   is like fragmenting itself again and then you know the tech industry goes hubbub over whether or
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:30.920]   not you know apple is eating it cannibalizing itself by creating a touch screen um desktop or
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.560]   touch screen computer there's so much more to it and everything you're saying is so true that
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:43.560]   if you give the software to somebody else and let them make the mistakes then then there's lots
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:47.480]   and lots of times when you can make the mistake and then sometimes get it right and then that
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.840]   that's really great hardware that that then that's what grows but in apple's case they don't have that
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:58.360]   they don't have the luxury of doing something like that one of the rumors is that the next mac book
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.560]   the really thin and light mac will be arm based and that'll be next year yeah credible that's a
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:07.560]   perfect choice that's a perfect choice because it's not a high power machine to begin with
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:14.200]   a thousand dollar device that's mostly for email facebook writing uh and let's be honest
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:21.160]   google docs uh and the ability to do it on arm that is a perfect test bed for the entire idea of
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:26.120]   having arm based macs those people are going to teach apple over the over would at teach apple
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:31.800]   over the over two or three years so much about what they need to do and to scale this up so that
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.520]   some of the mac book pro market for instance could record get their work done at an arm based mac
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.440]   had me until google docs in my battery life just halved andy
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:47.560]   i've used a number of arm based windows machines and they're sluggish and unusable
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:53.080]   but remember that's that's the qualcom eight eight in most cases eight uh 35 chip which is
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:58.200]   two generations old now i think the smaller top is the perfect first step like it is yeah totally
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:03.000]   makes us raffle to do that and i think apple because they do their own silicon can make and
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.840]   this will be very interesting can make it a nicely responsive doesn't have to be uh
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.600]   well the operating system would also be tuned for that right you know for that silicone they'll
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:15.000]   make them together right and they've got a lot of experience building for arm yeah not not only
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:23.400]   that but imagine a mac an apple tv sized box that runs a essentially a five hundred dollar
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:29.720]   black box version of that arm based macbook nothing so imagine being able to finally get
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:35.240]   max back in schools again because you can finally give them a desktop experience that
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:39.640]   really makes sense for them financially and they would also have all the opportunities of the safety
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:46.440]   and security and the stability of mac so it'll be the first that runs arm as like a prototype
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:52.280]   desktop arm based mac it'll be me i think of course i'll follow us leo if we have enough money
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:57.560]   left over from our foldable by all the armables those are really foldables are kind of going
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:01.480]   into their arm and they're like two thousand dollar phone and my five hundred dollar laptop
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:07.400]   it'll be an amazing world world world world uh a couple of other little ones and then we're
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   going to take a break for your picks of the week apple is reportedly closing two of its retail
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:21.000]   outlets in uh in texas and east texas because that's where the patent trolls live the eastern
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.480]   district of texas is uh where of a lot of patent cases go because they have a friendly judge and
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:33.480]   they have friendly juries uh in fact when when we were talking with a strategy with our law firm
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:39.960]   about uh the podcast troll uh we are we already knew that they had an office in tylor texas and
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:45.160]   they were about to if you know we'd have to go down there if they sued us there so apple has a store
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:52.520]   in plano and frisco both expected to close april the reason is if you do business in the eastern
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:59.080]   district you can be called to court in the eastern district if you don't then you can't
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:05.240]   yeah it's so brilliant because not not only for this admittedly practical reason but all they
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:11.080]   have to do is start like when people leave the web page for those stores open by saying oh we're
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:16.840]   so sorry we we love dealing with and we loved helping all of our customers in these two stores but
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:23.000]   because of this litigation environment that these four lawmakers are currently responsible for
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.120]   here are their phone numbers and email addresses we we you're gonna have to drive another five hundred
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:35.160]   miles across what i what i know our rattlesnake invested badlands it's the dallas galleria will
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:39.960]   be the closest oh well there you go we talk about badlands badlands well what i understand i
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:45.800]   understand the ship to them either like they're basically leaving east texas completely like you
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:51.320]   know you know it by directly from apple even on the website i guess not because we didn't have an
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:57.640]   office in east texas uh adam corolla who did get sued in eastern eastern district uh didn't have an
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.720]   office there but his podcast were available there so maybe that's all it takes i don't know
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:05.320]   i've turned off everybody's iCloud account that's in east texas
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.080]   now that'll get some comments yeah
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:09.480]   yeah
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:09.480]   yeah
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:09.640]   yeah
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.120]   yeah
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:10.760]   you'll hear
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:15.000]   enjoy your enjoy your lawyer dome everybody yeah
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.560]   apple has apparently according again to bloomberg and uh mark german been testing
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:27.480]   sleep tracking in the apple watch you know they never put any in i think there are
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:31.480]   some are they a third party sleep tracking apps yeah you certainly have all the sensors
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:37.000]   you need i don't want to wear a wristwatch to bed sleep plus plus okay uh but you can see them
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.960]   introducing this with a beautiful pajama band right away right away with the new sleep watch
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:47.480]   and i knew apple luxury pajama band you put it on it's so soft it's so it covers the underneath
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:53.400]   and then you just sleep and it's got battery life now it lasts you through the night you top it
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.760]   off while you're in the shower in the morning and you're good to go for another whole day
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.760]   i always wear my white
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:02.760]   because otherwise i can't turn off my alarm but the alarm goes off my phone my phone is really loud
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.640]   and i haven't figured it out so you turn it off from your watch and i literally just look down
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:09.560]   on my watch and i tap it go otherwise i have to go find my phone and it's that that will be
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.360]   so you sleep with your own lives yeah yeah
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:20.520]   i charge it in the morning when i'm like oh i'm like a battery is not even that's it's we i can't
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:26.040]   wear something comfortable i'm just used to wearing i want to watch all the time for
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.800]   decades so i don't i guess i don't think about you used to it okay you're just having it on your
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:38.760]   wrist all the time yeah yeah yep and i guess that sleep tracking would be for for you exactly i
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:45.080]   i couldn't imagine wearing something to bed every single night that i don't know that just is too
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:50.200]   much for me so for someone like me at the sleep tracking i need my sleep tracking to be like a pad
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:55.400]   on my bed or a pillow or something like that not something i wear on my wrist you need this
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:24:02.840]   or sponsor or no seriously because i have to say for instance yesterday i got an amazing
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:07.720]   sleep score of 88 the highest sleep score i've gotten in weeks today i got 60 and i feel it i
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:13.880]   could tell what what what what do you differently i don't know that's a good question i don't know
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:18.200]   off the oh come on that's what you're supposed to figure out right you know well why uh it is
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.120]   switched it from beer to clear liquor before going to sleep because that's good for me
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:30.280]   that's like i'll try it i'll try it uh so you can publish that tip if we get that as a sponsor i was
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:34.440]   sleeping uh better than i'd slept in a long time and i think it was because i started taking melatonin
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:39.640]   like four or five hours before i go to bed and that really did a small tiny amount three
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:44.440]   micrograms but it really does make a difference um i don't know maybe last night i got disturbed it
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:49.320]   was pouring rain we had weird sounds and i don't wind there's a lot of wind i think that's probably
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:54.760]   why but uh but see i know because of that and and i and i don't and while yeah if you're used to
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.840]   wearing a watch that would be a nice thing to have right but if you're not used to wearing a watch
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:05.800]   there are other choices and you know it is i i could see why people would want to track that uh
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:15.160]   apple vp of health dr symbol desai in an interview with nine to five mac uh talking ecg fall detection
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:22.360]   their relationship with the fda and more actually where was this interview it was with moby health
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:29.240]   news sorry uh i got the wrong uh source nine to five wrote about it and i can't find the article
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:37.320]   so i'll have to give nine to five sis synopsis uh credit here uh she says the feedback uh on the
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.080]   ecg has been pretty decent so far i've heard some cardiologists say yep i started getting ecg's
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.280]   mailed to me right away their biggest frustration isn't around so much getting the ecg because they
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.600]   found that helpful but it's that the health systems are still figuring out the right way to handle
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.840]   that type of incoming yeah that's for sure true right they don't know what to do with patient
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.560]   provided ecg's where does that go working with they're working with stanford and brian
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:05.800]   she's the one i mentioned previously like she's still a doctor she still does something like 20
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:10.440]   percent hospital time and they have that entire division stat like the marketing person is a
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.000]   practicing doctor they really want to make tools not for doctors but as doctors which i think is
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.360]   neat she actually brought that up she says as a physician i still see patients in the er a lot
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.880]   of times the questions we ask are what kind of medications are you on uh and so she really likes
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.440]   this new apple watch and health records initiative yeah because then she could see everything right
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.040]   away without even asking the patient she says we're very early in that journey he loves it
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:41.560]   oh really yeah he said his up he he loves it so you can do it now is available oh okay your your
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:46.440]   physician or group would have to be supported right yeah your institution whatever has to be set
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:52.760]   up with uh compatibility i'll have to ask you know i i'm i'm with kizer and they have an app and i
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.400]   could see my records there but it'd be really nice if it would uh if there were some central
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.000]   walks well can you imagine being wheeled in there in in pain and all you have to do is just tap your
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.720]   apple watch like you know if you decide you want to share your records they get all your medication
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:10.040]   your how you've taken it yeah what you're on your health records access to all of that stuff
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:15.560]   while you when you were in no condition to get it one now now when you're when you were unconscious
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.040]   can they still just sort of lift your arm and just basically tap your app watch against a pain
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:23.080]   against a i guess a pay console dude you have to guard against that you're
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.880]   prepared to guard against that as long as you don't take the watch off before you have the heart
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:34.840]   attack keep the watch on sorry with regards to fall detection she says uh it is the most one of the
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.000]   most common reasons for people to go to the emergency room not just with older people across
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.680]   all age groups i've gone to the emergency room three times for falling really i fell out of a tree
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.640]   oh i fell off a wall she says this happened to her going up on your step stool try to get some
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.640]   flowers sugar and having a fall and that happens so she's she thinks fall detection is very important
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.520]   i wish i could get to the full interview but uh moby health news is either pulled it down
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:07.160]   or changed the link because i'm getting a 404 when i go to that like barns are slippery
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.960]   as as red as red green used to say you you found the short way down off the roof
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:17.640]   i did it found the quick way right off the edge it was it was exciting this is it's too early to
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:26.120]   uh to celebrate yet but there is code in the ios version of google's home app that says apple music
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.640]   will be coming to the google home at some point it's not live yet it just came to the amazon echo so
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.600]   uh that would be really great it makes you wonder though what apples long-term plans are for the
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:42.920]   home pod if if all of these other guys could do exactly the same so i maybe really was about sound
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:48.680]   like they said yeah yeah no you're right no i i i think i think i's more to say about their plans
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.400]   for apple music that's it would be such a it would it would almost it would almost be a demoralizing
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:57.080]   thing for the team that works on it if they said that no we're not going to let we're we're going
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.240]   to make sure that this maybe remains locked into one hardwood platform as opposed to
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:07.400]   speakers that will absolutely blow blow this this home speaker out of the water or things that
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:11.960]   are that more people can afford it really is an endorsement of how good they think apple music
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:16.360]   is that we don't we don't need hardware lock-in to make it a success and we want if you got a
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:21.480]   speaker that's capable of streaming we want it on your device google's response to the article is
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:29.160]   we have nothing to announce regarding updates sometimes it's the worst of both worlds like you
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:33.560]   have situations where microsoft has to decide is it going to license exchange which is going to hurt
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:37.960]   their enterprise business or they're going to not license it which could hurt their overall revenue
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:41.720]   or blackberry with bez and with bbm and all these things and sometimes you make the wrong
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:46.040]   choice and sometimes you make a choice that hurts one and not the other but with this apple really
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:51.800]   never positioned home pod as a very cheap very convenient speaker they said if you just if you
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:56.440]   have a room with no sound this will let you take it drop it almost anywhere you want and have almost
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:00.920]   and have great sound almost anywhere you stand and if that's not the market for you but you have
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:04.440]   apple music especially if you have a family subscription you have a whole bunch of amazon and
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.080]   google and android and ios we want to make sure that that apple music family subscription serves
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:13.240]   everyone in your family then it becomes a much more enticing offer doesn't hurt high
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:17.160]   home pod because you would probably never buy that anyway but it significantly helps apple music
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:25.720]   yeah beautiful tribute to uh steve jobs on sunday from tim cook uh steves it was steve's 64th birthday
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:30.920]   last sunday steve's vision is reflected this is by the way a great shot starting with the uh with
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:36.120]   the reflecting pond steve's vision is reflected all around us at apple park he would have loved it
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:41.000]   here in this place he dreamed up the home and inspiration for apple's future innovations
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:46.840]   we miss him today on his 64th birthday and every day and just it's a reminder that he
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:52.280]   died he really died so young in his 50s and what a loss not just to apple but to all of us
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.560]   so uh happy birthday steve whatever it is steve's wherever you are
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:04.760]   um i just hope there's acid up there he's up there going these pearly gates are terrible
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.800]   what are you going to take these down we'll start again with aluminum
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:13.400]   yeah but i can't believe you call this heaven yeah that cloud is entirely the wrong stuff
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:19.800]   no he's got he's got a pure in a vision to johnny i'd say i'm sorry you're supposed to be on earth
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:24.440]   for another 30 years but i just can't deal with product design and have it anymore i'm just gonna
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:32.280]   take you over here now i would uh apple has another bokeh ad which is great but i don't want to show
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:38.760]   it because we showed last week we showed the bokeh ad and uh we were taken down really on youtube
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:44.360]   for showing an apple ad so so you're not getting an ad free ad for me apple if you want to buy one
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:49.000]   i'll be glad to sell you one but uh i like shooting it's like again that this is a law firm that was
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.680]   retained to do this stuff and they don't think like there's absolutely no thought involved in it
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:57.640]   oh i think it was actually i don't even i think it was a content id was it do we ever find out was
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:05.080]   uh karstin or anybody was was a content id or we do not know we don't know it's an automatic
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:09.880]   thing with content id but it but if it's uh but you can get a more serious strike from i think it
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:14.200]   happened to some movie trailers like google well first google lost its mind over the last two weeks
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:18.760]   with youtube like they are taking down everything well for good reason there's some
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:25.320]   really nasty stuff yeah it is but yeah no absolutely but the way they the way they detect uh like
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:30.280]   line us line us from tech tips had his own channels content id being his other channels yeah that
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:35.800]   was weird yeah it's uh and i'm not ready to blame apple for this so youtube's weird so the way the way
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:40.440]   at least my understanding of the way youtube works is that you can do nothing you you basically
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:44.680]   when you put your content into it as soon as you put your content into it hashes the video and hashes
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:50.280]   the audio so it knows what to look for and anybody's uh feed then you set the settings it's not like
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:54.520]   you set the settings for twit to be one thing and somebody else and there's no human that looks at
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:33:01.320]   it but then you say do nothing track it monetize it or take it down or strike it yeah you know and
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:07.560]   so sometimes like and what when someone hits you on a monetize they will you can't actually change
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:13.560]   your video so someone like there's there was one like this woman had a dancing on a uh you know
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:17.880]   at a wedding and there was and there was copy written music and that was set to monetize and so
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:22.840]   it got 20 or 30 million views and whoever's song it was was the one that made all the money on it
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:27.800]   and and you and it literally adds the ad to it and makes the money on it um so that's and then
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:32.040]   the ones that are cooler like the milie syrus is the turn off the edit things like you can
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:37.560]   usually you can cut stuff out does it turn off the edit button no no well it depends that's that's
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:42.120]   if it's doing if that's the strike if it's the strike you can use the edit button to cut it out
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:47.400]   um but if it's the monetize you can't touch it like you don't own that video anymore even if
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:52.120]   it's on your channel and then track is just you just you just know where your song or your
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:56.120]   thing is everywhere but you don't do anything with it and that's the folks that are most savvy
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:01.320]   use track but apparently there was a big problem with the ml and with a whole bunch of other stuff
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:07.560]   over the last two weeks so i'm happy to say i think maybe my mistake was naming the show after the ad
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:12.920]   why do you hate jacob which i thought was a great name also sometimes if there's a source like if
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:17.160]   it says source apple on top of the video they don't touch it or at whatever it is if there's no
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:21.320]   attribution then the whole thing is screwed i showed it full screen as if it was an apple
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:26.040]   i mean typically if you can just frame it in a little bit or over to the side i don't look it's
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:30.840]   it's just to be clear it's commentary it's completely legitimate use it's commentary we did
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.800]   comment during it and afterwards uh you know and we're a news organization so
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:41.480]   obviously we disputed it and it got put back up but uh that's one that's when i don't want to have to
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:45.720]   this is the uh discussion we've had it's apparently the butt i well it's not even painted but i i
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:51.800]   kind of resist the notion uh that we should give in to any of this because it's our it's our right
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.040]   to do it and so i just want to assert our right to do it but that's when you're seeing a human it's a
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:59.720]   computer until until you until you until you argue with it you're seeing the computer is just doing
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.400]   what it's told to do so then as soon as you argue with it then a human says okay what's going on
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:08.120]   it was immediately it was it was a i think immediately restored yeah that's that's that's why that's why
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.200]   tech laws are a lot like security updates where you can't just like and you can't just do the
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:18.360]   digital millennium copyright act in 1997 and then never updated right because in 97 the the exception
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:24.280]   that allows google to simply allow people to upload videos and if someone has if someone has
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:29.080]   their copyrighted content up there gives them the ability to simply have them strike and pull it down
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:34.920]   didn't anticipate that a would be possible for dumb algorithms to do it just automatically
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:40.200]   also didn't anticipate a world in which there would be a financial incentive for bad people to
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:45.640]   maliciously issue copyright strikes and that's why this is one of many problems that google is
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:49.640]   trying to deal with on google on youtube these days yeah and of course get ready because uh the
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.600]   eu the european parliament is about to vote on their new copyright law which includes an article
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.520]   article 13 that would require us and everybody else there's no fair use at all
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:06.680]   require us and everybody else to buy licenses for any copyright content we want to use
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:15.480]   and require people like youtube and facebook and twitter proactively to prevent anything
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.440]   copyrighted from going up there whether it be a meme or fair use commentary in a minu site
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.760]   and if that passes uh i don't know what we're going to do because almost all the
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:28.680]   the eu is not going to have any more video i think all of our content on twit
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:33.800]   audio and video is based on commentary of other people's copyrighted works
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.640]   i don't know what the hell we're going to do except most of this stuff is like it's
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.360]   almost everything is every every movie critic site every like just everything you write a
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:47.800]   article about pokemon go with images from pokemon go yes completely legitimately
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:54.760]   that would be taken down so um if you're in the eu and you want to keep hearing twit and read
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:59.800]   nine more and all the rest uh it might be a good idea to write your member of parliament and say
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:03.880]   one minute and i think those copyright holders feel like somehow those people are going to come
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:08.280]   back to that oh no they're they're in trouble there's not going to be content you're going to
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:13.400]   try well i can't do it no we're going to see a digital Brexit where i hope that these i hope
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:18.200]   that media companies simply say we could that's going to hear so much money it's going to cost us
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.840]   to implement all of this and and not only with technology but also in lost business here's how
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:28.120]   much money we we will lose every year if we just simply say that all eu states don't get access to
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:35.480]   youtube and we've we think that millions of people in the eu will say this was a dumb idea lawmakers
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:41.400]   we would like you to fix that yeah it's kind of a it's untenable it's a scary thing we're talking
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:49.480]   about it on friday the the good the good news is i'm starting to see uh activists in the eu saying
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.200]   because there is an election coming up we're not going to vote for anybody who votes for
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:59.560]   article 11 and 13 so uh that would be you know maybe maybe that'll get them to sit up and take
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:06.360]   notice if just every 13 year old in the puty pie army would vote against this 86 million votes
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:14.200]   that's never gonna happen hey let's take a break and uh if you would lory gill of imore.com
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:21.800]   that's me managing editor there rene richie of the now year old vector show at imore.com/vector
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:28.840]   happy birthday uh andi and not co of boston public radio w g b h and Alex lindsey
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:35.560]   who's his own man at alex lindsey on the twitter picks the core dot com
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:43.960]   he's his own man if you would prepare your picks i will tell everybody about my pick
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:52.760]   which is the amazing molecule molecular air purifier uh we moved to the country about five
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:57.000]   years ago and i had never had allergies lee said i don't think lee said had allergies
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.480]   she had allergies not to anything airborne anyway to pollen all of a sudden she started
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.800]   getting sinus headaches about three years four years ago on a regular basis and we looked for
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:13.720]   everything we tried all kinds of filters and she lives on a legra but we then we found the molecule
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:21.080]   the molecule is an amazing air purifier and it really works molecule has replaced 50 years of
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:27.000]   antiquated air purifying technology you've heard of HEPA filters that was invented in the 40s
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.520]   and it's really just a filter that filters particles out traps them and and stores them
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:39.880]   molecule uses pico technology photo electrochemical oxidation which goes way beyond the HEPA filter
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:46.760]   to both capture and then i love this eliminate particles one thousandth of the size that HEPA
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:52.280]   filters can catch so it's not just trapping them and storing them it's eliminating allergens
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:59.720]   mold even bacteria and viruses molecule makes it easier to cope with asthma and allergies
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:05.240]   significantly reduces symptoms it sure did for us one customer said after using the molecule
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:10.200]   she was able to breathe through her nose for the first time in 15 years suffer no longer the
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:17.240]   but the technology was funded by the EPA extensively tested by real people verified by third parties
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:22.040]   in university labs like the University of South Florida's Center for Biological Defense
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:27.240]   the University of Minnesota's particle calibration lab it's beautiful too it's got a cast aluminum
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:34.280]   body it's be you it's just gorgeous i can control it via Wi-Fi it also supports bluetooth it's also
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:40.440]   got a control on the top that lets you turn it on and off and you choose the size of the room things
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:45.880]   like that some people call it sometimes the apple of air purifiers it's so beautiful and it's so
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:52.920]   easy to change the pre-filter and then that pico filter that that that metal tube you see there
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:41:00.120]   and what i love if you do pair it with a Wi-Fi it was actually note the level and the replacement
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:06.280]   time and they'll ship you replacements just in time so you get it put it in because you know you need
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:13.560]   it it's awesome the molecule really works whisper quiet energy efficient and for a long time when
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.960]   we were doing the ads they were sold out i'm glad to say now they've stepped up production
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.320]   they're now meeting demand which is great so if you want a molecule you can get one right now at

[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.600]   in your air and the air smells great i have to say we were so glad we had the maulin but we liked
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:49.240]   it so much we got one for our sixteen year old in his bedroom we have one in the studio and we
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:54.920]   were glad because when they had the fires in us up north here it was so smoky in the air and people
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.480]   would actually come here to work just because they could breathe you couldn't breathe outside
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:04.840]   molecule maybe get one Leo yeah really you got one i got one i had friends who were in the fires
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:08.360]   and they they were like scientist chemistry friends and they were holding their detectors
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.960]   outside and they were blowing up and then holding it on the osmo and they were neutral and i go
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:19.960]   see it it makes a big difference m-o-l-e-k-u-l-e molecule dot com promo code is mac break
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:24.280]   let's get rene why don't you start it off with your pick of the week
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:28.760]   all right i was just pacing it in the docs i apologize karsten but this is the and full
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.480]   disclosure i haven't ordered this yet it is the osmo pocket and i've been trying for a long time
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:36.920]   to get better at b-roll because i'm doing the youtube thing and i feel like i'm okay just
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:42.040]   yacking at the camera but i'm not very good at b-roll yet but osmo you know i tried the different
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.960]   osmo things you put your phone on it you hold it and you try to steady it and i have a couple of
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.920]   those but i just i've never been good at it but the osmo pocket you can use it by itself you can
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.320]   also put it into like god mode by attaching your phone to it and a bunch of friends of mine a
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:43:00.520]   bunch of colleagues of mine got it and we had a big mobile nation's meet up a couple weeks ago and
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:06.200]   they were like three or four of them there and i got to see them in action and it's just so small
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:11.720]   so easy to hold so useful by itself but really so much better when you have your phone attached
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:16.280]   to it and you know if there is an apple event and if it isn't just come out gonna walk around
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:20.120]   with this and just you know look at news apps maybe i'd still be going to apple events if i'd
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:25.720]   had one of those in 2010 i know right yes yeah totally i mean it's just it's small it goes in
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:30.200]   your pockets easy to carry with you and it's got a lot of capabilities just for people who
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:35.800]   understand what it is it's a it's a gimbal which is a stabilizer with its own built-in camera this
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.720]   doesn't you don't mount your phone on it it has its own camera you can though you can mount your
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:44.600]   phone to do all sorts of extra things with it as well you can have the camera send the video to
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:48.920]   the phone yes yeah sort i think there's been other like dxl had something like that previously but it
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:56.840]   just and DJ i sells a phone sized gimbal the original osmo it's clunky i had this i loved it i
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:02.120]   couldn't find much use for it because i'm i don't know i'm an idiot so i sent it to o doctor o and
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:08.840]   jj stony's gonna do oh nice yeah he's gonna review for us for uh for hot for hands on tech but i
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:12.600]   what i shot with it i was really impressed by it's stabilizing it really does a good job
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:18.040]   yeah uh and this is exactly what because you know you guys know what it's like at any event when
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.880]   you're in that back room like you've got one guy streaming on twitter about to kill you another
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.640]   person streaming on facebook not even looking at you you're ducking you're trying to get past
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:29.800]   david pogo we'll put down that iphone for an hour to save his life and it just there's nothing else
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:34.920]   that you can do and something small like this i figure i can go around the giant broadcast
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:39.400]   people and just you know sneak all the footage and that's my hope no it's really cute it's really
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:45.640]   cool i love it comes in a nice case uh it seems pretty durable um it when it's time for me to take
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:49.640]   our uh shows on the road that's definitely how i want to do it i think it's really cool i'm i'm gonna
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:55.640]   order one i i the problem is is i have you know i have the last version of the osmo and i have the
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:59.160]   hick toy one yeah i have the big one and so i have yeah i have all those and so i've been like oh
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:02.920]   do i really need it but i've now had a couple friends like like rene that have used them and they
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:08.200]   just pull them out of their pocket and i'm like yeah no oh no and uh you know what i do a lot with it is
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:13.080]   if we're doing events and we want some b-roll um the guys are shooting i got guys with big cameras
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.840]   over their shoulder and they're shooting a bunch of b-roll and i just walk around and just grab a
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:20.760]   couple things and and what we find is that at number one it's i'm amazed that i can actually cut my
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:27.800]   footage in uh that and it still works um but the second thing is is that it is it's more intimate
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:30.600]   in a lot of ways because you're just it doesn't look like a big camera don't get everybody's
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:35.000]   attention and yeah and you kind of do little things behind people that you can't do with a big camera
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.160]   and so just don't get the depth of field it's about all of it but i you know i don't hate jacob so i
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:45.720]   don't don't need to both hands right four k six of frames that the rest of us know jacob no
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:51.080]   and uh here's an example in this image of how intimate it is you really could have a conversation
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:56.280]   and interview uh you know talk to somebody and it doesn't get in between you a smaller even than
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:03.320]   your phone really yeah yeah good i i agree with you three hundred fifty bucks uh our full review will
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:06.360]   be coming soon to hands on i think they have a bunch of accessories now i was just i was starting
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:11.320]   to look at it before you get it before you get it yeah yeah see i might have kept it had i known
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:17.320]   that because uh that would be fun to have they have that is that dog collar mount a actual
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:21.240]   purchasable item or something they just Jerry Rick are they like are you looking for squirrels
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.920]   Andy are you asking for a squirrel friend squirrel friend wants to know Lori gill your pick of the
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:35.400]   week yeah so i am a terrible artist i am terrible at drawing i cannot draw for anything to save my
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:41.800]   life so if you're like me and you have an ipad pro with an apple pencil and you feel like a
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:50.200]   chump because you can't draw it shadow draw is this fun little app that i discovered that teaches you
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:59.240]   how to just do simple line drawings sketch drawings um it it uh it does each line and then you just
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:05.320]   trace over it so it's kind of showing you okay if you want to do perspective it'll show you
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:11.320]   you know the baseline and the and the horizon line and it'll tell it it'll show you where you
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:17.000]   should put it so if you redo these over and over again then you start to learn for yourself you know
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.760]   how you should be separating the i you know how far apart they should be and where the ears on a
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:28.760]   head should go and things like that and it starts with you can have like really really simple um
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:35.000]   sketches that are just really basic lessons or you can go kind of to the max and go much more
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.920]   complicated and get you know like um movement drawing and things like that it's only you know
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:45.400]   real basic you're not learning how to draw but you're certainly learning how to draw better than
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:49.560]   i learned how to draw because i'm terrible at it and this has really just given me some great
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:55.960]   it's like tracing but it gives you line by line tracing instead of having to just like copy over
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:00.920]   something it'll show you okay here's what you should do next here's the next line that you should make
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:07.480]   so there you go and it's free to download and you pay for the lessons so i think the lessons are
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:13.480]   usually a couple dollars each maybe three ninety nine i think if i recall and then that set of lessons
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:18.440]   usually comes with like three or four or five um little drawing things to do with it and you can
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:24.120]   pick which ones you want i do need that because like you i have a pencil and an ipad pro and i
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:28.040]   can't draw to save my life you know i keep saying i would pay a million dollars for how to draw
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:33.240]   comics the marvel way for ipad pro if you're listening worm yes if you are listening yes make
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:39.560]   that rinae has a million dollars for you that's a Canadian dollars oh i think you said american all
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:46.520]   right andy and i co your pick actually mind tyson really really nicely with the pre with the previous
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:52.760]   one i bought myself a new little toy i bought myself my first graphics tablet from the mac that i've
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:57.880]   in i've had in ten years this is the uh whack them into those uh tablet actually this they make this
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:03.240]   in small in large sizes i got the smaller one because i could get a free of just 80 bucks uh it was a
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:09.080]   blue there's a wired version that's even less expensive than this uh and it reminded me of how
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:14.840]   unique and cool and actual graphics tablet is particularly if like me you're trying to be more
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:22.680]   ambitious uh and about creating artwork with photoshop uh because i i had hey i've got my ipad
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:29.160]   pro i've got an apple pencil i can even just like use that as a touch screen for as a pencil screen
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:35.000]   for photoshop or use apps that are directly on it i forgot the cool thing about an actual graphics
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:41.160]   tablet is that you can actual your hand and the pen do not get in the way of you seeing what it is
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:47.000]   you're doing uh because not only is the the the tablet on the on the uh on the table while the
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:54.440]   screen is in front of your face but also i for totally forgot that the pen actually hovers over
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:59.320]   the surface as you're drawing it and so you can actually see the crosshairs or the the the tip of
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:04.120]   the tool just sort of like hovering over until you decide to actually make contact and do something
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:10.200]   about it uh it has of course a cajillion levels of pressure sensitivity so that if you're doing
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:15.880]   like touching up a photo you press a little bit harder for like more uh more light to be dumped
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:21.320]   under the section of someone's face or for less sharpening to happen it also has multiple buttons
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:26.200]   on the side of it the other really nice thing about it again as opposed to whatever jury rig
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:31.080]   thing that i was using before is that it has five clicky buttons that you can define on the top of
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:36.280]   it so i can basically keep one of my hands what people like my thumb on one side of the tablet
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.920]   and just press one of these clicky buttons to switch between what the is this going to be an eraser
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:44.760]   tools on do what i just did or is this going to be an ink tool or is this going to be a selection
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:50.840]   tool uh and i'm having an absolute ball with it uh i bought it there you can the the wire cutter
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.120]   recommendations that i looked at was though they were they're recommending like the three hundred
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:58.600]   dollar version of this which is fine but it was more of an investment than i wanted to put in
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:04.360]   after not using a device like this for 10 years uh but uh but this is something you can easily
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:10.920]   afford you can easily play with uh drawing things freehand is now a really credible thing to do
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:16.680]   whenever i'm creating just clip art or just annotating something uh it's it's rarely been off
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:24.120]   this i've not i've not lost this pen in the two weeks i've had this because i'm it's always like
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:30.200]   right there on top of the tablet next to my keyboard because i keep using it and using it so i'm really
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:37.080]   really really happy with it nice and and and so and so wacom so it works with everything you don't
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:43.800]   have to worry about you're you also have to be tempted by these like off-brand tablets that cost
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:47.480]   less money and they're bigger and they have more buttons but maybe it'll work with what you want
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:54.040]   to do but maybe it won't but this it's wacom that the drivers work with everything scooter x predicted
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:59.160]   a pick for you Alex i know you're not picking it looks like you're playing with shadow draw i was
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:02.760]   i was just sitting there i was really cool with my finger i didn't have my pen with me it's right
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:09.240]   do you want to borrow mine i have to pair it oh yeah i don't know anyway can you lend me a pencil
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:15.240]   so he was saying i haven't the only reason i didn't recommend it yet is because i don't own it yet
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:21.640]   you're talking about the the new um reco theta yeah z1 so we we've owned the several of the reco
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:29.160]   theta's and this is a 360 degree camera but this is a expensive version a thousand dollar version
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:34.920]   that they say is their new top of the line one thing that intrigues me is live streaming in 4k
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:40.680]   and i almost attempted to get it just to see if we could uh what do you think jama you just set
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:47.320]   it up right here and people could be sitting well you reckon we wouldn't say area 4k we won't say
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:53.000]   oh it has four mics too which means it has surround sound should i yeah what do you think oh yeah
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:59.160]   that's a good one you're asking Alex i know i'm asking the wrong guy he's probably the best sub
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:05.960]   three thousand dollar um so i'm there but i've never used it i have the gopro uh one it's the best
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:09.800]   one under four out here's the thing is that is the gopro one takes a long time to process i own
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:14.440]   that's my issue i own both yeah it's a little i'm asking you so it's a little it's a it it it
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:20.120]   the one of the advantages of the gopro is that it has um nice stabilization stabilization is really
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:25.560]   good it takes a long time to process though um and i mean it's got wonky software i have to say i
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:29.560]   it's not this this is just like what you see you know is wizzy wig now i haven't used the z1
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:35.480]   but i have the five i have the sc i have the s i have the i have the n15 i have all of them and
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:43.240]   this has been the one that has stayed in my backpack before i've had some version of that yeah um
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:47.800]   you know i'm gonna get one as soon as it comes out it's the thing it ships in mid-April and um the
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:51.800]   the so the couple things there is that they've what they've done is they they're shooting
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:57.080]   4k 2997 that may not seem like a big deal but everybody else has cheated on that so
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:01.720]   say the the gear is shooting at like 20 they're all shooting at 24 not because
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:05.880]   24 is a filmmaking thing is because they can't get the processor to go fast enough with the heat
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:10.840]   and battery and everything else and so so theta has figured out how to do that the seamlessness of
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:15.080]   the theta is usually better than everybody else's what they're actually doing is going on there's
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:23.400]   two halves onto one chip and uh with mirrors little mirrors in there and um the uh 23 megapixels
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:31.080]   is 67 20 by 33 60 is a lot of pixels for an image uh and so and they're now doing dng raw
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.920]   so you're able to get a lot of data there if you're a computer graphics artist
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:39.560]   being able i don't know if their software doesn't but there's third party software that will do
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:43.720]   bracketing so it'll do you know 10 exposures across the theta and that's what i use the
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:47.480]   probably use it for as much as anything else as you set it out in a scene and you
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:52.600]   let it bracket you can build these hdr um domes which is how i got into doing it in the first place
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:57.720]   the um the video is great i don't i haven't i think that i'm excited about this one because
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:02.840]   the video has always been pretty good um and i've used it i think that the streaming is going to be
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:08.600]   pretty cool um how's their software the software is great because their software was so
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:14.520]   no no theta there's two things one is theta has a great software on your iphone um it's going to
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:20.760]   geotag stuff if you if you take pictures with your ipad uh or if you with your iphone controlling the
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:27.320]   theta it'll geotag all of those photos for you um that's nice it's it's uh so it has GPS and it
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:31.640]   no it's using your phones gp oh i get it so so you just know where those things are yeah
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:37.000]   uh the software is really good they've got an open api so that if you want to develop your own
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.680]   software to do it and there are the developers that that's why there's just that bracketing software
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:46.360]   was written by somebody else um a couple different people have written hdr um but you can write your
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:51.560]   own software in fact they have little competitions on how to write for the theta and so um it's it's
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:56.040]   it's the best all around uh and what i use it for probably more than anything else is i do i go on a
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:59.320]   lot of site surveys i go to places where i have to figure out how i'm going to do an event right
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:03.000]   in this space and i just hold it over my head and take lots of photos right then i just then we go
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.800]   back and we look at it later and i don't have to figure it out i like it that it has four
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:14.440]   quadrant microphones so you could have surround it's it records independently it says i've been
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:23.400]   doing a fair bit of ambisonic uh research yeah um and it it's a little oversold um you know yeah
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:27.000]   here's the here's the thing is that we we had a situation where we had a bunch of mics that we put
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.920]   out into the environment so let's just they're in an area where there's a lot of things going on
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:38.200]   and by moving the mics out into the world and then bringing them in and mixing them in 3d yeah it was
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:43.960]   much more impressive you do want a mighty soundstage it's not that it's just it's better to have it
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:48.840]   out there than on the yeah it's cheating admittedly you're kind of pulling sounds from different
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.160]   places and and where it gets really complicated is when you cut if you're building an edit and
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:57.720]   you're cutting between live between cameras you have to change that fate yeah change it so what we
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:01.480]   had to do is we had to tie our switcher into our mixer and so the mixer scene changes every time
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:06.840]   to be fair when you watch a ball game a baseball game in uh surround they have microphones in the
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:12.200]   crowd they're all over like a game on average game will have 20 to 30 mics that are that are
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:17.560]   field mics out there and so and those produce an incredible uh that's why the guy selling the
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:24.280]   peanuts is behind you and the ball hits the bat it's right there right yeah it's a good spatiality
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:28.200]   it's good but i this is the this is the best all around camera if you're looking for one i was
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:31.720]   just talking to somebody who wanted to do some you know some uh location tours
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:36.280]   and when this came out i immediately i wasn't sure i wasn't sure what the best one is right now
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.880]   and when this one came out i was like okay that's and they're obviously releasing it right before
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:43.800]   any being because this is a right and they're going for a professional i think but they're also
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:48.520]   finding it there's not a lot of consumers buying these cameras so selling at 350 doesn't make any
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:53.800]   sense anymore yeah so they're putting all the extra beef into it to make it more professional
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:57.400]   and they're selling it into a professional market and i think that do you think when they say it can
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:02.520]   stream live they mean it oh yeah you probably can i mean what it streams live so what is the
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:05.960]   temporal compression what is the spatial compression you know those are the things we don't know they say
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:12.600]   it's an excellent quality real looking image it's not real it's real looking
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:19.000]   i'm sorry i didn't mean i didn't mean a hijack your pick but i think scooter x said it should it
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.400]   should be once we get it we'll do a head-to-head with an ozo yeah yeah i would really like because
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:29.640]   that was what 30,000 $60 $60 well here's the best part the first one i bought was 60
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:35.480]   the second two were 30 each and the last three were seven and a half and you can't buy them now
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:41.320]   which is why i still use them still there the ozos are still the best live
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:46.440]   360 cameras yeah okay yeah yeah and so i wonder i mean now we're getting a thousand
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:50.600]   dollars something that's almost ozo quality it just not doesn't do stereo right so this you
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:54.200]   what i can't do with these that i can do with an ozo three three three three three
[01:58:54.200 --> 01:59:00.280]   three three sixty and i can cut it live and i have full control over exposure and stitching
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:05.000]   and everything else over a web interface i mean that kind of stuff is not what this provides but
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.360]   it's also a thousand dollars and you can put it in your backpack and so it's it's a great
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:18.280]   it looks incredible okay so rene you get the dji dji osmo pocket i will get the rico theta z1
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:23.320]   and then we'll just see what happens so this is an available for a couple months which is good
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:29.320]   because i have some folding phones to buy Alex Lindsey you're you're pick of the week so uh one
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:33.320]   of the things we do a lot of is we do we do a lot of live events and one of the problems you get
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:38.040]   into is you get to the end of the live event and your client wants to build a sizzle reel so they
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:42.040]   want to take the three hour event and they want to bring it down to two and a half minutes or three
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:47.160]   minutes or four minutes so what you have to do to do that is you typically take that video and you
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:52.440]   send it to a transcription company that you pay them about 200 bucks and then they sent two to
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:56.440]   three hundred dollars and they send it back to you the next day and you have your transcription
[01:59:56.440 --> 02:00:00.360]   and it's got time code and it's got all these little bits and pieces into it and then you send
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:04.440]   it to the client the client highlights what they want and then they send it back to you so that's
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:10.600]   the process by which it typically goes in um what this software does this is a software called
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:16.040]   simon says it does all that in the cloud uh or on premise if you have enough money i don't know
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:20.360]   exactly what the price is we haven't done it on premise yet so if you're doing working on a film
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:25.000]   you can do it there but what simon says here here is 12 for 12 and a half cents a minute
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:32.920]   um which is kind of incredible um you can now uh have everything transcript transcribed the
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:38.200]   accuracy we just used it on a project and the accuracy is very high um probably not quite as
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:42.600]   high as a transcription service but it is was planning for what we're doing it for what we were
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:47.160]   doing it for was you know to make decisions about that um but if you want to use it you can also do
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:53.880]   translations if you want to use do it uses for captions and and um you know other pieces like that
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:59.640]   it you know being able to do this cost effectively uh and automatically and then you can also bring
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:05.240]   it back in and have it reinserted into premiere and final cut abbot's a good price i mean i could
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:12.200]   do this show for 15 bucks yeah wow yeah i might have to do that yeah it's it's a really it's really
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:16.440]   powerful and uh and they've got a bunch of stuff coming that will make it even better but it's
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:20.920]   computer transcription i presume not human it is computer transcription and that's why it cost 12
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:25.800]   cents a minute yeah yeah so and it's uh so you can pay as you go and it's 25 cents a minute so if you
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:30.280]   want to test it you can do that uh but if you're if you think you know it's usually cheaper just to
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:34.760]   get the monthly um rate and then pay the 12 and a half cents a minute if you're doing any major
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:38.360]   amount of this um but if you're if you're working on the kind of things where you're shooting videos
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:43.400]   and you just wish you had captioning or you want to use it for assemblies or you want to use it for
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:49.640]   those you know um putting those things together it's it kind of uh it it's it's it's awesome wow
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.840]   so anyway that's my pick uh yeah i'm gonna send this off to Lisa this would be really useful for us
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:02:00.120]   yeah it's it's you can also transcribe and translate right yeah you can translate and one of the things
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:07.080]   to think about is if you're doing stuff for uh you know a lot of us think about it for translation
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:14.840]   you know or or or captioning for uh ADA right yes but um and it's required like if you're a government
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:19.640]   agency or your broadcaster you have to put captions in a lot of people now are putting captions in
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:24.280]   because a lot of people when you put a video up on Facebook or you put a video on YouTube people
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:28.280]   look at it on Facebook and if they don't see the captions they just keep moving on they want to see
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:34.120]   what is in the video before they commit to opening the sound will this print it onto the video yeah
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:38.520]   you can well what you know it'll bring it back to final cut and then you it'll be you can
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:42.680]   lower you can insert it as captions it's all time coded and it all just goes in can you do this
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:46.680]   closed captions i guess you could yeah yeah you can you can export an srt file and then that's what
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:51.240]   you need to insert into that and so and you can of course go you can have it exported out into a
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:55.640]   document you can you can fix little bits and pieces that you wanted to fix and put it back in
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:00.360]   so that's you know it is uh it's a very fast and effective way and again it nowadays if you're
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:04.600]   putting anything on Facebook you have to you really have to put it in twitter and to some
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:08.760]   degree uh youtube you want to have or in captions sure yeah you want to have captions in there
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:13.160]   uh i have the sound turned off exactly yeah and they're making decisions and sometimes a lot of
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:17.160]   people never turn the sound on like what we see as a behavior where people are watching for two or
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:22.040]   three minutes and they're not ever turning the audio on to that all the time yeah yeah mostly
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:26.520]   because that's the middle of the night i don't want to wake up exactly uh thank you that's a great
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:33.560]   pick simon says it's simon says dot ai and that is the end of that
