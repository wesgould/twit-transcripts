[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   As time for Mac Break Weekly, Renee, Andy, Lori and Alex, they're all here.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   We've got lots to talk about, including the Mac Pro teardown.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.400]   Yes, you can use it as a cheese grater, but don't.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.080]   Why the blind smartphone camera test produced the wrong results,
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.400]   and Apple makes $4 billion on a product you might not expect every single quarter.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.640]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.000]   Podcasts You Love
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   From People You Trust

[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 692, recorded Tuesday, December 17, 2019.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   The Digital Sputnik Voyager.

[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we get together with our favorite Mac friends
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and talk all about Apple Renee Ricci's here from the frozen north.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Beautiful Montreal, he is at imore.com.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   He also has the host of The Vector podcast at imore.com.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Hello, Mr. Renee Ricci.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I got some snazzy new Alex Lindsay style cyberlights behind me, so I'm just trying them out.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   You know what?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   They look great.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I did some huge shopping last night.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I couldn't push pull the trigger because I ended up putting more than $2,000 with a few lights in my shopping cart.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   But these are digital Sputnik Voyager's and they can actually animate.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I don't know how to do that yet, but you can scan in a photo and they'll animate to sort of match the photo.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's bizarre.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I want to get the ones that are synchronized to your video so that while you're watching TV, it does stuff.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I did that.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yeah, I wrote a little thing.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You don't need to anymore, it does it on a minute.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Analyze it, it would take the average hue of the pixels.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It was it by hand, like five years ago.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I'll be interested to see how they do it.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   The problem that I had is that I didn't even it out enough and it literally almost gave me.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I don't even get epileptic seizures from flickering, but it turned out that it changed a lot.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And if you're watching something like Indiana.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Too fast.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   It was fast.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It made me so stressed I couldn't continue like it's right.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It dissolved.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   That's Alex Lindsay, the Pixelcore Alex Lindsay on the Twitter.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   He is our video guru.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Although it's Renee surprisingly who said he would have bought the XDR if it were available today.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I like things to settle.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Did you get a pro Renee?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   No, I did not get a pro sadly.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   What's the brand name of those lights?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Oh, this digital Sputnik Voyager.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   That doesn't seem like that's a real thing.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   That's Laurie Gill giggling at us from iMOR.com.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   That's just not a real thing.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   He's just living in a sci-fi world.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I think it doesn't sound like why would you name lights digital?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Oh, yeah, that's the company.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   The company is digital Sputnik.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   This particular light is Voyager.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I heard they were used in the Mandalorian and that is all I needed to know.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Oh, that was it.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   You had me at Mandalorian.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Also with us from Baston.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Mr. WGBH Baston.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   No, WBR.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Where is it?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   B-U-R or WGBH?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   We are a two public radio station town here in Boston.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Aren't you lucky?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Andy Anaco.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Hey, who?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Radio's Andy Anaco.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Again, again, Renee has a YouTube channel with 150,000 followers.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I'm just making that leap into terrestrial radio with this point in my career.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   No, that's good.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Radio is coming back, my friend.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Exactly.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   The original streaming audio.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It is.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It is.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So the Mac Pro tearedown is on iFixit.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Wow, I'm surprised they spent the money.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   You don't really need to tear down a Mac Pro.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Do you?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I mean, it's just kind of...
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   It's pre-torn.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   But one thing we did learn from this at least, and I probably knew it before, was you don't
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   have to buy the expensive Apple DDR4EC RAM.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You can buy your own for considerably less.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Would you consider that, Renee?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Oh, look, they grated cheese with it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   This is not a good idea.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   What kind of cheese?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   That's what I want now.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Yeah, but how much fun that must have been.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I would say it looks like cheddar.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   This is why there's going to be a class revolution in this country.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   You spend all your money on these computers and ooh, ooh, let's great cheese with it.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Well, how about you give that cheese to someone who needs food?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That's why this is going to be a revolution.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I think that it actually would have done a pretty good job on permission.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   By the way, you need five-dimensional cheese.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   That's clearly a five-dimensional greater.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I think this is the video we've all been waiting for.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   This looks like a cheap Wisconsin cheddar.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Yeah, they needed something a little harder.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   What was it? A pre-apombed pre?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   They were cutting cheese.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I don't think it doesn't.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I don't think you could say it doesn't grate cheese.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The problem is it doesn't deposit the grated cheese where you want it.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It keeps it in the whole.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   This is just a terrible thing to do to a Mac Pro.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Also, you can't return it now.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I hope they realize that.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   If that was their scam.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And I like to confirm that it was cheddar.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It is.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   It is a beautiful orange cheddar.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   You know, cheese is not naturally orange.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I just want to tell you that, folks.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   They used it as a pretext to recommend their Halberd Spudger at $2.99
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   for cleaning the cheese out of the holes.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Just in case you want to try that at home.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I should mention I fix it is a sponsor.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   We use the Halberd Spudger here all the time and I highly recommend it.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   What else did we find out?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I mean, it's like, you can't really say it's a teardown.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Everything has buttons.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   There's nothing glued in as it should be.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.280]   So anything else you learned in here, would you Rene recommend getting cheap RAM or getting
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.760]   the Apple RAM?
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.000]   I think it really depends on what you want to do with it.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.600]   Again, there's a bunch of people, a bunch of my friends are all buying Mac Pros right now.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.040]   When they kind of work that they could do is very easily doable on an iMac Pro, even
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.400]   a MacBook Pro.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.600]   And for them saving the money on the memory is fine.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   It's great.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   It's not what they're doing.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   People who are buying this, they're not paying for it.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   Their studio is paying for it.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   Their clients are paying for it.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.840]   They have $85,000 cameras, $200,000 cameras.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.480]   Everything they're lights are $100,000.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.400]   And just buying this and having like buying 10 of them, having them shipped from Apple,
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.920]   they're just going to take the package deal.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.840]   So I think like for real, not, I don't want to call them real.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.240]   For the kind of person that Apple built this for, they were probably just going to buy
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.840]   it from Apple or they're going to buy in bulk from someone.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.480]   I think for other people, say of every penny you can, it's just an aspirational purchase.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.080]   For mechanics had an article on the fans.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.960]   The thermodynamics behind the Mac Pro, the hypercar of computers.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.080]   This is actually something Apple's been talking about for a while, but they designed these
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   fans.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.440]   They were actually influenced by, they interviewed Chris Lichtenberg, who's a senior director
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.640]   product design.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.760]   He is also a pilot.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   Flies a beach craft turbo bonanza.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.200]   He said they couldn't use off the shelf fans.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.480]   They would be too loud.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:41.920]   So they're randomizing the blades, the blade pass frequency, so you don't get harmonics.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.280]   In other words, you don't want the fans to kind of start all humming the same tune, or
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.680]   if they're slightly off, you'd get pulsing and sort of weird things.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:59.400]   They also said they were influenced by auto design with the fans.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:05.360]   Just one more little tidbit on this desirable vehicle that you'll never probably drive.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.240]   I know I won't.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.480]   They really want to sell the point that there is nothing about this that isn't well, there's
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.920]   nothing off the shelf about this.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.880]   There's nothing they haven't reconsidered.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.040]   There's nothing they haven't tested the hell out of.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.080]   Hopefully that concept will land, but they have to justify how many thousands or tens
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.520]   of thousands of dollars this thing costs.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.920]   Vincent LaFourette, who is the aerial photographer I've had him on triangulation, really like
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.560]   his so good photographer, also got his Mac Pro.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:43.720]   I think he also got an Apple loner, but unlike the YouTube stars, he didn't get something
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.800]   out right away.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   He actually used it for a while and wrote a very thoughtful article, even Mac Pro configuration
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   recommendations.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.520]   He shoots a lot of video in ProRes, and he was talking about things like he got a request
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.840]   for some video he shot.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.040]   8K, a client wanted it.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.000]   He was able to render it overnight in 4444.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.800]   He said that was just dramatic improvement in his ability to render.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.200]   Did you see Justine's tweet over the weekend?
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   I did.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   Do you want to show that?
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.960]   I sent some photos to Justine.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.760]   He said, let's throw these into a Mac Pro to see how they go.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.600]   She was rendering her 8K video.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   She had three 8K reds, right?
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.760]   But yes, she was running some 8K video, but in addition to that, I got her doing some
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.200]   photogrammetry on that computer.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   Oh, did you?
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   Oh, I didn't see those tweets.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.600]   If you look at the beauty that is the CPU usage, there it is.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.000]   Oh, I thought this was her own video.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.120]   She was doing her own videos, but if you see those pictures over there, that's funny.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   That's photogrammetry.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.600]   That's meta shape over there.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.040]   So while she's doing this, she's rendering, she's also doing photogrammetry?
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.400]   Yeah, which is why.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.400]   Oh my God.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   That's how you get 64 cores.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.560]   All 56 cores are being utilized.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.480]   And then in certain operations, it crushed the GPUs as well.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   That's amazing.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.480]   It's really fun.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.480]   What's funny is the rendering is one frame per multiple seconds.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.400]   So it's not rendering super fast, but I guess.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.000]   But that's the kind of stuff you want this for.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.800]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff that an iMac Pro or a MacBook Pro can do.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.560]   There's some things that you want those 56 cores.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560]   What is photogrammetry?
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   What is photogrammetry?
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.560]   What is photogrammetry doing?
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:27.720]   So the photogrammetry is I sent down about 140 photos of a square that I shot in India.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.840]   And so what it does is it reverse engineers.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.800]   First it looks at points in the scene and says, "Okay, these all look unique.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   They might have 100,000 points per picture."
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.280]   Then it connects those points.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.720]   It ties those points to other pictures.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.920]   This point is the same one as this one over here.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.840]   It ties literally tens of thousands of points together.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.520]   It says, "I think that these are all the same."
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.040]   And then it looks at them and says, "Okay, if all those points are what I think they
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.600]   are, this is where all the cameras were that shot them.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.720]   Once it knows where all the cameras are, it creates a depth map.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.080]   And then it drops points.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.080]   And then it builds models.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.080]   So it's literally--
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   So literally it builds--
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.080]   So the CPU intensive.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:11.240]   So the scene that I sent her at the settings that I sent would take my home computer.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.240]   And I sent her to the computer about four days.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   What did she not get laid?
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.240]   This is the program on the radio.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.440]   I have to get back to her and find out what the final was.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.440]   But I think that she was--
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.600]   I mean, it was literally-- I think it was eight to ten times faster.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   So what program is she using to do that?
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   That's called Metashape.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   Metashape.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   And what is she using to edit?
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.360]   It must be Final Cut.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   Because you really--
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   Yeah, she was using Final Cut.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.640]   You wouldn't want to use anything but Final Cut.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.800]   Especially out of the gate, it's going to be optimized because those two teams are probably
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   talking to each other.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.200]   So this is her unboxing video that she shot with three reds.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.400]   She's, by the way, she's doing a multi-cam edit, right?
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.360]   Of 8K while she's doing the--
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.640]   While she's doing the photogrammetry on it.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   That's kind of--
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   It's going to push it.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   All right.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.840]   Well, you know, you might as well.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.080]   If you break it, it's going back to Apple anyway.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   Better to break it now.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.960]   Right, then later.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.280]   Lafore was very positive about it.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.280]   He felt like this was a very good purchase.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.360]   For him, I don't think he's using a review unit.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.860]   But he does do-- I think he was very clear he was going to buy it, whether he got the
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.800]   review unit or not.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:29.520]   The level he recommends for photographers is a little less expensive, 88.99 with the
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   2.3--
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   That's the iMac Pro, right?
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.520]   Oh, that's the iMac.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.520]   Sorry.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.520]   Yeah, the Mac Pro 11.499.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.520]   3.2 gigahertz, 16 core, 48 gigs of RAM.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.480]   2 terabyte storage.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.760]   And then for the red 8K filmmaker, you might want to spend a little more $14,799 to get
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.600]   16 cores, 96 gigs of RAM.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.720]   My favorite screw to the day was Andrew Edwards, who's just arrived this morning.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.160]   And he said they will make me sign for a $5 case, but they just left the box with a point
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.160]   on the curse.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160]   Oh my god.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   Whoops.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.200]   Oh, man, your hearts and your mouth, then, when you come home and see that.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.240]   God, what if that had been stolen?
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   Oh my god.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.800]   Oh, what if the thief is actually kind of savvy and realizes, OK, this went from petty
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.520]   larceny to a felony larceny real damn quick.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.520]   Where was that house?
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.320]   How quickly can I paint my car brown?
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.120]   I don't think anyone can bring it back.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.560]   I hope the glitter bomb guy gets one of these boxes.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.760]   Oh, it's a glitter bomb.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.760]   It's probably heavy to get away with elegantly.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.400]   Yeah, I imagine anything.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   It looks like--
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   You'll open the door and say, what are you doing?
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.760]   Give me a few more minutes, buddy.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.760]   He's--
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   I don't know.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.360]   I've had people steal entire ferns off my front porch and nobody has said anything to them.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.760]   So I think people just don't look at that kind of thing.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.280]   They stole the porch.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:58.320]   He says, if I had to pick one word to describe the Mac Pro, it would be effortless.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.160]   It's actually fun to work on.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.440]   It feels like it works with you, not against you.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.800]   He was really, really positive in his review.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.640]   I really like the way he breaks down the different categories of people and the suggestions on
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.800]   what kind of Mac they should get.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.200]   And also, none of these recommendations were the fully specced ones.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   So it's a real--
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   Right.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   It really is for reals.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.400]   It doesn't exist yet, right?
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.920]   I don't think the specced out option-- well, the middle graphics cards don't exist yet
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.480]   and the eight terabytes don't exist yet.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.200]   So you couldn't get it if you wanted it.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.800]   No, no, sadly.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:41.920]   He does say that the benchmarks he has aren't the ultimate because software doesn't fully
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.640]   support metal yet.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:50.000]   So he thinks once he gets metal capable programs, there's going to be a significant difference.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.200]   Well, it should be cool, because Final Cut just moved over to a metal engine.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.720]   I believe he does use ProRes.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.120]   So if he has that afterburner card and he has Final Cut on metal, then that should just--
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.760]   He might be doing one of those arrayed red things where it's like nine camera slate together
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.760]   craziness.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.040]   But I think for normal red footage, everything is going to scream.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   It's fast.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:18.760]   I mean, 14 minutes for the Mac Pro compared to four hours for the MacBook Pro, it's fast.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.760]   And it's an ASIC.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.920]   So they can improve that afterburner card.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.720]   They can push out updates for it constantly.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   Right.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.360]   This is a 14 minute red 8K file and DaVinci Resolve.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.680]   DaVinci does not yet have metal support.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   And so the--
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.040]   It has better grading, but no metal.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.960]   Almost 15 minutes for the Mac Pro.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:43.880]   Actually I'm pleased the MacBook Pro 16 inch with the four core Intel processor was 52
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.280]   minutes, so it's still pretty good.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.280]   It's in there.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.800]   iMac Pro came very close at 17 minutes.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.680]   But you know, when you're Vince LaFoure, you need whatever you can get.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.480]   We were joking about Marquez carrying his iMac Pro with him to events and stuff.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.840]   Some people take your PC's to coffee shops, but he said he can't finish.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.800]   He's still finishing an hour as an overnight on a MacBook Pro.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.160]   It is an important point though.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.400]   You're not going to see the full speed unless you have apps that are multi-core and if they're
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.200]   graphics apps that are metal capable, that's going to make a big difference.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.800]   Excel is not going to go any faster.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   No.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   What about a pivot?
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.040]   We have a really heavy calculation in there for Excel.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.160]   That bears talking about.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:37.040]   Are they-- has Apple made this amazing killer, knocks on the back door of Best in Class desktop
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:44.400]   PC for a relatively small niche part of the market while leaving a gap for people who
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.680]   just need-- for like developers who want more power, they certainly want to be able
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.480]   to build their apps faster, but they want more flexibility than they can get in an iMac
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.800]   or a Mac Mini.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:03.200]   Like would they have been better serving the Mac community by making a Mac Pro with a high
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.440]   ceiling of let's say $10,000 in this maximum configuration, but which suits more people?
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.360]   I think that they just had to-- the problem was there's a lot of us in the production environment
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.760]   that really felt like we were going to leave the Apple platform completely.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.520]   Like I just assume that there was a certain amount of time before I was going to have
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.280]   to stop using Macs at work because the work that I'm doing requires more CPU than anything
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.160]   that Apple was putting out, anything that the trash can can do.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.000]   And so the problem really is that I was already doing more and more work on PCs because Apple
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.200]   didn't have a solution and because they're the only ones that make that hardware, them
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.680]   not having that high end because I was building PCs, building PCs from scratch that are 20
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.840]   and 25-granted components to do four GPUs.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.760]   And so even some of those had more GPUs than this one will take.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.640]   But the point is that we need to have that upper end.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.960]   And I don't know how many people-- like when you think about it, Apple has-- there's not
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.880]   a lot of gaps in my opinion.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.840]   People might have assumptions about what they feel like they want.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:13.000]   But from the Mac Mini to the top end Mac Pro, there's a pretty even gradation of what is
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.040]   available all the way up, especially if you consider the Thunderbolt 3.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.640]   Does it core like closely to price as well?
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.640]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   I mean, I think that you look at that from the Mac Mini to the--
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   That was for years.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.640]   That was the selling point.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.760]   I always told people that.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.680]   The good news about Apple is pick your budget and then you'll find something--
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.120]   And right now you can take a budget from about $700 all the way up to $60,000.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.120]   You know.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.400]   The cool thing-- I'd forgotten this, but Jason Snell mentioned it on the talk show that
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:44.680]   they were showing someone who did Hollywood soundtracks at WWDC in the lab across the
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.680]   street.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.400]   And they said it took them four machines to have that one soundtrack previously and
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.440]   they could load the whole thing up into RAM on the Mac Pro.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.480]   And that was just a huge productivity win for them.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.400]   So it's like there's video, there's audio, there's a bunch of categories that I think
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.840]   Apple's Pro workflow team just said these are the bottlenecks that we need to solve.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.480]   And this machine was expressly designed to solve for that.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.720]   So the technologies in it I think are going to filter down and then we're going to just
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.600]   see better Mac minis and iMacs and things like that over the next couple of years.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.120]   I think one of Apple's concerns had to have been seeding that entire industry because
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.880]   when you work at a visual effects firm you never saw Macs.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.560]   Not in the recent-- We abandoned Macs.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.720]   We went to Dell Precision Workstations with Premiere when the big change with Final Cut
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   happened.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   Right.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.360]   But I mean like for instance Maya is built on a Mac and a PC but you would never in a
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.200]   large firm work on a Mac because it's just not powerful enough.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:46.680]   And so having hardware, I mean the one chink in the armor here is the lack of Nvidia cards.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.000]   So their answer to that because I did ask about that, their answer is that because they
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.960]   still can't work with Nvidia basically they still want to write to the metal and Nvidia
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.700]   still says no.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.680]   Is there getting all those companies to port to AMD and I think they showed a list and
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.800]   it was-- this is two problems.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.120]   There's people who want the specifics of Nvidia that they can't solve but there's people
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.920]   who just want the apps that they want and there's people who want certain kinds of
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:13.120]   performance and they think that they can meet by the end of this year which is around
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.520]   now they should be able to meet both those other criteria.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.720]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.480]   I mean I haven't had to deal with it for a couple of years so it may have gotten better
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.960]   but you know the big problem that we had with the-- what was the ATI and now AMD and Nvidia
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:32.000]   was just the way that they handled-- the way that they packaged up the processing is that
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.320]   the ATI cards or AMD cards would break them up in much smaller pieces and it just made
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.480]   it much harder to do the calculation than within Nvidia and it was much more driven
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:47.440]   towards games where Nvidia had you know was-- had a better management of the overall process
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.920]   from a visual effects perspective.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.480]   Can you still use an EGPU?
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.320]   I mean you wouldn't with obviously with a Mac Pro but if you have a Mac Mini--
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.320]   I don't think so.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   Not with Catalina.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   Catalina--
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.840]   I think you just have to wait right because someone-- some 14 year old is hacking those
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   drivers right now.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.080]   Nvidia said we're not going to do any more drivers for Apple so I know you were able
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.960]   to use Nvidia cards with Nvidia drivers in an EGPU for a while.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.520]   But I don't think it was as efficient.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.480]   You know I think that it was kind of a hack.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.480]   Okay.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   Well now they wouldn't--
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.280]   Well now either even with their drivers they wanted you to write to their CUDA cores.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   Right.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.280]   So--
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.280]   And it'll probably work for-- and it's not that it's unworkable.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.600]   It's just that it was definitely unfortunate.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.720]   Can AMD make better graphics processors?
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.720]   I think they can.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.400]   I mean I see this as a market and they've got Apple now 100%.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   It might be worth it.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.920]   Maybe hopefully they'll build ones with the kind of horse malware.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.560]   So it'd have to come for both directions.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.520]   Software developers would have to start supporting it and then--
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   Well no.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.880]   Software developers technically-- and Renee you can correct me if I'm wrong but--
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.320]   Technically the software developers only have to support metal and then--
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.440]   Like they write to metal and then Apple should be able to take full advantage of the card.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.440]   I mean that's the whole idea.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.240]   You want better metal support from AMD is what you want.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.240]   Yeah you just--
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:07.320]   Where Apple needs to do that and then AMD just needs to build beefier cards.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.680]   Like one of the things that AMD is doing for example is when Apple wants to go to VR they
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.280]   just move everything out of the way and they write directly to the card in machine language.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.360]   And that apparently other vendors aren't so excited about those sorts of things.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.720]   But AMD will literally let them do whatever they want with that hardware.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.480]   You know AMD it strikes me that this is an opportunity for AMD.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.600]   You know with the Ryzen they've really shown that they can beat Intel at their own game.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.200]   Nvidia is saying we're not going to support Macs.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.000]   There are a lot of Mac users now who want these Mac Pros.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.840]   I think this is an opportunity for AMD.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   It does.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.840]   They've got it.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.080]   Maybe it's a resource issue for them as well but I would guess Apple would like to help
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.080]   them.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.280]   You think Apple will take the silicon over and eventually just do their own GPUs?
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.440]   I don't think so.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.440]   They don't want to do that.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.920]   I just think that it's a lot.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   I mean it's a lot--
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.920]   It's a lot to do.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.120]   It's a thousand chip engineers.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.280]   It's just that it's not a big one.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.280]   They won't sell a lot.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   It's a scale.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.280]   It's not good.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   Right.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.720]   From Apple's perspective the big money is in their iPads and iPhones and maybe they're
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.720]   laptops.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.720]   Which have Apple Silicon.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   Embedded graphics maybe.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.720]   Like they might take over the embedded.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.280]   If they go to ARM Macs they'll probably do their own GPUs because they're already making
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.160]   their own GPUs for the iOS devices.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.760]   But discrete GPUs I think that's hard to identify.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.760]   Yeah I don't think that's a good thing.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.760]   You're saying Andy?
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.640]   No, it would depend on what's a problem they're trying to solve.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.240]   I don't know what problem that they would solve by making their own desktop great GPUs.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.040]   They would have to buy a lot of companies.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.880]   Buy a lot of people to gain lots of experience even get off the door with that.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.040]   It's not just having the capability.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.400]   It's having the knowledge and the relationships that matters.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.200]   And I don't know what kind of a problem they could solve by manufacturing their own GPU
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.920]   that would be worth everything they would have to do to even be capable of doing something
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.720]   like that.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.760]   So what I was thinking our chat was putting out something important which is that AMD GPUs
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.680]   are used in the Xbox.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.160]   I think in the PlayStation as well.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.160]   So that's a big market.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.800]   Well they've always been that way.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.160]   Again they work really well in a game environment.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.560]   The way that they build the way that they use work really well.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.040]   It's just different for the pro environment.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.040]   Different stuff.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   That's the issue.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.040]   They're built for games.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.040]   Originally.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.280]   Because that's the market right?
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.840]   That was the market that they got.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.080]   They really leverage that market as well.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.520]   I mean they would pay game makers to say at the beginning of the game works best with
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   the video.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.520]   They did.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.520]   They did.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.520]   But there was a huge Nvidia market in the pro area.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.880]   A lot of the really heavy lifting is something that they were kind of...
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.680]   It's not a better technology than metal no.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   No I don't think so.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   Right.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   Metal is better.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   For a map.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.960]   But Apple went with OpenCL for a while.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.520]   And that was maybe a dead end.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   Is that why they're a little...
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.680]   Metal has the advantage that you can...
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   It's...
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.480]   I forget heterogeneous and homogeneous.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.640]   But they can target anything.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.320]   They can target the CPU, the graphics card, the T2 chip on a Mac that has it.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   And they can handle all that.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.640]   If they can figure out like, "Oh, this sucks at H.265 will offload that."
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.640]   And they just handle all that.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.080]   So you don't have to worry about it.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.160]   It's going to be a lot easier for developers to get the most performance out of the computer
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.320]   to just write to metal.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.600]   You know, there might be a handful that could write straight to the...
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.520]   You know, straight to the card.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.240]   But you're going to get the most power out of...
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.400]   Like Dustmuller and Lauren Richter and a couple of people.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.040]   The other thing to maybe think about is that if Apple really is serious about self-driving
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:33.400]   cars or just building the boxes for self-driving cars, that is NVIDIA's gift.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.400]   That is the thing that NVIDIA like, "Wow, we didn't realize that we were in the self-driving
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:41.800]   car business, but apparently we are because that's taking visual input from cameras and
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.440]   processing them and making them into 3D understandings of the world is really the GPU intensive
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.360]   thing of the 2010s and 2020s."
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.440]   So if Apple really is serious about doing that, they might decide that there's nothing
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.280]   off the shelf or nothing that they...
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.600]   If nothing that they want to build a better relationship with NVIDIA over, they may as
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.280]   well start from scratch and create their own GPUs for that project.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.800]   And that might filter down into desktops and laptops.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:13.400]   Speaking of the T2 chip, interesting story in 9 to 5 Mac and Pat and Lee Apple.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.720]   Apparently, Apple has just gotten a patent for the fingerprint reader in the new MacBook
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.120]   16-inch.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.160]   Up to now, fingerprint readers on iPhones have been capacitive.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.440]   It is an optical sensor.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.120]   And it works very well, I have to say, on my 16-inch, it's just as fast.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.440]   I didn't even know that was a different kind of sensor.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:41.800]   This might be telling, perhaps optical under screen sensors might be coming to the iPhone
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.760]   as well.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.040]   So they got a patent on it.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.920]   It's already in the MacBook 16.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920]   What do you think...
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   That's the room that was...
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   Yeah, that was the room that came up.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.080]   That there would be...
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.800]   In the not too distant future, there would be phones with Face ID and Touch ID.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.840]   And the Touch ID would be optical like that.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.880]   So there would still be no physical home button, but there would be a way for you to use your
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.400]   finger to unlock your phone.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.840]   So yeah, I see that coming, especially now that we're looking at a patent.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.680]   That means we're looking at evidence of them working toward that.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   Well, they have it.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.480]   And with the 16-inch MacBook Pro having it already existing.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.040]   And my experience has been it's very fast, very accurate.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   It does a great job.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.240]   It's just as good as the capacitive Touch ID was on the iPhone, for sure.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.160]   I love it, by the way.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.440]   It was gnarly for a couple of vendors, for a couple of models for a while, but it's gotten
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.440]   way better.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.440]   Oh, I'm glad.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.440]   Yeah, like some of them.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.240]   And I think Qualcomm just introduced an even newer version of the ultrasonic as well.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.720]   It just takes up way more space.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   So it's...
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.320]   Because you don't see the physical target, like a virtual target, and people were getting
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.040]   false readings or it wasn't taking an accuracy.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.960]   So now they're just making them bigger and bigger.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.480]   And hopefully it'll be so big at some point that it won't really feel like it's a sensor.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.640]   It's just I'm picking up my phone and it's unlocking.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   I'm very happy.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.960]   By the way, that's 16.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.720]   This morning, I was using it at breakfast and I sent a Slack and Slack has that kind
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.320]   of like the male whoosh, but it has a elaborate stereo whoosh.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.360]   And Chris said, "What the hell's that?"
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.320]   She thought it was like a jet airplane ticket.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   The speakers on that thing are so good.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.560]   And I said, "It's the speakers on this MacBook.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.560]   Listen."
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.560]   And I played some music.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.040]   It's just mind bogglingly good.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   I have to say...
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   I went back to the...
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.040]   Go ahead.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.280]   I went back to the butterfly one because I had to get a bunch of files off.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.280]   And I was like, "What am I typing on?"
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.280]   It's only between...
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.280]   Yes!
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.280]   My brain already says that.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   Thank you.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.280]   This is...
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.400]   Well, it's so funny how your brain just resets normal on you.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.760]   And then everything else that was normal is just totally abnormal now.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.360]   And I was like, "I don't know if I'm going to like this as much.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.360]   I really like..."
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.200]   And I'm like, "No, I'm not going back anymore.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.480]   I'm all in on the new one."
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.960]   And I've reconfigured my touch bar because even though they moved it away from the keyboard,
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.960]   I kept hitting it.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.160]   I seriously would launch or my calendar would launch something.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.200]   And I've recommended a better touch tool.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.440]   If you have a touch bar, you just have to have a better touch tool.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:10.440]   And there's a chaos configuration for better touch tool.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   Installed that, turned a bunch of stuff off.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:18.200]   And now I have lots of information on my touch bar and nothing I can hit that will launch
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   anything.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   That's so much more helpful though, right?
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   And it's great.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.000]   It tells me battery, it tells me my next calendar, it tells me weather.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Yeah!
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.800]   And if I press a key, I can get one thing I do that I can touch is the window snapping
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.960]   and the full screen.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   I do that a lot.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.160]   I'm moving windows around and stuff.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.640]   And that's just really handy.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.800]   So you can...
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.640]   I revised my opinion of the touch bar.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   If...
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.680]   I mean, Apple as shipped, it's not very good.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.440]   But if you take some time to configure it with better touch tool, it's actually pretty
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.440]   good.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.760]   And then I can press the function key to get function buttons.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.040]   I can press the command key.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.840]   I can see my dock, which is awesome.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.200]   If I press the command key, it shows my dock.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.160]   So if my dock's hidden, it's a very quick way.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.760]   I really am very happy if you add...
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.760]   It's the chaos...
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.760]   Chaos...
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.760]   Cameron, what it's called?
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.080]   Chaos Theory, something plug-in for touch tool.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   That's really good.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.080]   Is that what you use, Renee?
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   I just...
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.680]   Yeah, I just like the informational stuff.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.440]   I haven't changed this one yet because I use it as normal and final cut.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.480]   And Safari, I still haven't found anything that lets me scrub faster than the touch bar.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.120]   And I'm so used to scrubbing on iOS.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.460]   Now it's very easy to go through tons of tabs or tons of timelines with the touch
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.560]   bar, but I will eventually install it again.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.560]   Better to get my dock.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.960]   And it's Golden Chaos is the name of the UI replacement.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.760]   It's a free download.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.240]   Somebody spent a lot of time.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.480]   And the only negative on this is you will look at it and go, "Oh my God, look at all
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.480]   those things."
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.800]   But the default setting is pretty good.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   And then I literally went through it and just turned off anything that I might hit by
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.960]   accident because I just don't...
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.320]   That's the biggest problem I have with that touch bar.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:58.260]   I'm a little bit disconcerting that a developer will have both the impulse and also the commercial
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:04.140]   viability to create something known as the complete UI replacement for something that
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.140]   Apple developed.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.140]   It's always the case.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.300]   It's like the Indies code circles around Apple.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.620]   Like Apple and Google and Microsoft have all this money and I've never found an India.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.500]   It just codes circles around them.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:20.020]   You know, the hard part with any large corporation is that there's a concern around brand.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.500]   There's a concern around what it's going to look like and how it's going to work and
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.500]   that generates a whole bunch of meetings.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.500]   It's committees and meetings.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.500]   It's committees and meetings.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.100]   And there's product management and so, you know, I was talking to someone about, you
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:35.300]   know, we built a bunch of tools and the fact that I could call my developer one day and
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.260]   tell them, "I need this changed and the next day it's working."
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.540]   You know, you can't do that in a big company.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:45.460]   That's three weeks or three months of development and meetings and millions of dollars.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.460]   And it's just a big chip.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.820]   You can do things in a rowboat that you can't do in a tanker.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.820]   Yep.
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.100]   There's also like the rest of the world to consider.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:00.860]   And you know, if Apple is creating a user experience on the touch bar, they have to
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.660]   take everyone into consideration and they can't be niche about it.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.380]   Whereas something like Better Touch Tools, that's like me as the user am choosing to
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.780]   download this very niche thing and using these very specific tools.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:18.300]   So it can be more creative and interesting, but you know, the idea is that you have to
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.860]   make it broad enough that nobody hates it, you know?
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:27.740]   So you know, Apple can't go around like making a user interface that, you know, 20% of the
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.740]   population hates.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:33.500]   They have to make it innocuous or uninteresting and unusable.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.500]   And I think that's kind of where the touch bar is at, is that the interface and the options
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.700]   for the interface that come with it, come with macOS.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.700]   They're just, they're nothing.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.340]   They're kind of pointless and useless.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:51.180]   But then that's where the developers can come in and like capitalize on that and show
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.740]   off how creative they're.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:59.660]   One of the great things about iOS and Mac OS and iPadOS is it's also a playing field for
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.500]   developers to be creative.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.500]   That's what it's like.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.500]   That's what a good OS is a platform.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:10.060]   I mean, like, you know, and those that they are little, little chinks can be a lot of
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.060]   money.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:16.060]   So, you know, we, when Final Cut up until Final Cut 7, the green screen here was horrible.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.260]   You know, like the green screen here that shipped with Final Cut 7 and we filled that
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:25.060]   niche and, you know, yeah, we made 30, 40,000 dollars a month, you know, on unfilling that
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.940]   niche, you know, you know, so it was a, it was a good niche to fill for a long time.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.900]   You know, and so, so it's, it's, you know, those are great opportunities for developers.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.580]   I think that that's the beauty of it is that developers have those, those little gaps that
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.340]   they can fill and generate some revenue.
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:48.220]   So you'll remember that President Trump went to Austin to the flex plant with Tim Cook,
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.540]   opened the plant that had been open for three years.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:56.140]   And Apple, which a weird flex, Apple announced that they were going to make the Mac Pro in
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.860]   Texas so fast.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.220]   They are making the Mac Pro being sold in the US in Texas.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:07.380]   Now don't tell the president this, but here's a picture from nine to five Mac of a Mac Pro
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:13.060]   purchased in Europe designed by Apple in California, assembled in China.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:17.300]   The original plan was to have the Mac Pro assembled by Quanta in China.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.740]   And apparently that plan for everywhere but the US continues.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.660]   That makes sense.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.940]   It may be cheaper to, well, part of it is tariffs, right?
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.940]   Right.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:31.260]   And what a bullet Apple dodged December 15th, which was Sunday.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.540]   That was when the big tariffs are supposed to kick in the very significant tariffs on
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:41.780]   many of the things that Apple sells and buys and makes anything coming out of China.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:48.300]   And in a eleventh hour settlement, Apple or China and the United States made a trade deal
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.660]   and averted those tariffs.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:56.860]   So I don't know if that's going to affect Quanta's manufacture of the Mac Pro, but that
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.420]   is a big, that is a big deal.
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.740]   It's probably capacity too, like they're ramping up.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.140]   Yeah, there's, well, I don't know.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.740]   I think they're selling that many Mac Pros.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.740]   Maybe they are now.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:09.780]   Oh, yeah, they may be because I think they're, I see a lot of people buying them, which is
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.780]   kind of interesting.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.780]   I think there's a lot of pent up demand.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.780]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.860]   And they had to ramp up too before the whole America, Texas factory thing was settled.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.980]   They probably had to start producing them for the rest of the world and everywhere.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.620]   And in case it didn't work out, they probably had to have that set up as well.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.060]   Laura, I know you listen to the analyst calls.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.580]   Did Apple say anything about tariffs in the last quarter?
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.500]   Do they say, well, here is the problem.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.780]   On December 15th, they would have had to raise the price on the iPhone by $150.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.020]   We already know that they're probably at the max they can charge.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.180]   So that means they would have eaten it.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.220]   That would have cut seriously to profits.
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:46.140]   Yeah, I think the best they mentioned at the time was that there was nothing to worry
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.700]   about that they weren't going to raise the price of products and that they were, you
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.820]   know, had positive hopes for the future.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.620]   They're always vague with it, right?
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.940]   But I think what they were basically getting at was that number one, that they're working
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:04.380]   toward diversifying where products are being made and number two, that until that happens
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.740]   that the consumer is not going to see the negative effect of that.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.780]   The deal was made December 12th.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.660]   The tariffs would have gone into effect that Sunday.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:23.100]   15% import duty or as Bloomberg calls it, important duty on iPhones, iPads and Macbooks.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.140]   15% a significant happy mark looks.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.140]   Study on TV.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.140]   There he is.
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:34.780]   That would have been a significant bump and Apple would probably have had to absorb that.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.540]   I don't think that Apple would be able to raise the prices maybe on the MacBook, but
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.540]   not on the iPhone.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.700]   They've eaten them so far.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:41.940]   I think they would keep eating them.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:48.220]   They're paying duties on the Apple Watch on AirPods, on the iMac, on the HomePod.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.860]   I'm not sure if this New Deal and I don't think Bloomberg News says some of these levies
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:56.900]   may be rolled back if the New Deal gets rid of those tariffs, but they're going to look
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.220]   at reducing existing tariffs on the Chinese products.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.140]   So they were eating a significant amount.
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:10.100]   I have to point out though, did you see a Simco Horace Diddy-U's analysis of the others
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.740]   category, the wearables category?
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.660]   And based on his analysis- The Beliegard one.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.660]   And we should say Oasis is very good.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.260]   I think he's track record on these estimates.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.260]   Forma Nokia.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.260]   Forma Nokia guy.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.020]   He knows what he's talking about and he has done this before.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:29.340]   The world doesn't break these out, but he was able somehow to break out, he believes,
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:35.740]   of the others wearables category, 5.2 billion from last quarter, 5.2 billion on the Apple
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.460]   Watch in revenue, 5.
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:43.340]   But the one that blew me away, $4 billion on the AirPods last quarter.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.420]   It's an OK business.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   Bigger than iPod.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.420]   Bigger than iPod.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:53.740]   6 ever at its peak, $16 billion a year on AirPods.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.740]   And it's growing.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.460]   What was the guy who said, "Oh, Apple, you blew it by and beats.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.220]   Man, what a mistake you made."
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.220]   $3 billion.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.580]   They paid for that less than a quarter.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.580]   She's Louise.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.300]   Well, is that properly a Beats product though?
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.700]   Well, I bet you'd all gets rolled in, right?
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.700]   Don't you think?
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.380]   What makes Beats better, conversely, like the H1 and the new Lab has really fixed the
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.380]   Beats sound.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.700]   Like the Beats sounds so much better now that Apple's got their hands on them.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.700]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.420]   I don't think you buy AirPods because they sound good.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.740]   You buy AirPods because everybody else has that.
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.740]   Oh, you don't buy them because they sound good.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.740]   They don't sound good.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.820]   But they even the pro, but you get the little thing and your magic.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.820]   It's amazing.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.820]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.820]   It's a thing.
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.820]   It's a meme.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.020]   Also, credit where credit's due.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.260]   They just work fantastically.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.660]   And it's not necessarily, it's not all about sound.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:44.140]   It really is about when I, when I, the experience of using them, the fact that you've got this
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:49.060]   case that is both as, you can't possibly, I don't, I don't think make it any smaller.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.900]   And it's very satisfying to open and close.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.420]   The thing, the damn things just work.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:59.540]   The, I mean, every, every day they're at least 18, like truly wireless headphones as a special
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.060]   deal on Amazon.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.500]   But you know that they're just junk.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.900]   They cost 30 or 40 bucks.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:09.380]   They, some of them are 40 or 50 bucks, but you buy them and they kind of work, but not
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.380]   really.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.860]   It's a very, very satisfying product.
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.740]   It really makes me excited about what Apple would, Apple could do if they decided that
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:23.340]   let's basically come up with a list of products, consumer electronics that cost less than,
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.180]   let's say, $300.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.540]   And that we think that we could really move the needle on it.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:33.580]   Because there are people who could really benefit from Apple design who maybe they're
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:40.980]   the people who have to, who want to buy the cheaper of the iPhones, but they do have $169
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.860]   to spend on really good wireless headphones.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:47.260]   And it's going to make their, that part of their day of putting in headphones every morning
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.420]   and every afternoon as they commute to work a little bit better.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.020]   So this is why I think this is, the Apple Watch is a fantastic product that doesn't
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.060]   cost very much, relatively speaking.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.740]   AirPods, again, fantastic product doesn't cost very much.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:03.980]   I would love to see what they could do with other, with other sort of categories by saying,
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:09.140]   we're going to bring Apple design where the, if we are charging 20 or 30% more than a competitive
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.780]   product.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:18.380]   It's going to be $10 to $15 or $30 more as opposed to $400, $500, $200, $300 more.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.820]   And I don't know, I might be missing something, but you know, like for me, when I look at
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.340]   the HomeKit stuff, I just want all the HomeKit stuff to work the way my, you know, the way
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.340]   my Apple stuff works.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.100]   You know, I just want to just open it up and I turn it on, I plug it in and it talks to
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.820]   my phone and then it's there.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.380]   You know, like, and I haven't had that experience so far.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.380]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.740]   And I struggle with it for sure that sometimes it works.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:45.560]   Honestly, I think a lot of it has to do with the Siri capability than it does.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:51.740]   When I open my app, my Home app, most of the time, but not all of the time, everything's
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.620]   connected and I can just touch something.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.500]   But the idea of HomeKit is that you're supposed to like, it's supposed to work with Siri.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.740]   That's the joy of it.
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:03.500]   And that's where it all falls apart from me that I'm calling out to my digital assistant
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.140]   to turn the lights on or, you know, lock a door or something.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:12.460]   And a third of the time it doesn't recognize it, it has an issue, it doesn't connect, it
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.460]   takes a minute.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.100]   And, you know, there's just nothing works that way for me.
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.140]   So yeah, HomeKit has a long way to go for sure.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.700]   I have the opposite problem right now and I was blaming Siri for a lot of it because
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.700]   Siri will say, I can't reach it and the stuff will happen anyway and I get so confused.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:31.700]   But my lights wouldn't work and it's the hue, Brijna, I have to unplug it and plug
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:35.740]   it back in every week or so where nothing keeps responding.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.740]   I don't know, is it get full?
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.700]   It's like those headphones you had to restart.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.100]   I'm just ready for home stuff to be better.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.100]   Right.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.100]   And we're going home.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.100]   Go ahead.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:51.860]   Apple needs to start making their own HomeKit things and then we'll probably start seeing
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:57.620]   some improvement on that because, you know, AirPods work so well because they're made
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.620]   by Apple.
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:02.940]   They're 100% in charge of how well it works.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:06.260]   And so right now Apple doesn't make HomeKit things.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.500]   Apple makes HomeKit and then other people make HomeKit things.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.380]   So if Apple starts making their own, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:20.420]   If Apple started making their own light bulbs and their own, you know, video systems,
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:25.460]   or security systems and stuff, then we would definitely see some improvements on reliability
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.620]   because they would be in charge.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.860]   That's kind of brilliant, Laurie.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:36.820]   I mean, I think that if I think their next Home Run product could be, what if they were
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:42.620]   to create their version of the Ring doorbell only you're not terrified that this is going
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:46.500]   to be hijacked by outside people or that they're going to make deals with local police?
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:53.220]   What if they made like an internal, a camera for a version of the Nest camera where it's
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.700]   not necessarily attached to Google, which is a company that you certainly wouldn't trust
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.700]   as much as Apple.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:02.260]   They have one of their greatest assets really is their amazing track record on privacy and
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:09.220]   security because the only time you ever hear of a security breach or privacy breach is usually
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:15.220]   when you unwind it comes down to on Esther decided to use the exact same password and
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.220]   username pair on everything.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:26.380]   And even again, we've said this before that if I trust Google with a lowercase T to have
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:30.700]   a to have a Nest camera and for where I need it, but if Apple decided to create a camera
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:35.220]   like that, I would I uppercase T trust Apple with that sort of thing.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.220]   And I think that's something that they could sell to every single person who has other Apple
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.940]   hardware inside their offices and homes.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.460]   And I don't know how far it goes.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.220]   I mean, maybe HomeKit is the right answer, but I do feel like there's an integrated like
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:51.620]   integrated lifestyle that a lot of us want to have with a lot of our components that we
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.220]   just don't have right now because nothing's talking to each other.
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:44:00.220]   People to really compete though with Google and Amazon on this front ought to have a home
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.220]   pod with a screen.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.220]   I know you guys are router.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.420]   I would start at the router and go from there.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:13.020]   But the screen to me, for instance, I have a Google Nest doorbell and I have a Google
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.660]   Nest home hub max with the screen.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.860]   When somebody's at my doorbell rings a doorbell, I'm sitting there in the kitchen.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.660]   I see them immediately on the screen.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.180]   I see it identifies them by name and says they're at the door.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.180]   I could talk to them.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.180]   I can hear them.
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.580]   The screen is a really important part of a lot.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.940]   But an iPad docking hub be OK with you or is that too much?
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.500]   No, because then I have to have my eye.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.980]   What I want is I already got the home pod in the kitchen.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.140]   It just needs a screen.
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.060]   I mean, I don't know why they don't have a screen.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.420]   Everybody else is putting screens on their devices.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.500]   And they make them really affordable.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.620]   Google during the holidays.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:52.180]   You can buy the Google home with the screen for about $60, $70.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:58.260]   And if you throw a screen on the home pod, which is this, it kind of makes me sad that
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.220]   they launched it to so much fanfare.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:04.660]   But it's in the holiday picture at the Apple Store.
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:08.900]   It's like it doesn't matter if it's off to the side and another product is covering
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.900]   it up a little bit.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.460]   Apple seems to have not invested as much pride in it.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:16.140]   If they were to find a way to make that for $200 with a screen and basically make it
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.220]   a series screen or whatever you want to call it, that would be amazing.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.740]   If you go to the new Fifth Avenue store, they have an entire room.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.420]   It looks like a lounge for the home pod.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:30.000]   It must be a lonely room, but it's completely built out and it's got posters of the home
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.100]   pod all over it.
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:37.100]   It did not make the home pod did not make Time Magazine's list of the top 10 gadgets
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.100]   for the decade.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.100]   Not this year.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.060]   It did make the...
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:49.740]   So this is for the decade, 2010 to 2019, iPad number one on there and also the Apple Watch
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:55.140]   and also the AirPods, Apple Pods.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.300]   So it would flip the watch in iPad, but that's just me.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:45:59.740]   Watch is more important than the iPad.
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.740]   Yes, I think so.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.740]   I think the iPad is number one.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.740]   I'm not sure I put that in number one.
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.740]   No, it was in the date.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:04.740]   Isn't it?
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:05.740]   I thought it was the date.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.740]   Oh, it's quite a lot of people.
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.740]   Yeah, there's the one in 2011.
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:09.740]   For some reason nothing happened.
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.660]   I think it was the Raspberry Pi, then the Chromecast 2013.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.580]   I forgot the Raspberry Pi on my list and now I really regret it.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:16.580]   I definitely regret it.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.940]   That is empowering technology that has changed the world.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:20.940]   I mean, that's amazing.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.220]   I really wish Apple would build their own version of that on like an 8.
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.220]   You know, Intel did.
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.060]   Remember the Edison and it was Apple Pi?
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.620]   But the thing is, it would just be so great to be able to...
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.060]   For the Mac OS on it or I am with it.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.540]   No, running seriously, call it the Apple 4.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.740]   It because...I'm not even joking.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.220]   One of the things I love about my Raspberry Pi is...
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:46.300]   Which I have now about a dozen of them is that they really do open your mind, whether
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.340]   you're 10 years old or considerably past 10 years old as I am, to the idea that whatever
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.860]   solution I want that involves technology, I can probably build it.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.180]   I don't have to buy something off the shelf except for the Raspberry Pi.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:03.260]   But all I have to do is know some Python, know how to operate a soldering iron and know
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.620]   how to watch a YouTube video that explains how to do something and I can make something.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:12.420]   I think that's very much in keeping with the heritage of the Apple 2 line of computers.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:19.780]   The only difficulty is that you couldn't get Apple to create a desktop operating system
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:25.220]   environment for an Apple 4 type of computer.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:30.580]   And boy, I don't think that Apple is a company that would say, "Here is a version of Linux
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.300]   that we absolutely endorse for you on our card product."
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.100]   I think even in iOS would be fine.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.100]   You know, on it.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:39.100]   I don't think they have such a...
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.660]   It's not going to take that.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.660]   It's too easy to do.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:46.100]   Well, iOS is such a dogmatic thing for them, but this is the jewel in the crown.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.940]   This is their point of pride that if...
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.740]   This is not what Apple wants to make is a hobbyist.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.140]   But it would be wonderful.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.580]   Oh, I agree.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.580]   But this...
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:57.740]   I mean, maybe somebody's done a Hackintosh Raspberry Pi, but I just don't see Apple.
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.740]   Oh, no, there is...
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:47:59.740]   Well, there is.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:04.620]   You can run like classic up to a system 6.2, I think.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.620]   Really?
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.620]   Oh, really?
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:07.620]   No, I have...
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.620]   I can make a little Mac.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.620]   $35 Mac.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:11.620]   Oh, look at you.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:12.620]   I got Mac OS running on this.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.460]   It's a Game Boy.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.260]   And I have like, it's such a trip to run like Mac paint on this.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.900]   That it's like, "Oh my God."
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.900]   On a Game Boy.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:22.900]   Wow.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.580]   By the way, here's a sad story.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:29.700]   Remember that great app that turned your iPhone into an iPod?
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:34.380]   And they even had that haptic feedback and all of that.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.340]   Did you actually get a chance to download a play?
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.340]   No, when Apple killed it.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.340]   I didn't get around to it.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.340]   It was so cute.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:48.580]   Rewound said the app got up to number 19 on the app charts.
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.220]   He said that the designer of it said it was...
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.580]   This is his medium post about it.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:49:03.180]   He said it was specifically designed to avoid any violation of Apple trademarks.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.180]   Look at that.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.540]   It looks just like an iPod.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.580]   Wouldn't you make a zoom version out of Vengeance now?
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.380]   Yeah, do a zoom version, Rewound.
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.380]   No, that's funny.
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.380]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.380]   Apple, look at it.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.900]   It's doing so well on the charts.
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:23.660]   734,000 percent increase in sales.
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.180]   So there was even an explosion of skins for it.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.180]   So you can make it...
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.180]   Wow.
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:30.340]   And that was how they're getting around it.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:35.100]   They say, "Well, no, it just happens to have a bare space underneath it."
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:39.100]   And we of course would never provide something that makes it look exactly like a classic
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.300]   iPod, but we will allow you to install your own.
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:47.460]   And I really think that they tried as hard as they as humanly possible to say, "Apple,
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:51.740]   it is now up to you to either be a jerk about this."
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:56.620]   And decide that this is the platform of no fun or to simply say, "You know what?
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:03.500]   We're going to just pretend that we're going to say that on the yay or nay thing on this.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   It could have gone either way.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.660]   We're just going to put our thumb on the scale and say that we're not going to worry
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:08.660]   about this."
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.540]   Oh, no, people are enjoying this.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.260]   We can't have that happen.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.260]   Rewound rights.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:21.300]   Apple have carte blanche over the app store and they got salty.
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:27.460]   So you can also not charge for Apple Music features, but they had already approved the
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.260]   in-app purchase.
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.700]   They were worried that people would mistake it for an Apple product at which point he
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:40.580]   shows his horrible buttons and says, "Not going to happen."
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:47.060]   So they can't update the app to get it re-approved without breaking the app for existing users.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:53.380]   So they're going to upload a separate version to comply with Apple's changes.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:55.980]   And you can go to the re-wound app.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.260]   I'm not sure what they say.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.860]   It's going to live under the re...
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:50:59.860]   So you'll have to...
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:00.860]   I get it.
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:05.460]   So it's crowd fun and you'll have to go there.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:11.260]   If they decide to make an Android version of that, I am totally buying it on the Play Store.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:16.420]   Let's see if Apple can yell at Google and say, "Hey, they probably can."
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:21.340]   I mean, Apple and Nintendo, there's some companies that it's never worth the effort.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.220]   You get so much heart and soul.
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.500]   We love them so much.
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:25.500]   We want to be part of them.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.180]   We have huge nostalgia for them.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.620]   But there's just some companies I would never go anywhere.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.180]   Other companies are really cool about that.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:36.180]   They think about those remixes as rewinds, as helping spread their brand and their love.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.500]   And does there are some companies who are not that?
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.500]   So I love...
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.940]   Actually, this is a better workaround.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.820]   So they're doing a crowd funding.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:50.180]   And you can go to rewound.fund to support it to write a PWA, a progressive web app, at
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:54.140]   rewound.app, which will work on the iPhone, but won't have to go through the store so
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:57.300]   Apple won't be able to stop it.
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.300]   That ultimately...
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.660]   And this is why I think Apple's support of PWA has been so lukewarm.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:04.700]   This is the way you get around the store.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:11.180]   If Apple is smart, they will support it because then that eliminates all of the lawsuits and
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.460]   the pressure they're getting about their monopoly with the app store.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.460]   They can always say...
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:16.460]   All they support...
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:21.420]   Their official policy was that if your Playboy make a web app, that's like the open app store.
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.060]   That's what lets them get out of trouble quite often in terms of the control they have over
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.060]   the app store.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:31.380]   I think the PWA thing was just that was a technological load that was a load too far
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.380]   for them.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.380]   They've come around to that.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.860]   But I think anything that helps them have that second ecosystem is helping for them
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.020]   so many political and internal levels.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.020]   So do it.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.940]   I mean, they have service workers in Safari.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:44.940]   They're starting to support.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.740]   It's not as well supported as maybe on other platforms, but it's pretty good.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:54.940]   The rewound web app and Android app, Andy, you'll be happy to hear, is on GoFundMe.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.740]   And so far they've only raised 121 euros, but that's probably because...
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.300]   I will go fund that.
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.300]   Go fund it.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.820]   This is one of those statements that I think anybody has to preface with.
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.340]   I'm not joking here.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:13.140]   But when you think about it, we're now at a stage where the iPod is...
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.980]   Excuse me, we're soon going to be at the stage where the iPod is 20 years old, which
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.060]   means that you're at a point where people who were teenagers and in college, when they
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:27.860]   got their first iPod, are going to start feeling nostalgic for this device that was a central
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.300]   part of their lives every single day.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:35.260]   Just like I find myself getting nostalgic for a cassette, a disc man and a cassette
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:36.260]   walkman.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:41.660]   Not enough to spend $500 for one that works, but still I kind of get that feeling of, "Oh,
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.660]   wouldn't it be cool to be pressing buttons?
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.180]   I wouldn't be cool to make mixtapes again?"
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.660]   And I'm not suggesting this is a large part of the market, but this is going to become
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:57.780]   an ongoing urge to the Apple community that I kind of want to re-connect with the technology
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:02.140]   that Apple created, the software that Apple created, that can put me back into those great
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:08.180]   feelings of when I was in school and use HyperCard for the first time.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:13.380]   And that's the sort of thing that I get into with Emulator is that I'm not trying to lose
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:17.900]   myself in the past, but it is really, really fun to revisit Mac Draw, particularly after
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:18.900]   you're...
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.180]   I was a super, super, super fan of it.
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:22.180]   I loved it.
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:27.060]   It was like my main means of artistic expression back in the day, and to get a chance to play
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:29.740]   with that again is a really, really big deal.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.740]   So I'm not saying that this is a market that Apple needs to cater to or even necessarily
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:38.240]   would want to cater to, but I think that they're going to find a lot more pressure coming
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:46.580]   from people as they enter their 30s and 40s and 50s to want to revisit Mac OS 10.0.
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:50.140]   They want to revisit what a color classic was like.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:53.980]   They want to revisit what an iPod was like.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:59.260]   So this might be an ongoing thing.
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:03.620]   They might have to at least loosen their grips on a little bit just for the good of the land.
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.220]   I neglected to mention the bottom line on IFix.
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.380]   If I fix it, it's teared out of the Mac Pro.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:16.940]   A maximum, I think, repairability score, you can see the needles pegged of nine.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:17.940]   It's hovering.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:18.940]   It's wavering.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:22.140]   The only reason it's not 10 is the SSD cards are modular.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:26.820]   You're probably using the T2 chips so you can't get your own SSD in there.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:29.820]   But you could put your own, yeah, you could because it doesn't have sat.
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:31.060]   I'm sure it has sata, right?
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.660]   So you could put an Intel or a Samsung SSD.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:37.100]   There are a bunch of days that you can fill up days.
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.100]   You can fill the days.
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:41.660]   That's probably the first time I fix it has given Apple a score.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.660]   Anything above three ever.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:44.660]   I know.
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.660]   It's amazing.
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:49.580]   It's the first time the heat gun at that lab stayed cold for the entire tear down.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:52.660]   Must have been like drinking and partying.
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:53.900]   And this is a really important one.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.820]   This might be something a little new about Apple.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:00.540]   Apple provides some step numbers and diagrams for disassembly right on the device.
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:05.420]   They're on the device and publishes free repair manuals for some repairs.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:06.420]   So that's great.
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:16.940]   You can't just put the cheese on top of the bagel and serve it.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.420]   You kind of want to give that extra little bit of char on the top.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:20.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.420]   No, what is that?
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.540]   They shave at New Year's on Switzerland.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:24.540]   That's what you need to use.
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.900]   That nice soft cheese.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.940]   Let's take a little break and then some good news for Alex's hometown.
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:36.300]   But first, not standing news, but first a word from Taylor Store.
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.980]   I would say I'm wearing a Taylor Store shirt, but I'm not.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.940]   It's actually kind of an ill fitting shirt.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.820]   This is the last time I buy shirts off the rack.
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:48.900]   All my shirts from now on custom made by Taylor Store.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.260]   They don't cost anymore and they do an amazing thing.
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:55.580]   You don't actually have to go to Hong Kong or get a tailor to come to you and measure
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.580]   you.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.340]   Taylor Store has an app called Size Me.
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.340]   It's on the iPhone.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.340]   It's on Android.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:04.580]   You put your phone on the ground and you take pictures of yourself.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:10.820]   Just a couple and they will get your sizes from that using statistics and AI to generate
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:11.820]   your sizes.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:17.940]   Now once they're in at Taylor Store.com, you can choose from a selection of pre-designed
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:23.700]   dress shirts all with your unique fit or, and I love this, if you want to take some time,
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:28.380]   if you're a customizer, you can customize with their design tool and it's amazing.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:33.180]   You can change everything, the sleeves, the collars, the cuffs, pocket or no pocket, back
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.540]   details, bottom cut.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.860]   You want tails, you want a square cut, buttons.
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:40.020]   You can even change the button thread.
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.420]   So you can contrast thread.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:45.380]   So much more, I love my Taylor Store shirts.
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:52.820]   They have a big variety of very nice fabrics, some really, I'm a kind of a fabric snob when
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:56.300]   it comes to my shirts and they have the best fabrics I've ever seen.
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:57.300]   They're adding features all the time.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:01.820]   They newest feature a hidden button down on your shirt collar and a collar curve which
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:05.060]   adapts to the curve of your shoulders.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.260]   They guarantee it will fit by the way.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:12.300]   If you go through the process with Size Me and then get a shirt and it comes and it's
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.260]   a little off, no problem.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:18.300]   You take a picture of the fit, show them where it's missing, send it to them.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.300]   They'll send you another.
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.540]   You don't have to return the old shirt.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:22.780]   You can give it to Goodwill or keep it if you want.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.420]   All you need is two pictures and they will make the necessary adjustments and send you
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.420]   your new shirt properly at no cost.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:32.060]   It's a Swedish company and I have to say they're doing it right.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.580]   It's not sweatshop labor.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:37.340]   The shirts are made in their custom factories in Sri Lanka.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.860]   In fact, if you order a shirt from Taylor Store, you can have them send you pictures of the
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.540]   shirt being made.
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.540]   It's carbon neutral.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:47.140]   They buy carbon credits for everything.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.020]   The gas used to drive the car to work in the morning.
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:53.260]   They have a carbon credit for.
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:56.380]   They're using amazing, beautiful fabrics.
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:03.740]   These seamstresses in Sri Lanka and I'm sure seamsters, the sewing folk do such a nice
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.740]   job.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:08.100]   It's beautifully made, every stitch in place.
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:14.620]   Whenever you want to look your best and close it, fit perfectly for your body, go to Taylor
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.860]   Store.com/twit.
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.060]   I always wanted custom shirts.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.060]   Never thought I could afford them.
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:23.660]   You can right now when you use a coat, you'll get 50% off your first dress shirt as little
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.900]   as $39.
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.660]   Also free shipping, by the way.
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.980]   I love my shirts from Taylor Store.
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.180]   That's all I buy now.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:34.260]   Taylor Store.com/twit, use the offer code to it.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:38.860]   It's the unrivaled fit and comfort of Taylor Store's handpicked fabrics for yourself.
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:39.940]   Terms and conditions apply.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:44.500]   Go to TaylorStore.com/twit and don't forget the offer code "twit".
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:48.140]   It's "twit", but they'll know you saw it on Mac break weekly and they'll give us credit.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:50.660]   "Twit" is the offer code.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.900]   Thank you, Taylor Store.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:52.900]   It's really fun.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.900]   It's a really great process.
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:57.380]   Once you get the size in there and you just order, I go back all the time.
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.380]   I should have worn my flamingo shirt.
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.020]   The best shirt.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:02.980]   I wore it all through the cruise.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.820]   Do you know this building in Pittsburgh?
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.300]   The Athletic Association Building, Alex?
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.660]   I do know where that building is.
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:12.380]   90,000 square foot space.
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.300]   Apple is eyeing it.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:18.540]   It's undergoing a $25 million renovation.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.660]   Most pointedly, it is about...
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:24.260]   If I remember correctly, it's two or three blocks from Carnegie Mellon.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.780]   Oh, that's why.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.180]   Yeah, because why would Apple be in Pittsburgh?
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:32.180]   I think that the iWork team is there.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.180]   Is downtown.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.460]   I've never been there by the Nirmatum, but I've heard that they're...
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.180]   It's near University of Pittsburgh and CMU.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:44.660]   So, Pitt and Carnegie Mellon are right next to each other and this is right between the
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.660]   two.
[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:49.980]   But I think that of Pitt and Carnegie Mellon, the one that is the primary target is Carnegie
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.980]   Mellon.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.980]   There's one other connection.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:55.140]   They get their stainless steel for the Mac Pro from...
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.140]   U.S.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.140]   Allegheny Technologies.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.140]   Oh, Alcoa.
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.140]   Is that Alcoa?
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.140]   Allegheny Technologies?
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.140]   Oh, Allegheny Technologies?
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.140]   I don't know.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.700]   It might be a part of Alcoa.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.700]   But Alcoa is there.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.100]   I don't know for sure.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.100]   But I think that the...
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:12.700]   Yeah, it's positioned with Carnegie Mellon is probably the primary reason to put it right
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:13.700]   where they're putting it.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.700]   And it's a lot of space that's open to...
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.700]   That's in Pittsburgh.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.700]   But for them being near the universities is where you're not...
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.700]   That's a big part of it.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.500]   I mean, for all of these companies...
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.380]   And Google has a huge presence, not in very far away.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.380]   So in Liberty...
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.140]   Yeah, you want to be near the engineers.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:32.740]   In East Liberty, which is about 10 minutes from there, there's a huge Google presence
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.980]   that keeps on getting bigger.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:38.500]   And again, a lot of it has to do with getting ahold of the university students early because
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.500]   it's...
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.660]   For getting capacity for these companies is everything.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:48.460]   You wouldn't think you could make the camera and the iPhone any better.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.620]   Despite what Marquez Brownley says.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:51.620]   Ew.
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.620]   The iPhone was really...
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.820]   I lost so much money betting on the Royale Flex Pie.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:02:03.220]   I was so sure after the Pogo phone almost took it last year that I could really flex that
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.220]   pie.
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.500]   You've got to really wonder...
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.020]   I guess you can't crowdsource this kind of stuff.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.260]   Oh, he explained it brilliantly.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.940]   He said like every time the bright photo would win because people would pick the...
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.940]   And when they couldn't pick the bright photo, like when they were equally bright, they would
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:21.620]   pick the one that had no depth of field because obviously a better camera has a better focus.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.620]   Right.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.620]   It's all in focus.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:24.900]   Marquez does this every year.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:29.940]   He does a blind shootout where he takes pictures with a bunch of phones and does a bracket.
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.700]   iPhone was eliminated almost immediately.
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.500]   Which just tells you how good this is.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.940]   And I think was the winner of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10?
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:38.940]   Was that the winner?
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   I can't remember what the winner was.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.300]   Yeah, it was the Galaxy Note 10 and the Galaxy 10e were both at the end bracket and he took
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.980]   exactly the same photo.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:49.860]   But because the 10e was magenta and he shot it through a window, it had a slight magenta
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.260]   haze due to the reflection of the casing on it.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:57.580]   And people could see that so they obviously picked the way better identical cameras.
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:03.460]   So it's a good thing to do in theory, but in practice it turns out.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:06.940]   And this is by the way why Samsung does what it does with its photos.
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:11.380]   It pops the color, it over sharpens I think.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:15.940]   If you look, if you pixel peep at Samsung pictures, they're not very realistic.
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.420]   They crush stuff.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:21.700]   But doesn't it remind you of how Instagram used to correct for bad cameras with filters?
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:25.980]   And now the cameras are good and the cameras have to try to correct for the lack of resolution
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.380]   in Instagram and Twitter.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:31.300]   But the only thing that I would have liked is the iPhone really did a bad job on that
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300]   photo.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.260]   He said it took it over and over again and it just kept the white balance kept being blue.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.820]   But I would have liked to have seen a couple of first rounds of different kinds so that
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:43.820]   if a camera did have a misfire or if it's better on landscapes than it is on people,
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.420]   that would have been the first round of elimination and maybe like a wrestling tournament.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:51.380]   You have the first round is round robin and then you go to the elimination for the
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.380]   final.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.380]   I was surprised.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:57.060]   I mean, all the bet, what I consider the best camera phones to pixel for the iPhone
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:03.860]   11, the OnePlus all of the Huawei, none of them made it.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:06.700]   So it's like, well, okay, fine.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.580]   It's hard to tell somebody.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.100]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.900]   It's hard to tell somebody you're wrong for liking the picture that you like.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:20.700]   And so that's why I think that when I as late as five years ago, when I was when I would
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:24.820]   be reviewing a phone, there would be a really, really important point to my even if I'm
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:29.700]   just testing one iPhone to bring five different phones with me and take the same shot over
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.780]   and over again, just as compare.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.180]   How's how's the dealing with the shadows?
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:36.540]   I was dealing with that big big highlights from the sky.
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:42.940]   At this point, I got the most the most angry I ever got with people followers on Twitter.
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:46.300]   I mean, like a parent just being disappointed in their children.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.580]   I know that sounds horrible.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:52.620]   But is when I was just posting a couple of pictures like unedited from like from the iPhone
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:58.220]   and from the pixel for and it was nothing but oh God, well, isn't it horrible that Google
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:01.180]   doesn't care about about fidelity that way.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.980]   And exactly the same people say different people say the exact same thing about Apple
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:09.860]   where it's like, look, this is not a this is not a an emphatic side by side comparison.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:15.460]   You're looking at one picture that's been beaten up by Twitter, but Twitter is a processor
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.460]   on it.
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:18.340]   I thought this one picture is not going to tell you anything.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.660]   I'm just thought that you maybe you would be curious to see two very, very sensible
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.820]   but differing approaches approaches to the same scene.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:30.260]   So nowadays I'm trying to figure out what the best compromise is.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:35.020]   And I'm thinking that maybe I should start with say when I post real pictures saying
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:40.020]   I want you to here's here's here's here's here's my explanation of what I think about
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.020]   these cameras.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.700]   I think that my new test is going to have to be I'm going to set a two minute shot clock
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:52.020]   within whatever the default photo editor is on on this phone where I can take the picture
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:55.340]   that this took and saying just like anybody else would saying, gee, I wish that were a
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.340]   little bit brighter.
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.100]   Gee, I wish the calls were a little bit better.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:04.540]   And then maybe then it would be more of a fair comparison because at this point, any
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:09.140]   good camera any good phone takes good enough pictures across the board that it comes down
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:12.100]   to do you prefer lighter pictures over dark pictures?
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:16.420]   Do you prefer quote over sharpening over softer details?
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:21.660]   And so this way again pixel peeping is just so so crushing for anybody who wants to help
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:28.020]   somebody decide which which which is the better phone for them.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:32.540]   So the iPhone is going to get better though because Apple just bought a UK startup called
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:39.620]   Spectral Edge designed to improve colors in smartphone photos.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.260]   I don't know anything about.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.860]   I thought you were going to say it was going to get a Marquesmo now saying, please.
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:49.900]   Every vendor, please do not go and use the brightness and introduce them.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.900]   One of the things that's interesting about the technology that they're using, at least
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:59.260]   from what I've read about them is that they're using infrared data to sharpen the image.
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.340]   So which does actually kind of make sense.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:08.060]   So the red profile is the one where contrast lives, right?
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.420]   It's mostly in the red.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.420]   Infrared?
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:11.420]   No, just red.
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:12.420]   Well, there is an infrared.
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:17.540]   I know when I'm bumping contrast in Photoshop using levels, if I work in the red channel
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.540]   it seemed to get a...
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.740]   Well, they're actually taking infrared.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.740]   So they're taking an infrared image.
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:24.940]   It's just even more red, isn't it?
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:25.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:26.940]   Isn't infrared just super red?
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:27.940]   So it's a visceral.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:28.940]   That's a visceral, I know.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.780]   What it allows it to do and you'll actually see a little bit of this in if you look at
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:38.540]   the behind the scenes for the Irishman, the witness cameras on either side of the main
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:41.380]   camera are infrared.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:42.380]   And so...
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.060]   Those are the ones that are making the 3D models of the faces with.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.220]   They're not making the 3D models, they're tracking them.
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.220]   Tracking them.
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.220]   So they can make 3D models.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.460]   Right, because what happens is they're not sensitive to light because it's just the heat
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.460]   off of...
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.460]   Right.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.460]   It's a...
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.460]   So what it means is you're not...
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:58.500]   It doesn't matter whether it's lit or unlit, it's still going to grab that information.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:04.180]   So it's a really interesting way to go and grab detail and be able to use that as part
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.740]   of the detail calculation in the luminance.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.340]   So the way that you're...
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:14.100]   All of our detail, what we think of as sharp is all generally living inside of the luminosity.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:16.740]   So the black and white information of the image.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:20.140]   And then you just swash color over top of that, you paint color over it.
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:27.020]   And so using the infrared to help identify where those edges are and to pull those out
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.820]   means that it's not being connected to...
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:30.820]   And it's a very...
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.580]   It's just more information.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.540]   It's information you don't normally capture, right?
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.540]   It is.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:40.380]   The red information is not connected to whether it's bright or dark and it is theoretically
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.380]   good for a lot of it.
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.220]   It would be great for low light.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.700]   I mean, it would be great for bringing out the detail.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.700]   You see that petteter view?
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.700]   What?
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:47.700]   What you're getting at?
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.700]   Is the petteter view from the movie where you...
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.300]   You didn't fail and then it's all like in different colors?
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.300]   It's what a cat sees.
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.300]   So...
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:56.300]   No, that's...
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.740]   Oh, so it's just another area of the spectrum that is not normally captured by the camera.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.060]   It'll get a sense of what it would look like if you...
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:05.300]   They need sensors to do this where they have a special infrared...
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:06.300]   You'd have to have...
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.900]   Well, the information's hitting the sensor.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.900]   It's a question of how the sensor...
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.900]   It's not important.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.900]   Yeah, because a lot of times we have coatings on the sensors to keep us from dealing with
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.900]   that data, right?
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:20.460]   I mean, usually when you want them to have an infrared camera, you send it in and someone
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.460]   should have sent it.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.460]   You take the bare filter off, don't you?
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.460]   Or something like that?
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.460]   They strip off the UV...
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.460]   You do filter.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.140]   The UV is for the UV, but the infrared...
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.580]   Either way, they have to change the way it's filtered.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:30.580]   Interesting.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:31.580]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:32.580]   Yeah, 'cause it's not...
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.580]   It's a minor...
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.260]   Not a minor, but it's an inexpensive modification to take an existing...
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.500]   DSLR and turn it into an infrared camera.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.140]   I remember I almost did that all night.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.140]   Or an old...
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.140]   The 70.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:42.140]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.140]   Interesting.
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.140]   I'm thinking of taking one of my cameras and something like that.
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.140]   You get great...
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.140]   It's a great look.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.540]   If you take pictures of green, it turns white, right?
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:52.500]   And so I had a friend who was a National Geographic photographer, did that to one of
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:58.940]   his cameras and took a picture at Arlington National Cemetery that was stark.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:09:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:00.940]   It was gorgeous.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.260]   Yeah, it's really beautiful.
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:06.700]   So this is something we'll be looking for in maybe next year or the year after...
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.700]   2024.
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.700]   2024.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.700]   I'm just guessing I was like...
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.700]   Well, maybe they just hired this.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.700]   It's gonna take years.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.940]   It's gonna take years for it to get into the show up somewhere.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.780]   Let's see.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.500]   iOS 13.3 bug in communication limits.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:26.300]   This is part of the new parental control feature.
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:32.060]   It was supposed to let you limit who your kid talks to, but apparently kids can get around
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.060]   it.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:34.060]   Kids got around it?
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.060]   Kids got around it.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.060]   What a shock.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:40.180]   CNBC says it doesn't work properly.
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:45.900]   There are several bugs, but it lets your kids talk to shocking strangers on the phone
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.620]   FaceTime or through text messages.
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.340]   So I'm sure Apple will fix that.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:53.220]   Look for 13.3.1 any day now.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.380]   Did it just hit beta?
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.380]   Did it just hit beta?
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:57.380]   All right.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.380]   Today, yeah.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.020]   I'm an Apple Arcade fan.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.940]   I think it's worth five bucks a month.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:08.060]   It's $60 a year, but Apple has apparently added a new annual $50 subscription, so you
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.060]   can even save more if you buy a year.
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:11.060]   What would you pay now?
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.060]   Huh?
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.060]   What would you pay now?
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.060]   How much would you pay?
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.060]   There's more.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.060]   There's more.
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.060]   My kids love Apple Arcade.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:21.300]   Sorry, in Canada, it'll be $59.99 a year.
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.300]   It's the headwinds.
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.300]   It's the headwinds.
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.300]   It's the headwinds, Lee.
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.300]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:28.300]   49.99 pounds, 49.99 euro.
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.740]   I think we're getting the best deal out of that, right?
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.820]   Yeah, it's like, yeah, we are.
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:37.420]   Two free months of Apple Arcade for 50 bucks.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:41.620]   And think about the fact that that's about the cost of one console game.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:45.860]   And yes, I realize that console games are much more complicated, but it's, you know...
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.860]   You get 100 games.
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:47.860]   There's so many games.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:54.740]   Have you played the new one, Apple's pushing like crazy, the celebrity soccer, which is
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:58.140]   weird because the celebrities are sports people from other sports.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.060]   I don't get it.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.060]   Can you tackle in golf?
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:02.940]   I will pay them that 50 bucks right now.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:06.380]   It's called Ultimate Rivals.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:16.940]   License starts from the NHL NBA NFL, MLB, WNBA, and the US Women's National Soccer Team.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:21.700]   And I don't know what sport they're playing, but...
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:26.700]   I went to Hour of Code and they had Snowman, the people who make Altos Adventure and the
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.700]   card game.
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.060]   Oh, I love Altos Adventure, yeah.
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:34.700]   They were so happy with Apple Arcade, just letting them make these kinds of games.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.460]   Really, they're happy about it.
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.980]   Yeah, it was like the card game was like 10 years in development.
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:43.300]   It was a young programmer who had the idea in school and worked on it, worked on their
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.460]   friends, eventually teamed up with Snowman to put it out.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:49.140]   And it was unclear, I think, what kind of market it would have.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:52.020]   But with an Apple Arcade, it's just been phenomenal.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:57.340]   You know, given the licensing costs of getting Justin Turner and Wayne Gretzky...
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.340]   Well, maybe Gretzky's cheap.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.340]   These days he's retired.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.340]   Alex Morgan.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:06.700]   He's a greatest of all time.
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.060]   But the licensing costs must be prohibitive.
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.500]   So that shows there's some money to be made in Apple Arcade.
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.260]   When you're always looking at it, especially if you're doing some kind of niche that is
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.380]   in a first-person shooter or a big game, that type of thing.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.300]   This is where the arcade is perfect.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.300]   You just can't...
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.980]   For game companies, it's really hard to take the risk of the investment to go down that
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.100]   path when you don't know how it's going to turn out.
[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.180]   And then, of course, you come out with one game that does really well.
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:32.620]   I mean, you look at an example of my favorite game that...
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.620]   Of Field Runners.
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.580]   You know, they just weren't able to maintain it.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:36.580]   Right.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.060]   You know, it's not a continued income.
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.060]   Right.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.500]   But as a game that you would just have on as part of your Apple Arcade, it would be great.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.500]   They're not playing...
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.780]   Soccer, I'm sorry, they're playing the ice hockey.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:47.220]   So you'll like that, Renee.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.220]   Yes.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.220]   Yes.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.420]   I'm a fan of the ice hockey.
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.420]   And it'll be followed by a basketball game.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:53.420]   So this is the rink.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:54.420]   Ultimate rivals.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.420]   The rink.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:56.420]   And in the spring, Ultimate rivals.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.420]   Court.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:59.700]   It's the Pogo Funga to win this too.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.700]   I'll be so sad.
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:07.780]   I just want to poke our game or any sort of a gambling game where you get to go against
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:13.260]   like Michael Jordan or any of these other sports frees who are terrible, terrible at gambling.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.260]   Apple News.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:16.260]   What?
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.260]   You know, what does it matter?
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:18.260]   Let me win for one's.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.260]   Just let me win.
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.260]   What does it matter?
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.260]   You know, you got plenty of money, Michael.
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:22.260]   Just let me win.
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:23.380]   You get each player you're playing against.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.740]   You have the card shark.
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:27.740]   You have the whale.
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:30.140]   You have the-- you're going to put them in there so they're all-- you're playing different
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.860]   people and you have to-- there's like a randomization.
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:36.420]   Oh, because also, players are really hard to play because you can't figure out what
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.420]   they're going to do next.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.420]   That's true.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:39.420]   That's true.
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:40.420]   I can't-- I have our time.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.100]   I just want-- I don't know if Michael Jordan has a gambling addiction.
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:45.100]   I hope he does not.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.100]   I don't mean to offend that way.
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:51.340]   But I want to play against people who have more money than God and don't care.
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:55.340]   Our way-- our way are not nearly as good as they think they are and don't care if they
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:58.140]   lose like $120,000 on one hand.
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.140]   No big.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.940]   And I'm willing to extend me the level of credit where I can--
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:02.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:03.940]   --he can keep that--
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:06.940]   --live coverage coming to Apple News.
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:12.500]   They've done a deal with ABC News to provide live video coverage of the 2020 presidential
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:17.020]   election and future primary and general debates.
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.020]   I think it's a horrible idea.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.140]   I think they should just stay away from this election as far as they possibly.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:26.540]   Well, there will be-- it's blocking, blocking, blocking.
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:27.540]   All right.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.540]   All right.
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:31.260]   Rafe doesn't want me to go to that site.
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.540]   But this is--
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:33.540]   He's radioactive.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.540]   It's radioactive.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:39.180]   And there's just-- there's so many-- so people are so upset about everything on both
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:40.180]   sides that it's just like--
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.180]   Just don't put it in Apple News.
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.180]   It's just too divisive.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:44.180]   And you think you just stay out of this moment.
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:46.940]   Well, if you're going to do news, you've got to do news.
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.940]   You can't not cover the presidential election.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:49.940]   You keep on covering it.
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.940]   You just keep on putting up the articles that you have there.
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:52.940]   You don't have to put video in there.
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.020]   You're going to stick out and do something first.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.020]   This is not the place to go.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:01.140]   I think it's an interesting point, though, because they had-- to this point, they don't
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.700]   have any video in news, right?
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:04.660]   This is-- it's just text.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:08.260]   I mean, there might be embedded videos in an article.
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:11.900]   But this is-- this is, I guess, like articles, except it won't be articles that will be
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:12.900]   ABC News.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:16.820]   Wouldn't you start with a softer market like the New Zealand elections or the Canadian
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:19.780]   election and then work your way up?
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:24.860]   Apple did not describe it still with ABC's exclusive and declined to comment on whether
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.220]   it's going to get other news organizations involved.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:32.020]   So this may be the beginning of-- I mean, the good news is, I mean, I'm sure that I've
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:36.420]   picked ABC because they're probably closest to the center that you find.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.660]   Also Disney people.
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:38.660]   You know what?
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.700]   The hottest category in podcasts right now is political news podcasts.
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.940]   That's a very hot category.
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:43.940]   I don't--
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:44.940]   You may be--
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:46.420]   You may be tired of it.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.420]   I don't even see it.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.420]   You know, I'm not tired of it.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:52.060]   I have a filter in Twitter that eliminates it.
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.060]   I wonder why I don't--
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:54.060]   I wonder why I don't believe--
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:55.060]   It was saying the same thing.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.060]   He blucks anything with it in Peach.
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:57.540]   He just doesn't want to hear it.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.980]   I have 50, 60 terms that if you put those in your thing-- it's funny because I'll see
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:05.420]   replies to things and it'll say, this blocked, this blocked, this blocked.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.940]   But normally in my feed, I don't see any of it, which makes Twitter a lot more fun.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.940]   Maybe you've seen this too, Leo.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:11.940]   I don't know.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.820]   But it used to be like we had a lot of people who just sit on technology news and technology
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:18.660]   blogs and technology everything all day and a huge part of that audience is now splitting
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:21.220]   attention with politics, which never used to be the case.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:25.140]   Like the Blackberry forms would be busing and now we've lost a whole ton of attention
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.140]   to politics.
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.140]   No.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.740]   That's going to end maybe sooner than later.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.740]   But at some point--
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:32.740]   Come back.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:33.740]   We want you.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:34.740]   And you know what?
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:39.980]   It's actually a testament to Donald Trump's real skill at media, right?
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:42.820]   He-- for whatever else you might say about him--
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:46.820]   He's very good at getting people to pay attention.
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:49.740]   There's-- I can tell you that broadcasters are--
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:53.260]   Broadcasters are already worried financially about--
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:54.260]   Somebody else gets elected.
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.260]   You're not going to get--
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:18:00.460]   No, they are literally worried financially about what happens in 2021 because they're
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:01.460]   making so much money--
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.460]   Trump is so good for this.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:06.380]   And they've built up so much of an infrastructure just to support covering him.
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:08.380]   I mean, you know, that they're worried about--
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:12.140]   It's the same thing for the Daily on the New York Times Daily, NPR's first stuff.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.740]   All of these shows benefit because Trump is president.
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:16.740]   Frankly, that's what happened during the election.
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:17.740]   Because he tweets.
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.740]   Right.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.940]   I've even gone to studios and been all miked up and ready to go and they go, "Sorry, the
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:22.940]   president tweeted."
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:23.940]   The president tweeted.
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:24.940]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:25.940]   Like over and over again.
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:28.100]   He is really good at that.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:33.220]   Now, at Thanksgiving, I wanted to buy Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.620]   And it was like $20.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:36.700]   It was expensive.
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:37.700]   Good news.
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.740]   It actually was $10.
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:40.740]   Charlie Brown--
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:41.740]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:42.740]   $20.
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:45.060]   Charlie Brown Christmas $10.
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.220]   Apple's having a sale.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.980]   How the Grinch stole Christmas $10.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.820]   A very muppet Christmas $10.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.780]   Christmas with the crank $8.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:54.300]   I don't know if the price tells you something.
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.140]   The night before $8.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:57.780]   Arthur Christmas $8.
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.780]   Big sale.
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:01.180]   Santa Hoo down to $10.
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.180]   Okay.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:06.740]   There are other good deals on other movies.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:10.700]   But that's the big one.
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:11.700]   You need that special.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:12.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:13.700]   You just need it.
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.180]   Do I need Charlie Brown Christmas?
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.180]   Should I own it?
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:17.180]   You need it.
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.180]   You do.
[01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.180]   Get it.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.180]   It's worth it.
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.180]   It's a great pumpkin Charlie Browner is at a different one.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.660]   The great pumpkin Charlie Brown is the one that comes out at Halloween.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.660]   And then there's Thanksgiving.
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:29.340]   It's Thanksgiving Charlie Brown.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.260]   You could spend $60 getting all three.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:38.220]   Well, you don't have to get the ones from years and years and years and later.
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.220]   When there is an Arbor Day special, there is a--
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.220]   Is there really?
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.140]   It's your first kiss, Charlie Brown.
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:51.100]   But I'm saying that for the Christmas special, and then Thanksgiving special too, you want
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:58.380]   to have it standing by for when you suddenly have this over-encompassing ache to watch the
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.380]   Charlie Brown Christmas special.
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:03.700]   It's going to happen sometime in December, just like at some point you're going to want
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:09.740]   to see Santa Claus, Carters the Martians episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.460]   But you never know what's going to hit you.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.100]   You want to have it standing by for that.
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.580]   You don't have to order something.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.380]   You don't even have to want to have to go through a purchase sort of thing.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:22.980]   You just want to pick up the remote and say, "Charles Charles, Bill Melendez, please cure
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:23.980]   this ache in my heart."
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.620]   I just want the piano.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.100]   Bill Melendez, here's a little bit.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:28.100]   Yes.
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:29.100]   Just to make you feel good.
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:36.100]   I'm going to turn my sound.
[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:39.100]   Who's my sound on?
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:42.100]   We're not going to play that.
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.100]   Oh, sorry.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.100]   Maybe Laura could do a punk version for us.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.100]   Am I going to get us in trouble?
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:52.100]   If they will get taken down, please sing it.
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.100]   We will not get taken down.
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:54.100]   Okay.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.100]   I just want to play the trailer from Apple's own site.
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.100]   We're the Charlie Broad Prince.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:04.100]   This is the chilling effect that this illegal copyright restrictions perpetrated by YouTube
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.020]   and Apple, they're illegal.
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:07.020]   That's fair use.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:08.380]   We're talking about it as a news thing.
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:11.860]   And the chilling effect is we can't even show it, which is ridiculous.
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.300]   There was a brilliant video, Leo.
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:18.380]   What this guy did was he made his own terrible outro for every one of his videos, and he
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:21.500]   put it at the end of it, and then he signed up for CD Baby.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:28.060]   So anytime any of his stuff got claimed, he would claim it for his end song as well.
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:31.420]   And then he shared the claim on any of his own videos.
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:37.500]   And Apple says monopolies aren't bad if they're not abused.
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.500]   This is Tim Cook.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.500]   That's the first time.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.500]   That was a really good segue right there.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.500]   Don't abuse it, Tim.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.500]   Don't abuse that.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.500]   I'm an Opelite Tim.
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:48.500]   He's looking at me right now.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.500]   You know that.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.500]   Don't play it.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:51.340]   Don't play it, Leo.
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.340]   Oh, the night.
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.340]   Daniel reports.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:54.340]   I double.
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:55.340]   Oh, oh.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:59.500]   Oh, Tim Cook has defended the existence of monopolies in a business because it's not
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:02.180]   bad as long as you don't abuse it.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.600]   This was an interview with the Nikke Asian review on Wednesday.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.220]   He said, we're not a monopoly.
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.420]   But if we were, if we were, you wouldn't be bad.
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:14.260]   Don't you think this is the first time we've missed Steve Dowling being in that room?
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.700]   Oh, I don't think that would have, I don't think that would have been the headline of
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:17.700]   Dowling.
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.700]   It's still been there.
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:19.700]   Yeah.
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:20.700]   Not a monopoly.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.700]   Don't play that song.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:25.740]   What Steve means is he's not playing the monopoly game because, you know, he doesn't
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.460]   like to play the boot.
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.780]   Apple has more job openings now than ever.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:33.780]   Look at that.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:34.780]   Why is that?
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.940]   We're going to need another iron.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:43.540]   There are 5,280 jobs listed on the Apple career site up from a seasonal low of 3,900
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:47.900]   last April and 530 more openings than this time last year.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.660]   Because AirPods.
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:57.700]   Those AirPods, man, they're hiring more software and services professionals than in hardware.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.700]   All right.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.580]   So go get a job at the, at the campus.
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:02.580]   Go get a job.
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:04.220]   That's from ThinkNum.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:09.020]   And when you do get a job at the campus, you'll get free genetic testing.
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:11.900]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:13.340]   This is looking for mutants.
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:14.980]   Don't fall for it.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:19.020]   This is through AC wellness.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:24.260]   Apple employees can get free genetic screenings for diseases from their on-site health clinics
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:29.580]   thanks to a pilot partnership with Color Genomics.
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:31.580]   I read this article this morning.
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:38.700]   I think it was ABC and it was this very sort of dystopian future by, you know, all of
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:44.060]   our allowing technology into our lives through video cameras and things like that.
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.740]   It was kind of like a, not attacking, but it was kind of reminding us as humans that
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:54.580]   maybe we shouldn't give over everything about ourselves to corporations.
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:59.500]   You know, this idea that 1984 was that, you know, the government comes in and like takes
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:04.540]   all of your life from you and your personality from you.
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:08.660]   And this argument is basically saying, we're actually just kind of giving it to everyone,
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:09.660]   right?
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:13.380]   And we're giving it to corporations right now who in turn in our future could then give
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.740]   it to government.
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:22.660]   And so when I saw this genetic testing article, it added to that in this very weird way of
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:33.740]   like, that's how the future happens is where we let governments into, you know, the ring
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:39.540]   is a perfect example of its owned by a company who uses it to help us so that we can protect
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:42.380]   ourselves from predators that might come to our front door.
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:45.740]   But it also shares that information with the police.
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.780]   And that's the starting point, right?
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.260]   So right now it's fine.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.620]   It starts with the police.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:54.540]   And then the next thing you know, we have cameras inside of our houses that the government
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:55.700]   is watching us.
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:25:00.860]   And then, you know, Apple lets us do, or offers genetic testing so that we can find out about
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.700]   our past and our history.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:07.420]   But then, you know, the government then eventually gets that information and starts like weeding
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.700]   out who's allowed to have jobs.
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:16.660]   Like, it's a little bit scary and I'm not usually that kind of a, you know, you would
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:17.660]   never do this.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:21.700]   You're afraid that that information would be used against you like in Gaddaka.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.900]   A little bit.
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:28.740]   I haven't done it because I actually was given that as a gift one year for Christmas and
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.500]   I never, I never went through it.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.540]   My genetic information is sprayed all over the internet.
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:35.140]   I chose it.
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.140]   Aaron is mostly Taryn.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:41.100]   I did 23andMe, which was a sponsor.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.940]   And then another one, which was a sponsor.
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.260]   I can't remember the name of it.
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.260]   And I don't.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:48.060]   So Leah won't do it for free, but he will do it for money.
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.060]   Spit samples.
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:52.340]   No, I did 23andMe before they were a sponsor.
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.340]   Spit samples.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.340]   They got it.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.460]   It's in the, it's in the storage locker somewhere.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.460]   I don't know.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.460]   What are you going to do?
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:00.460]   Do you feel like I still think I still want the interesting things.
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:01.460]   I'll go ahead.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:02.460]   Renee.
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:03.660]   No, no, I was just making a bad joke.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:04.900]   All Cogan joke.
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:05.900]   I just think I was a Vulcan.
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:09.580]   Before you at all Vulcan, my blood is a little, it has a greenish tinge.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:15.740]   I think the interesting thing though is I do think that there is this combining biometrics
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:20.420]   with our DNA that is going to be really powerful.
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.620]   Now if it's anonymized, hopefully is where we want to go.
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:24.220]   I do all the Apple Health research.
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:29.900]   But if you match that to your DNA, there's going to be a point where Apple knows, you
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:35.820]   know, there's things that you, that we see that is going to affect you in a year or two
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:40.500]   years that you could change now because we understand that the, I remember, I was talking
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.420]   to a geneticist at a, you know, at a dinner or whatever.
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:46.820]   And they were talking about eventually being able to make drugs, you know, all those side
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:48.060]   effects are because of your DNA background.
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:52.540]   The best cancer drugs are tuned to the DNA of the cancer.
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:55.420]   He said it'll get down to like you have a headache and we just know which one to give
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.060]   you because of your genetic background, you know.
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:58.900]   I think that's going to be in the next few decades.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:26:59.900]   Right.
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:02.900]   And so the, and then insurance companies are going to use it against the moment we're
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.900]   born because of what has to be.
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:06.900]   We got our great grandparent here.
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:08.900]   The designer babies think of the designer babies.
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:11.580]   The insurance company, by the way, asks you all these questions.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:14.420]   And if you lie, then they have a good reason not to give you insurance.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.580]   So they know it anyway.
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.060]   They're not, they're not, they're not wholesome.
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:20.900]   They're looking for reasons not to pay out.
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:24.860]   And so they're going to try to, and they know that if they issue a challenge that that's
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.780]   at least six to eight months of an arbitration, which they don't have to actually pay out,
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.780]   and maybe you'll give up a solution to that.
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:35.380]   It's not to stop genetic research, but to get rid of insurance companies.
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:39.100]   I don't think anybody's suggesting we stop genetic research, but I do believe that they
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:40.900]   should be better controlled.
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:44.700]   That's one of the reasons why Apple has to do this through a separate company.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:48.620]   They can't, in California, at least, I don't know if that's nationwide, they're prohibited,
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:54.060]   a company's prohibited from collecting genetic information from their employees, specifically,
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.700]   because of the abuse that can happen.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:28:02.820]   But the dimension that I want to add to this is that you always have to be prepared for,
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:06.780]   again, I'm not anti-government, I'm not, I fear the cops, I fear this, I'm saying that
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:11.340]   there's a reason why there's, there are limits to the power of government and police and
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:12.340]   law enforcement.
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:15.380]   It's because abuse is a really, really big problem.
[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:19.860]   So when you start off with a problem, when you start off the situation that people are
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:24.060]   putting cameras in their homes just to protect their property, or at least to be able to
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:27.820]   see if there's a theft that maybe catch the person, that's logical.
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:32.500]   And then you have the point, then you abstract it to one level in which, well, now this data
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.660]   is out there somewhere.
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:38.420]   And if you are in law enforcement and is your job to keep a community safe and you know
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:43.900]   there is footage out there on a server of this data that could help you solve a problem
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:47.060]   and solve a crime, you're going to try to go and get after it.
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:51.660]   This is the exact problem that all, every tech company is facing, the hearings that were
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:56.180]   taking place last week with Apple and other companies being grilled over encryption on
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.180]   phones.
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:01.660]   It's not that you couldn't get, you couldn't pass a law requiring people to make sure that
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:06.060]   all of your messaging, all of your data, all your contacts, all of your map information
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:09.140]   is stored in a central location where the government can get at it.
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:10.540]   They would never fly.
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:16.100]   But our government is to the democratic and, and Republican senators on both sides of
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.300]   the aisle are insisting that the fact that this data exists on this device means that
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:26.020]   we should be able to get at it to solve problems that we want to solve.
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:32.620]   It's not that it's up to us to not collect this apparently to begin with because eventually
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:37.700]   someone is going to say so long as there is a key to unlock a problem that we need, we
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:42.780]   feel that we need to unlock, it is your responsibility to make sure that the government and our law
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:46.540]   enforcement can get access to that key.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:50.460]   That's one of the problems of having lots of genetic information being recorded out there
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:53.780]   because well look, if there is a database somewhere and I don't care if it's a private
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:58.260]   database, if we can just simply match this DNA sample against not just all the people
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:02.340]   who participated in volunteer to participate in this test or paid to participate in this
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:06.980]   test, but everybody related to these people, well, what is your argument against helping
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.180]   us to solve these horrible brutal crimes?
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:10.860]   Are you that much of a mad man?
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.340]   Are you that much of a cruel person?
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:17.100]   You don't want this murder to be solved and for the relatives to get some closure?
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.100]   That's the real difficulty.
[01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:21.860]   That's the thing we have to make sure we put the brakes on from the very beginning.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:29.300]   It's defending a fundamental human right, a personal right as a free citizen of a hopefully
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:32.540]   free country.
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:36.060]   So it's time for our picks of the weekend, I do not know.
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.900]   You start, why don't you?
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:42.780]   I'm going to start with that we're talking about nostalgia and it reminded me that on
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:47.140]   archive.org and other places, but archive.org is a great place.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:52.860]   They actually have on built in, they have a web based hypercard emulators and Mac emulators.
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:57.660]   So if you want to like play AinaGo gets out for the first time since you were a teenager
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:06.340]   or a kid, you can just go to archive.org, click on this link and it's wonderful because
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:11.380]   it has to run a full like classic Macintosh emulator through your web browser.
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:15.620]   So you will see like the flashing like question, you will see the black and white classic
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:20.420]   Mac screen, a flashing disc cursor, which will then turn into a happy Mac that will then
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:23.420]   turn into a finder desktop with two floppies on it.
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.940]   You have to double click on it on the on the disk and run the stack.
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:31.700]   And then you are running AinaGo gets out probably as it's probably just as fast as on
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:36.020]   your classic Mac and it's almost probably almost certainly because the web browser is slowing
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:40.500]   it down to make sure that that doesn't sound in cent.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:44.220]   But yeah, there are all kinds of other like online games, excuse me, all kinds of other
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:47.980]   classic Mac games and apps that you can run through emulators.
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:49.700]   This is my favorite dark castle.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.060]   I just yeah, they have Aztec.
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:53.300]   I don't know.
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:54.300]   I don't know.
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.100]   Let me see how I see it.
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.660]   Yeah, it's it is such a trip.
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:04.940]   It's like it's like when like your when your parents like say, hey, look, we can't we can't
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:06.420]   get cars parked into it.
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.900]   We can't get cars in the in the garage and the basement.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:10.380]   I can't get things in the basement.
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:13.580]   Like everybody, all the kids are you kids, you're going to come over and your guys basically
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.580]   help clean us out.
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:17.700]   And then you find this box that you scroll away there.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.100]   Like before you went to college has been untouched.
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:24.740]   And suddenly you have like you have like the notebook of really bad poetry you wrote.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:29.260]   You suddenly have like your trapper keeper with all the stickers and stuff on it.
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:34.660]   Isn't this the best game ever?
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:36.780]   Yeah, yeah, man, I love dark castle.
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:38.860]   I wish I could figure out how to roll.
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:43.220]   Oh, this is pretty much how I played it even when I had a man.
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:44.220]   Exactly.
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:45.220]   Lots of dead.
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:51.100]   This is what desensitized this kids to death and violence being killed in the first two
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:52.540]   seconds of every game.
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:56.300]   Let's go back and I was playing beginner mode.
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.100]   Let's go back to the.
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:32:59.980]   I want to hear the.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.700]   Let's see.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:03.860]   Is there any sound?
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:07.020]   I guess there's no music.
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:08.020]   It's amazing.
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:09.540]   Isn't it that they've got there we go.
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:10.540]   This is the level.
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:11.540]   Oh, those bats.
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:14.540]   They get me every time.
[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:22.500]   Oh, thank you, Andy, for reminding us the entire.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.500]   Archive is here.
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.340]   It's really incredible.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:28.540]   So that's your Wednesday, Thursday and Friday kind of shot.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.540]   Yeah.
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.580]   Have you by the way, have you visited the Internet Archive?
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.580]   Oh, I love it.
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:33.820]   Oh, they want money.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:34.820]   They're going broke.
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:39.380]   They're looking for donations and you should donate because.
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.900]   It looks just like that building.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:41.900]   They bought this.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:44.700]   Oh, you mean they have a building that looks like there's a building in the Internet Archive
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:45.940]   in San Francisco.
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.420]   It's just south of the golden.
[01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:49.140]   There's the building right there.
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:55.460]   It actually is an old Christian science temple or whatever and it's massive.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.180]   Yeah, it's it's unbelievable.
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:01.900]   I think this is the best thing you should I give money to the Wayback machine.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:02.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:04.140]   Folks, this is the best thing ever.
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:09.100]   We don't want to lose our history or heritage or dark castle.
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:10.100]   Alex, you have a pick?
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.100]   I do.
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.020]   This one is simple, but but effective.
[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:18.980]   This is a so I travel a lot.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.860]   And when you're traveling, you want to throw your map up.
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:23.460]   You know, you want to put your phone up on your on your on your car.
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:24.460]   Yeah.
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:28.220]   And I just need something that I can put into that will work with any car that I might rent
[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:31.020]   if I'm running a car or my or my car or whatever.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.500]   And I just stick it on and then I can just slap my phone on to it.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:36.860]   So I don't not hooking it up or trying to push it between things.
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:37.860]   And so this is a scat.
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:38.860]   It's called scat.
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:42.020]   They make a couple of them, but this one seems to be the best one.
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.020]   I got it.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:45.420]   I went through a couple of them and this isn't the one I'm happy with.
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:46.420]   The scat magnetic.
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:49.900]   I don't know if you guys have used any of these magnetic holders, but it's magnetic
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:50.900]   holder.
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:51.900]   It fits on to your vent.
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.900]   You just push it.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:55.140]   It just sits right onto the vent.
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:58.500]   And I've been using it for like a year now.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:34:59.500]   And so I.
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.740]   Then you have to put a metal plate on your phone though.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.740]   I don't think you do.
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:03.740]   I think you can hook it.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.580]   I think your phone will just it'll your phone will just snap right.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.540]   It's magnetic enough.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.540]   It's very magnetic.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:15.420]   Now I use I have to know I had to put a metal plate on the iPad and I see you have to put
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:16.580]   that metal plate on it.
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.100]   That kills wireless charging, which is really annoying.
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:21.100]   I don't care about wireless charging.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:24.060]   I don't even like wireless charging on my watch.
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:28.100]   So I have this Vena, this Vena case.
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:29.100]   So it's metal.
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:30.100]   It does not wire less charge.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:31.580]   It was metal on the back.
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:33.580]   That's a lot.
[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:39.860]   And so I just I just but I just love the fact that I go snap and it just it snaps on and
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:43.340]   there's not a lot of fiddling about and and and messing with it.
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:50.020]   So do you use heater in the winter time so that the heat blows out of those vents and
[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:53.140]   then if so, have you noticed and yeah, is there an issue?
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:54.140]   I do use the heater.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:58.060]   I do use you know heat and I haven't had any trouble at all.
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.620]   We don't have really winter winter here.
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:03.100]   It's kind of like somewhat cold or chilly as you know.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:06.980]   So at least where I live it gets a little chilly, but that's about it.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:08.300]   He's just Pittsburgh weather.
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.140]   So he doesn't need a heater in his car.
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:11.140]   Exactly.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.140]   He wears a sweater.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:15.380]   Usually if I have heat, I will admit that I'm usually defrost.
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:18.580]   You know, is kind of my my version of heater because and the reason mostly is because I
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:23.220]   have this old BMW that has a little thing that I have to scroll up and down to get hotter
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:27.500]   cold air out of my vents, you know, because it'll always be warm or always be less kind
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.500]   of based on it.
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:32.420]   No matter what temperature you set to the which is kind of cool, but also have a switch
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:34.740]   for the reserve tank on the floor.
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:35.740]   We should do it.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:36.740]   That would be awesome.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.060]   No, it's not that old.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:42.340]   I'll just show you what I use because I kept seeing the ads on the NFL for weather tech.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:48.900]   They make a cup phone holder that goes into your cup holder and they have a different
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:50.220]   sizes and they put it in there.
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:54.460]   The only thing I'll say I have this and I bought the extension as well for it.
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:55.500]   The only thing bad about it.
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:37:00.940]   It's a little rattly and maybe my cup holder is just not exactly the right size.
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:03.340]   You see you have different sizes and I kind of like that.
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:05.660]   I got a pinch on my side.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:10.220]   I got to say, I hate the fact you have to look down at your floorboard to see your screen.
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:15.860]   I'll say the one of the biggest, best and cheapest luxuries that I have ever purchased
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:23.220]   in my life was having like a real phone mount, hard installed in my dashboard.
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:24.220]   You can do it.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:25.220]   Exactly the place.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:26.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:27.220]   No, it's not that difficult.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:30.780]   As a matter of fact, what they often do is they pop out the they don't have to take apart
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:31.780]   your dashboard.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:34.980]   They actually will pop out event, which is designed to pull out and then you can get
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:40.260]   access to like the roof of that dash panel or the front face.
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:46.900]   When you get to decide that I want my phone to be at eye level, the exact same level as
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:55.420]   my rear view mirrors, I want it to be right here to the left of my steering wheel.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:56.420]   It's not going to rattle.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:57.620]   It's not going to bump off.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:03.460]   I'm not going to accidentally knock it off when I'm going from place to place.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:10.100]   It feels like the most luxurious thing ever that this is not a half arched solution.
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:13.700]   This is not a make do with here's the best we can do by plugging something into something
[01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:14.700]   you don't exist.
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:16.420]   Next best thing you have car play, if you had car play, that would be.
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:17.420]   I hate car play.
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:24.580]   My next car is the I'm going to get that Mustang Mach-E, the electric Ford at the end of the
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:28.420]   year and that has wireless car play and a cheap charger.
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:33.100]   So you just put your phone on the cheap pad and it sits there and it's our doing car play.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:37.820]   I think everything I can do with my I'm used to being able to search.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:39.500]   No, you've got to drive, dude.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.900]   You can't be messing around with your phone.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:45.220]   When I'm in the passenger seat, I'm in the passenger seat with my wife's car.
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:46.540]   I want to find a song.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:48.620]   I can't do that on car play.
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:52.300]   It's just like you can use the playlists, but you can't go search for something.
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:53.300]   I'm not the driver.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.380]   I'm in the passenger seat trying to find a song that I can't do that.
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:00.300]   Burke says, don't get that weather tick.
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:07.100]   You need the Ram Mount stubby drink that cup base with X grip and black.
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:08.100]   Holy smokes.
[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:10.700]   Yes, that is that was my God.
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:14.020]   What no, no, I'm telling you the Ram Mount stuff.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:15.980]   That's what I went with when I had it hard installed.
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:19.780]   It's a system you can buy all kinds of different holders and extensions.
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:22.020]   And this is the thing that will hold on.
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:23.020]   It works.
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:24.020]   Oh, yep.
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:25.180]   No, they have they have iPad Harlers.
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:29.020]   They have laptop holders that they design things for cop cars.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:33.060]   They design things for anytime you want to install anything in a car that involves an
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:35.300]   electronic device, they will give you.
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:37.860]   Oh, well, we managed to sort of accommodate this.
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:41.660]   They will give that X grip that they're showing right now is perfect.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:45.420]   They're like four fingers that are sort of like spring loaded against each other.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:49.300]   So they will simply rip off the way because when there's no bottom, my mind just keeps
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:50.300]   slipping.
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:52.700]   Well, you can make it be a bottom, can't you?
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:53.700]   I've put that.
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:54.940]   You can.
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:56.780]   I'm telling you it grips.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:59.940]   It grips hard enough to not certainly not damage anything that's going on.
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:01.420]   It's a waste shown here.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:06.460]   But it's very, very, very tight springs that actually takes a little bit of force for you
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.220]   to spring them open.
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:11.940]   But when they close around it and you can easily take it out again.
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:14.700]   And again, the great thing about it is it's a system.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:20.340]   So when I switched cars, I was able to use like 75% or when I switched phones, I was able
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:24.140]   to like switch, keep 75%, 80% of the system.
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:29.220]   And just buy the different sort of head that I needed for my new much bigger phone.
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:33.100]   When I decided that when I was doing sort of a road trip with somebody and I wanted an
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:39.380]   iPad mini holder for the passenger side, again, I was able to reset because at this point,
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:43.460]   I have like a box of different Ram Mount parts and gizmos.
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:47.860]   All I had to do was like maybe buy one arm extension and then I could sort of build out
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:51.540]   of Legos exactly the sort of mounting system I needed for this thing.
[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:52.740]   Can't recommend them highly enough.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:57.860]   They don't cost that much more than what you get like a sharper image, like fake Chinese
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:59.540]   brand sort of thing.
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:02.260]   But dang it, these things last and they're so versatile.
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:04.420]   And he's rusting me money.
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:05.420]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:08.900]   As you go with it, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:10.580]   A couple of things.
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:14.700]   One, just for people, we were mentioning my lights in the beginning of the episode.
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:19.140]   So I just wanted to put the link in with the picks of the week at their digital Sputnik
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:23.180]   Voyager and they probably cost an Alex per light.
[01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:27.700]   But what they do that a lot of lights can't do is they're not even just LED, but they're
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:28.700]   like screens.
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:32.220]   You can program them to have different colors in different areas.
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:34.180]   And again, I heard about them on the Mandalorian.
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:38.020]   So I had to have them and there's an app and you can take photographs and they will try
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:39.500]   to match the colors in the photograph.
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:45.300]   And you can make them into like police lights and chase lights and highway lights going over
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:46.300]   you.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.180]   They're just infinitely programmable.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:52.060]   So those are digital Sputnik Voyager.
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:56.140]   But the thing I wanted to talk about also was snowflake weather.
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:00.780]   And it's particularly apt for people in the great country of Australia who are losing
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:05.780]   the fabulous pocket weather, an app that I was never allowed to use because I believe
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:08.540]   the developer Russell is just anti-Canadian.
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:10.380]   But that's my head theory.
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:15.900]   But yeah, so this isn't you weather app full disclosures by a friend of mine, Mark Edwards
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.020]   of the Django.
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:19.540]   I keep calling it B-ango, but it's really a bajango.
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:21.340]   They make the wonderful I-stat menu.
[01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:22.580]   Oh, I love I-
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:24.260]   So I just got the snowflake weather.
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.660]   It is so awesome.
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:29.660]   Yeah, so I-stat weather, I-stat menu has weather and it is this like-
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:30.660]   Yes.
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:33.260]   So he's gone all in and he is a designer, is designer.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:37.060]   Like he is the person who makes all the Photoshop and everything for other interface designers.
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:42.500]   So it is just as well thought out and particular and opinionated in the best possible sense
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:45.140]   of the way that you can imagine.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:52.100]   And for Australians, it will replace pocket weather if that's what you want to do.
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:54.500]   But for everybody else, it just brings a terrific-
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.500]   Weather apps are like a playground.
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.220]   They're like Twitter apps of 10 years ago.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:01.060]   They're just a place for some of the best developers and designers truly experiment
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:05.820]   with interface and data and they take these, what could be boring just data dumps and make
[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:09.540]   them visually pleasing and there's graphs and there's graphics and there's all these
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:10.540]   things.
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:12.340]   And it seems like there's limitless, really good takes.
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:16.460]   But this snowflake weather is just one of my favorite in quite a while.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:17.460]   Nice.
[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:19.460]   Snowflake weather.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:24.700]   I've decided I need access to my iPad all the time now.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:29.260]   So I have the Ram Mount microphone mount.
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:30.260]   Love that.
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:31.260]   That's perfect.
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:32.260]   Mm-hmm.
[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:33.260]   I think it's beefy.
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:34.260]   It's beefy.
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:35.260]   I couldn't get it out of that.
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:38.580]   I was like, oh, I thought I might have pulled a rotator cuff.
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:39.580]   Yeah, when I grabbed it.
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:40.580]   Get it in there.
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:41.820]   It's like made out of metal.
[01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:45.780]   Let me take that off so you can see me.
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:50.060]   My pick actually I ordered some time ago and it finally is here.
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:54.980]   In fact, we're going to do an unboxing of I think from Peak Design Ladies and Gentlemen
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:58.020]   I give you the travel tripod.
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:00.700]   It's finally here.
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:06.940]   This is Peak's way of making a compact, packable tripod.
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:10.460]   I got the fancy one, the carbon fiber.
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:14.100]   So it would be lighter, stronger, and more thievable.
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.300]   I think that's the one I ordered too.
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:19.180]   So as usual with the length on the box.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:22.820]   I forgot to, I don't know, why you've got to fit.
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:23.820]   It's a certain size.
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:24.820]   It's just the right size.
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:27.420]   It needs to be shorter than 18 inches.
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:29.980]   It looks like it might be.
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:32.980]   It actually says on here.
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:33.980]   I don't know.
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:34.980]   I'll open it up and you can measure.
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:36.900]   Yeah, it looks like it's 15.
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:37.900]   Yeah.
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:42.940]   It comes to this case which I didn't even know about which is quite nice.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:46.460]   And it really can be less than 21 inches and you can get away with it.
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:48.900]   And then here is, go ahead.
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.660]   Well, this is heavier than that ram thing.
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:55.180]   Oh, that'll totally fit into a carry on.
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.180]   Yeah, this is nice.
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:45:00.060]   So the idea is you can take a full-size tripod along with you.
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:03.420]   Now this is the expensive one which means it's almost 500 bucks.
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:04.420]   Cabin fighter.
[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:06.980]   But a good tripod costs that much.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:10.500]   I just want to know if I can fit a floating head onto it somehow.
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:11.500]   Wow.
[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:14.100]   I'm sure someone will come up with that.
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:20.460]   Yeah, it does not have a floating head but it does have a head of some kind.
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:22.500]   And it looks like it's got a lock on it.
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.500]   They said it would fit.
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:24.500]   Yeah, it does.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.500]   It has the standard.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.500]   How do you level it?
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:30.500]   It has a level.
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:36.180]   It has what I think is really important on every tripod, a hook.
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:39.140]   You can put your sandbag or your camera bag.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:41.380]   And then of course, I just don't--
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:42.380]   I just use my jacket.
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:44.380]   Look at that.
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:50.020]   And doesn't the hook pull out and turn into an iPhone tripod mount?
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:51.020]   Oh, does it?
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.020]   Oh.
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:53.940]   So there's a lot of features on this that I don't know about.
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:55.460]   It's like Batman's Tripodleo.
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:56.460]   It is a battery tripod.
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:46:02.660]   No, the impression I got and I love this about is that it seemed like a really, really talented
[01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:04.500]   photographers version of the Home Remobile.
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:05.500]   So you know what?
[01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.580]   I want a couple of us here, here, here, and here.
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:10.540]   I want a separate bubble to the kids for the bags so I don't have to hear them.
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:11.540]   It's like every single thing you--
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:12.540]   I'll let Alex--
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:13.540]   Yes, Alex, who knows--
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:16.540]   Everything I think that annoyed people about the right buds.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:18.740]   I'll let you mess with that.
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:19.740]   Anyway--
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:20.740]   I'll take the small ones.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:21.740]   They're out now.
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:22.740]   They were-- it was a Kickstarter.
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:26.020]   I'm glad it came in time for Christmas as my Christmas present to myself.
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:27.020]   The peak travel--
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.020]   You deserve it, Lee.
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:29.020]   I like peak stuff.
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.020]   I have peak stuff all over.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:31.020]   They're so good.
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.020]   You look at the new bags yet?
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.460]   No, they have an as new bags that are supposed to be.
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.140]   Those are even better than their formerly great bags.
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:38.780]   It's got a little ball mount.
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:39.780]   It does have a ball mount.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:40.780]   All right.
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:41.780]   For leveling?
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:42.780]   It's not-- oh, for leveling.
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:43.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:44.780]   No, it's great.
[01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:45.780]   I mean, that's great.
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:46.780]   And it has-- it looks like it has-- does it have a little--
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:48.340]   It's got a little bubble.
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:49.340]   Bubble?
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:50.340]   Yeah.
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:51.340]   So there you go.
[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:52.340]   So you can actually-- that's actually the way to do it.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:58.220]   My Gizzo has a bubble, but it's on the pole that you rotate with and if the camera's
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:46:59.860]   set wrong, it won't matter.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:03.900]   Waiting for somebody to do a digital bubble that ties to my iPhone so I can look at my
[01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:04.900]   iPhone.
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:07.820]   You'd re-surprise that how often I would use that if I-- because there's always this
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:10.540]   thing of promising to put your camera on it and then you can't see the bubble.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.540]   And so--
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:14.300]   Can't you ever have something to talk to it would be amazing.
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:16.100]   I'm just saying.
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:19.740]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded this-- wait a minute.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:20.740]   No, we haven't.
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:22.300]   Laurie Gill, your pick of the week.
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:25.740]   Well, I mean, how can I follow your unboxing?
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:27.620]   Well, I meant to do that last.
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:28.620]   I apologize.
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:29.620]   I forgot.
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:30.620]   Oh, sorry.
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:31.620]   So it's OK.
[01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:33.340]   Mine is actually pretty cool too.
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:44.420]   It's not as cool as that titanium travel tripod, but for anybody who likes Studio Ghibli films,
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:48.820]   they are now available on iTunes, I believe, for the first time ever.
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:53.260]   And my favorite of the Studio Ghibli films is Spirit Out Away by Hyle.
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:55.260]   Yeah.
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:48:01.620]   So if you haven't seen it, I know $20 seems like a lot, especially if you've never seen
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:02.620]   it before.
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:07.100]   So find away somewhere to rent it or wait a little longer because it's probably going
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:09.620]   to be available to rent at some point on iTunes.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:11.500]   It might even show up on Disney Plus.
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:15.580]   I don't know, because a lot of Miyazaki films, a lot of the Studio Ghibli films are also
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:18.500]   there like Disney combined.
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:20.620]   So maybe it'll show up on Disney Plus.
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:24.980]   But if you love any of these films and you've always wanted a digital version of them, a
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:28.180]   bunch of the Studio Ghibli films are now available on iTunes.
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:29.340]   I hear a little voice.
[01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:30.340]   What, Carsten?
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:34.580]   When HBO Max launches, it will be on HBO Max.
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:35.580]   There you go.
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:38.300]   So that's a place you can watch it if you've never seen it before.
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:39.300]   Buy it $20.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:42.060]   It'll probably be a better quality anyway, right?
[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:43.060]   4K and all that.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:45.420]   Look, you're right, there's a little iPhone.
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:46.420]   It's amazing.
[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:49.700]   It's a little bit of this thing and they put this thing in the starter.
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.660]   That's what I love to do design.
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:53.660]   I love it because you'll design it.
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:54.660]   Here is what.
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:58.380]   The questions that you watch a video to understand how to use this thing.
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:48:59.860]   So I'll be watching that video.
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:06.500]   Gee, there's a sort of like, we designed this thing to have a hollow tube in there just
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:07.500]   for structural reason.
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:10.780]   But gee, that's some space that we could actually take advantage of.
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:12.260]   What could we do with it?
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:15.980]   It's sort of like when you have a Swiss army knife that's been in your pocket for 10 years
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:19.660]   and then suddenly, like you, for some reason, you're looking at it from an odd angle and
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:23.060]   then you flip out the corkscrew and realize there has been like an inch and a half, two
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:28.020]   inch, like straight common pin, like hidden behind it ever since that you've never, ever,
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:29.020]   ever known about.
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:33.500]   And my God, they realize that at some point someone might need like a sharp pin and they
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.140]   said, what the hell put it in there?
[01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:36.140]   That's great.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:38.740]   There's something about pulling this little guy out that's so James Bond.
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:39.740]   Just don't know.
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:40.740]   It's expensive.
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:43.100]   It's like it's like it's like never giving it to Alex.
[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:44.940]   It's like that extra handgun in your sock.
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:46.340]   The God they didn't fit in first.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:47.340]   Good enough.
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:48.660]   Shouldn't have given it to Alex.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:50.060]   It's never coming back in one piece.
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:52.060]   I can tell right now.
[01:49:52.060 --> 01:49:53.740]   He's already converted into rapid fire.
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:56.660]   Don't put a bump stock on it.
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:00.540]   That concludes our show for the day.
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:03.180]   Thank you, Renee, Richie Imore.com/vector.
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:06.020]   Renee is constantly producing videos.
[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:07.020]   All sorts of great stuff.
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:09.220]   Anything you want to plug that's coming up soon?
[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:10.580]   I did want to really like yesterday.
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:14.060]   It took me forever to do it, but I took all the footage I could find from Apple from the
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:19.620]   last 10 years, the good stuff, the products, the controversies, the humans, the education,
[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:23.580]   the accessibility, the silicon, the environment, all of that.
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:26.060]   And I tried to do 10 years and 10 minutes.
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:31.700]   I went just slightly over, but I got almost everything from Steve Jobs and the original
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:38.020]   iPad to the Mac Pro and new 6-inch MacBook Pro in about 10 minutes.
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:39.020]   Nice.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:40.020]   I'm really happy with how it turned out.
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:41.020]   Nice.
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:42.020]   It's really good.
[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:45.300]   I have to watch i'more.com/vector.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:47.540]   Laurie Gill, managing editor at i'more.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:49.340]   What's coming up for you?
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:50.340]   I got nothing.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:53.500]   I'm taking a Christmas break.
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:54.500]   So are we.
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:55.500]   Well, sort of.
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:57.140]   No, actually, we're going to be back.
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:02.300]   And you guys all know we're doing the show Monday next week because Tuesday's Christmas
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:04.220]   Eve, I couldn't make you do that.
[01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:08.980]   So all of our Tuesday shows are shifting over to Monday for next week.
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:13.020]   I was kind of counting on that gold plated excuse to avoid going to the extended family
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:14.020]   holiday.
[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:16.500]   I still tell people that's on Friday.
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:17.500]   It's on Tuesday.
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:18.500]   Okay.
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:19.500]   We'll do that today.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.500]   They'll never know the difference.
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:23.140]   Andy and I go, when will you be on GBH?
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:25.860]   I was actually moved from Friday to Monday this week.
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:29.460]   So I was on yesterday, but that's still available on streaming at WGBHNews.org.
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:34.020]   I've got next week off because of holiday, but I'll be on the week after that on Friday,
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:35.580]   the January 3rd.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:36.580]   I think.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:37.580]   Nice.
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:39.580]   Alex Lindsey, what's coming up for you?
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:41.940]   I'm working on it.
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:44.300]   Alex Lindsey on the Twitter, if you want to know.
[01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:45.300]   I did post.
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.700]   You said I should take pictures of it.
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:49.260]   I will post some pictures of my little home studio that I'm working on.
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:50.260]   I want to see that.
[01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:52.140]   Right now it's a little bit of a disaster because I'm still figuring it out.
[01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:59.340]   But I did post at your behest, I post the wiring diagram for the studio, which I've never
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:00.340]   done.
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:01.940]   I've never posted a wired diagram in public.
[01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:04.380]   So we build these for pretty much everything.
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:08.660]   Like every kit, every whatever I build in my omnigraffle.
[01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:12.660]   And so before I start wiring, this is how I think about it.
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:13.660]   Wow.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:18.060]   And you sit there and go, "Well, should I do this or should this cable connect to that?"
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:21.140]   And so I sit there and kind of think through it.
[01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:22.140]   And I talk a little bit.
[01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:24.300]   This is smart because you have a diagram of the patching.
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:25.300]   Well, and what makes it easier is...
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:27.900]   I should have done this with my home stereo.
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:30.860]   What happens is that you think through it, you go, "Oh, you start grouping things the
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:32.700]   way you want to group them in the router."
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:34.300]   So there's things that are in fours.
[01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:36.020]   Anyway, I explained a little bit on Twitter.
[01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:39.980]   There's a thread there where I kind of talk about why I did what I did there.
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:42.980]   And what it allows me to do is, again, think through it.
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:46.180]   And then when I'm building it, I can listen to music and just kind of go, "Do the only
[01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:51.100]   guy I know has a Blackmagic 40 port video hub in his house."
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:54.100]   And how can you live with that?
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:56.100]   Like an animal out of 40.
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:57.100]   40 by 40.
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:59.100]   I mean, you've got that right.
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:00.100]   40 in there.
[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:01.100]   And four Skype machines.
[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:02.940]   No, no, not four Skype machines.
[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:04.140]   That's just one.
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:07.820]   That's the talk show with four.
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.180]   Ah, four with one machine.
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:11.900]   So you've got four different Skype machines in one.
[01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:12.900]   Exactly.
[01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:14.260]   That way you can talk about it.
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:18.380]   Why buy four computers when you could buy one that's more than four times as expensive?
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.100]   But way easier to manage.
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:21.100]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:24.100]   Did I get everybody?
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:25.100]   All right.
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.220]   Again, Monday, 11 a.m.
[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:28.220]   Pacific, 2 p.m.
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:31.180]   Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:36.060]   This next coming week only because of Christmas, we're going to do it the day before Christmas
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:37.060]   Eve.
[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:39.060]   So if you want to watch live, twit.tv/live.
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:40.860]   Normally, we're on Tuesdays at 11 a.m.
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:41.860]   Pacific.
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:45.020]   Twit.tv/live has audio and video streams.
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:47.180]   You can also join the chatroom if you're watching live.
[01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:51.820]   It's always great to chat live at irc.twit.tv.
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:57.980]   For those of you who have a life, you can always get the on-demand version at twit.tv/mbw
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:02.060]   or at YouTube or if you subscribe, you'll make sure you never miss an episode because
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:06.420]   it'll automatically download to your favorite podcast application.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:11.020]   If you're not watching in real time, you might want to still join a community.
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:15.780]   We have a great forum now that kind of duplicates what IRC does in real time.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:19.700]   We synchronously at twit.community and you're more than welcome to join us there.
[01:54:19.700 --> 01:54:21.820]   I think it's a lot of fun.
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:23.220]   All the shows are represented.
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:28.420]   Many of the hosts, it's a great place to not just talk about the shows but anything that's
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:30.980]   on your mind.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:34.260]   There's conversations about pretty much everything.
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:35.260]   Twit.community.
[01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:38.100]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:39.100]   We'll see you next time.
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:42.260]   Now get back to work because the big time is over.
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.260]   See ya.
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:44.260]   [music]
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:55.540]   [music]
