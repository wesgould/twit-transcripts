[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.580]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.400]   I lost my head there.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.960]   Here he is, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.960]   from visiting his family in Pittsburgh,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.080]   normally in studio with us.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.360]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.360]   Hello.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.520]   Hey, are you going to be there through Christmas?
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.020]   I know.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.840]   I'm just here until Thursday, and then I'm in DC for a day,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.200]   and our day or two.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   And then I'm back this weekend.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.800]   It's been a while all the time.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.320]   All the time.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.760]   Well, I'm glad you could get on.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.040]   Yeah, I'm glad to be on.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.080]   Am I coming through OK?
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.880]   You're coming through?
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.160]   I'm clear.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.640]   Excellent.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.160]   Excellent.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.800]   Are you on the middle of nowhere?
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   Are you?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.640]   What are you on?
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.760]   I'm on-- it's a DSL.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.280]   But it looks--
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.880]   but if it looks OK, yeah.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.360]   It's not a particularly fast connection,
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.200]   but it seems to be fast.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   And why is it stable?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.800]   That's more important than fast.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.520]   I'm the only one using it, and I really am in the middle of nowhere.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.440]   I can't see another house from this house.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.760]   So I think I don't think anyone else is using it.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.640]   It's just me.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.520]   This is where Alex blew up things in his youth.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.480]   And all the neighbors moved away.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.440]   Also, we're hoping to avoid the FBI investigation.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.280]   Yesterday, I tried to avoid doing this with my son,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.120]   but he's gotten-- he's gone down that path,
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.960]   so I'm trying to--
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.460]   Tweet.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.120]   I saw your tweet.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.120]   But that was very interesting what you're up to.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.920]   Alex Lindsey is here as well as Andy Innaco from the Chicago
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.160]   Sun Times and the Celestial Waste of Banwith.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.440]   And from beautiful snowy Massachusetts, is it snowy?
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.920]   No, we were getting a two-day break from cold weather
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.840]   just long enough to resupply and bury the dead.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.280]   Most of the dead out in the dry way with the snow shovel.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.080]   Every day's a blessing.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.920]   We owe every day's a blessing.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.240]   And no one knows that better than Mr. Scott Bourne.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.920]   Hello, Scotty.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   Hello.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   Hello.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.920]   Good to see you.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.760]   Thank you very much for joining us today.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.920]   It's wonderful to be here in Gig Harbor.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.920]   No snowing gig Harbor.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920]   No snowing gig Harbor.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   No snowed all around us, but we were spared.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   Good.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   Good, good, good.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   Which is good because all the 84-year-old women get their rear
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   wheel drive catalax out and decide to test them on the one day
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   a year of snow is here.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   Let's see how this puppy goes in the snow.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.920]   That's the only day a year they drive, by the way.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.920]   Also with us in Newby, and we're really glad to have him.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.920]   Peter Kroeg, who I first met on a geek cruise.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.920]   Peter is the author of a classic work of nonfiction called
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.920]   The Damn Book, the DM Digital Asset Management.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.920]   Peter, good to talk to you.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   Yeah, there's great to be here, Leo.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.920]   I'm really, really pleased to see you again here over the
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920]   wire.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   I'm coming to you from my basement studio.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.920]   Here in downtown Kensington, Maryland, we're just outside
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.920]   Washington, D.C.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.920]   If you hear some knocking around in the background, that's my
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.920]   nephew who's outside helping to paint the studio on his Christmas
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.920]   break from college.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.920]   Isn't that nice?
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   Well, it's great to have you here.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.920]   Peter and I met in, actually, it wasn't a geek cruise.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   It was in Tasmania.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.920]   It was in Tasmania.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   It was, yeah, the Lightroom Adventure, too.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.920]   Boy, what fun that was.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   Yeah, just an amazing group of people and a heck of a good
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.920]   time, a lot of work.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   Anytime Michael Olin calls you up and says, "Hey, you want to do
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.920]   this?"
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.920]   My strong suggestion is to always say yes.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.920]   Yes.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.920]   I'm lobbying him to do Cuba before it changes dramatically.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   Would love to do a photo safari in Cuba.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   Anyway, we're going to talk about the Mac news.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.920]   First, though, Alex, I saw that your tweet that you wanted to
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   do a story by a Casio keyboard.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   So my son and I, we were reading a little too much of Make
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   Magazine and decided we'd have a little bit of fun.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   So we worked into this Radio Shack and we bought this
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.920]   Casio keyboard.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   The thing about the Casio is it's got all these chips that are
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   inside of it that do all these great sounds.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.920]   But you can't get to them from the keys.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   So what we did is we bought it, but the funny thing was we went
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.920]   up to the guy and he asked us, "Would you like to get an
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.920]   extended warranty?"
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   And I was like, "Yeah, we're going to rewire the motherboard."
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   And he just looked down.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.920]   He looked down.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920]   He was like, "Never mind."
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   I guess you still won't be getting that warranty there, huh?
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   In the old days, that's what you did at Radio Shack.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   Isn't it?
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.920]   You'd buy stuff and then you'd build stuff.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.920]   And I thought that he'd understand it because there was a
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   keyboard there.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   There was a soldering.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   I wasn't a soldering.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.920]   There was a bunch of equipment.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   Let's face it.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   It looked like you were bomb making with all the stuff that you
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920]   had in there, I'm sure.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.920]   So it was actually not the most frightening thing we did that
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.920]   night, which was my son took apart a disposable camera and it
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.920]   turns out that when you just push the little connectors to
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   charge it up and you can do a lot of damage to a set of pliers
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.920]   by just connecting the circuit.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.920]   It's quite amazing at how much voltage those little guys
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   keep coming from.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.920]   So anyway.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.920]   Yeah, I bet.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   And I was frightened that it was my son that was the one that
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   came up with it, not me.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   I was just kind of watching and trying to make sure he didn't
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   have a lot of work.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   So Peter's up to something kind of intriguing.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.920]   In fact, one of the reasons we're having you on, although I've
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   been dying to get you on Macbreak for a long time.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   You're working with the Library of Congress on something.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   We've been working on a project that's a three year project to
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   identify best practices in digital photography workflow.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   The interest of the library is to make sure that the digital
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.920]   record does not disappear.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.920]   They're worried that born digital photos might just go away.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   So one of the things that they're doing to address this is to
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.920]   find people who are experts in the field.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   And they've given us some money to go research how you should
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   work with your digital images and then put this information
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   out free to the entire world.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   So we've built this giant website that describes essentially
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   how all digital imaging technology works and also tells
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   the photographer, particularly the working photographer, how to
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   put it together in a sustainable workflow.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.920]   This is ties into your damn work, the digital asset
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   management work.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   Absolutely.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.920]   It's not a path I chose.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.920]   It's a path that chose me.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   Now it's yours.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   Yours for life, I'm afraid.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   I come at it as a photographer first, but God, I wish someone
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.920]   else would do it, but apparently it keeps falling to me to have
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   to figure out this crap out.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.920]   I have a great partner that I'm working with a guy named
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.920]   Richard Anderson, and it's been a real joy to work with somebody
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.920]   who will noodle around this stuff down to the very basement.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   It's something we all have to think about, really, not just
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   the Library of Congress, but we've all got a ton of digital --
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   our whole life is recorded digitally now.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   Yeah, I mean, you think about how just a simple hard drive
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   failure could wipe out your entire personal history.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   And we really don't want to have that happen.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   And the only way to protect is for us to teach people best
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   practices and how to take care of it.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   This stuff is particularly important to Alex because he's so
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   digital, he's got digital boogers.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.920]   Thank you for that nice image.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   He's got -- I try to contribute wherever I can.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.920]   It's just such as a beautiful --
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.920]   You know, getting a little too heavy.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   It's a beautiful thing there.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.920]   You're really very great at something.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.920]   Let's --
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   Go ahead.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.920]   All I was going to say is that I think that these kind of
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   things -- we've moved from saying that something doesn't exist
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   unless it exists in two places to three places after a near
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.920]   scary experience with some of our files.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   And the thing is that, you know, I know that within our
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.920]   company, we're trying to go to being completely paperless over
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.920]   the next year.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   Mostly out of efficiency.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   It's not really an environmental thing.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   We just don't want to deal with paper anymore.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   And so -- but that makes all of these things.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   Best practice of how we handle digital information extremely
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.920]   important because, you know, just a flick of a wrist can, you
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   know, get rid of, you know, years of stuff.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   So we have a simple way we like to say it is that you should have
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.920]   three-two-one backups, three copies of anything you want to
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.920]   keep, two different media, and one of them should be stored
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   offsite.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   Oh, I like that.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.920]   It's three-two-one.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.920]   It's great.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.920]   It's achieved with three-two-one backups.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.920]   That's very straightforward.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   So have you seen the "Fake Steve Jobs" campaign?
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   I'm not sure I want to endorse this.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.920]   He's trying to bring 18T to its knees in the secret.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.920]   FakeSteve.net, if you go there, he's calling it "Project
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.920]   Chokehold."
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   Operation Buzzkill.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.920]   Same thing.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   The goal is to -- no, Operation Chokehold is right.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.920]   Project Buzzkill is the guy who wrote in and said, "Hey, just
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   consider this the impact this is going to have on people who use
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.920]   18T cell phones kind of as a lifeline to the outside world."
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.920]   So Operation Chokehold, the goal is for everyone, and I'm not,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.920]   again, advocating this.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   In fact, I'd like you guys to want to give this airtime.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   You know, I almost don't want to give it airtime.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   I almost don't, but I thought about doing it on Twitter and I
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   decided not to, but here amongst a more seasoned,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   intelligent crowd, I think we can mention it and ask then why
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   it's such a bad idea.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   Scott, you will get the first dibs on this.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.920]   Although it's very -- and I know Alex, you want to do it because
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.920]   it's very tempting.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.920]   Here's what FakeSteve Jobs says, "If FakeSteve.net."
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.920]   By the way, it's Dan Lyons.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   Everybody knows that.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   On Friday, December 18th at noon Pacific, we will attempt to --
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.920]   sounds like, you know, a manifesto from the Kremlin.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.920]   We will attempt to overwhelm the AITNT data network and bring it
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   to its knees.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   The goal is to have every iPhone user as many as we can turn on a
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   data-intensive application and run that app for one solid hour.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   Apps include maybe Ustream, that kind of thing, watching us.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.920]   Send the message to AT&T where sick of their substandard network,
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.920]   sick of their abusive comments.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.920]   The idea is to create a digital flash mob.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.920]   We're calling it Operation Chokehold.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.920]   Join us and speak truth to power.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.920]   But then somebody wrote in.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.920]   And actually, to Dan's credit, he did publish the email.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.920]   And I think it's kind of -- well, he published it, making fun of it.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   But I think it's a good point.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   This guy says, "Look, my wife's quadriplegic, our AT&T cell phone,
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   is our only phone.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   If you bring it down for an hour, if you bring the network down,
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   it'll bring down the phone network as well."
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.920]   And it may choke more than just AT&T.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.920]   And I think that's a legitimate point.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.920]   Scott, is that -- what's your thought on this?
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.920]   I don't even know where to start with this moron.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.920]   Dan, the fake brain might be better.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.920]   I mean, if you don't like the service, here's a real simple solution.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   Get rid of your phone.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.920]   Don't use AT&T.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   But when you talk about trying to bring the network to its knees
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.920]   by hampering the service, the rest of us are paying for,
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.920]   I think you're an idiot.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.920]   I mean, there's, you know, this faux outrage that the Internet
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.920]   allows people to express over, you know, we got Darfur.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.920]   We got people dying of H1N1.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   We've got, you know, an AIDS crisis.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   We've got all these problems in the world.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   And this is what this guy wants to build a movement around.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   Come on.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   Just, you know, like AT&T service, get rid of the damn phone
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   and get something else.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.920]   Alex, you were rubbing your hands with Glee.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.920]   You want to do this?
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   I think it's a great -- it's a great test of the system.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.920]   Think of it that way.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   You know, it's a little bit of a fire sale.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.920]   But the -- it would be very interesting.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   I don't think that they're going to be able to take it down.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.920]   I don't think enough people are going to do it.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.920]   I don't think it's going to be that big of a deal.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.920]   If I was AT&T, I'd be paying a lot of attention to cell networks
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.920]   and figuring out, you know, what that has.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   I mean, they obviously have a problem.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.920]   I'm not -- you know, I'm not -- and I think that the biggest --
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   the best way for AT&T to solve their problem is to allow Apple
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.920]   to make the cones available to a lot of other -- spread out the --
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   spread the pain to other cell networks that would love to have an iPhone.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   You know, if they can't handle the iPhone traffic,
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   what they should do is allow Verizon and T-Mobile and everyone else
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   to have access to that traffic and let them feel the pain that the iPhones are creating.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   I think iPhones are absolutely creating.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.920]   I don't know if a network -- a single network can -- can simply support what's happening.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   It looks like Apple's going to sell, you know, 10 million units this quarter
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.920]   and they may do that every quarter, you know, and that's going to be --
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.920]   >> Here's an interesting -- not a number of them.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   >> I'll throw an interesting article into the mix.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.920]   Randall Strauss, San Jose State Business Professor,
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.920]   writing in the Sunday's New York Times, says, "AT&T takes the blame,
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.920]   but really it's the iPhone's fault."
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   He interviewed a number of people, including Roger Enner,
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   who's a senior vice president for telecommunications research at Nielsen.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.920]   Enner says, "The iPhones air interface.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.920]   Electronics in the phone that connected the cell towers have shortcomings
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.920]   that affect both voice and data."
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   He says, "AT&T doesn't publicly defend itself because it will not criticize Apple under any circumstances,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   but he believes it's really the iPhone's fault."
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.920]   >> Well, certainly the iPhone's fault in terms of demand,
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.920]   and I think Alex's idea is actually a good one,
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   if everybody remembers back to when I was involved in my iPhone manious stage,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   I was the first one to say, "Oh, no, AT&T. I'm no AT&T fan."
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   But I just don't see how this plan can help.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.920]   I mean, do you think this will make AT&T more responsive?
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   The fact that they got attacked --
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   >> You're essentially handing them their own sort and shield.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.920]   You're saying, "Well, of course the network went down.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.920]   We were victims of a malicious attack."
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   But don't worry, AT&T takes security very, very seriously,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.920]   and they were unable to bring the network down completely.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.920]   That's why I went number one in customer service,
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.920]   according to this public commission, and you can trust us forever more.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   >> Well, there's an independent company, Root Wireless,
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   which is in the Seattle area that offers software that people can put on their phone to test it.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.920]   They ran 4.7 million tests on smartphones for each of the four major carriers
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.920]   in seven metropolitan areas -- Chicago, Dallas, LA, New York, San Francisco, and Washington.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.920]   They said, "In every market we tested, AT&T had faster average download speeds
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:15.920]   and signal strength of 75% or better more frequently than did Verizon."
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.920]   >> Yeah, the fundamental problem here really is the way people want to access data.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.920]   It's just -- they just want to have it.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   I'm a recent convert to the iPhone, and I got my first one
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.920]   when my Verizon contract went out this summer,
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.920]   and the day I got it, my relationship to my computer and the Internet,
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.920]   and all of that changed.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.920]   And I started consuming a hell of a lot more of this data, and that's just the way it is.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.920]   >> We Apple users, iPhone users, love to use them.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.920]   And I think that's true for software, too.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   People say, "I'm not going to develop for the Mac market because it's too small of a market."
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.920]   And yet Mac -- I think Mac developers do very well because Mac users buy software,
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   they buy more software, they use it more thoroughly, they pay for shareware.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   >> What do you think about this leading to these stories we're hearing that AT&T
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.920]   is going to move to a tiered pricing based on actual usage?
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.920]   Have you heard those stories?
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.920]   >> I haven't, but I think that's not a bad idea.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.920]   It depends on what the pricing is.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.920]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.920]   >> I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.920]   >> I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   >> I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.920]   >> I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   >> I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.920]   >> I think that's probably the way they float it is a trial balloon to see what people like us
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.920]   and say about it.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.920]   But I don't think tearing is a bad idea.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   I don't like caps.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   If you tell me, look, if you want faster bandwidths or you want more bandwidth,
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.920]   you pay more.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.920]   I don't have a problem with that as long as the pricing is fair.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.920]   >> Yeah, right now it's 30 upon itself.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.920]   >> You can either.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:05.920]   >> Yeah, they're talking about going to 40 a month with 10, 20, 30, 40, you know,
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.920]   download range.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.920]   So I think they're floating a couple of different ideas.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   But I guarantee if they said to me, would you pay 60 a month to get, you know,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   pay as much speed or whatever, I'd be glad to pay it.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.920]   I think there are plenty of power users that would pay more to take some of the pressure
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.920]   off the network.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.920]   And I do think this is a legitimate line of inquiry and concern.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.920]   I mean, I think they could do something here that would either be very helpful or very
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.920]   hurtful to the rest of us and I'm going to watch it closely.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.920]   >> Now, Peter, when we were in Australia, I remember how expensive it is.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.920]   Johnny Worthington, who's one of our listeners who listens in Australia, is telling us that
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.920]   if you're on Telstra and you have a business account with Telstra, which is even, you know,
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   a better account, 150 megabytes of data on your phone, $10.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920]   Twice that.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.920]   >> 300 megabytes, $29, more than twice the cost, three times the cost.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.920]   >> Yeah, it's out.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.920]   bandwidth is expensive in a lot of parts of the world.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.920]   And, you know, in Africa, it's tremendously expensive.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   And while I think that those approaches are a great formula for stifling development in
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:15.920]   your country, there is some sense to, you know, charging people for what they actually do
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.920]   use.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   >> John Gruber, by the way, responds to the Mantle Strass article and is in a very aggressive
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   manner, perhaps justified, perhaps not.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   Claim one is that the source, his primary source is a printer of President of Global Wireless
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.820]   Solutions, a network testing firm that has AT&T as one of his clients for rising
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.820]   not one of his clients.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:48.460]   Root Wireless, the company I mentioned in Bellevue that does the software testing, says, and
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.000]   Strass says in the article that the software that they ran didn't run on iPhones because
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.240]   you can't do background processes, so they didn't test the network on iPhones.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.240]   But that would, in a way, lend credence to Strass's claim, which is that the iPhone is
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.080]   the problem, not the network.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.600]   And he does say, well, what about consumer?
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   >> It's the damn user that's the problem.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.580]   >> I frankly use it once to bandwidth, you know.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:15.300]   >> And he also raises the point to which our chatroom raises, which is if it is the iPhone,
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.220]   poorly designed iPhone, then why isn't it having problems all over the world?
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.460]   Although I have heard lots of complaints in England about the iPhone.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.620]   >> I'm always a fan of guessing it's a user error problem.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.460]   >> Because it's almost always a safe bet.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:34.140]   >> We have a saying in the photography business, 99% of all lenses are better than 98% of all
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.140]   photographers.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.140]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:41.960]   >> Well, and I think that the only concern that I have is that someone who bought an iPhone
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.600]   expecting to have unlimited service is that there's a couple things.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:53.080]   This is that I would expect to at least be able to go through my contract, at least until
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.200]   the end of the contract, without having this be enabled.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.360]   This is what I bought into.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.640]   And I know that I'd be pretty tweaked if they changed it in the middle of the contract.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.600]   They saw a new contract and say, this is the new rule.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.800]   >> They can't do it like that, Alex.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.700]   They will not be able to change that.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.840]   You'll have an option of either getting out of it or they won't have it apply to you until
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.700]   then more than likely they would test this on new buyers to start with.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   >> Right.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.680]   And then the second thing is, is that this gets into an argument against monopolies and
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.260]   so on and so forth that if AT&T is going to start charging, this is where I would want
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:34.460]   to see it either by their choice or by force that they have to make the iPhone available
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.540]   to other networks.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:41.420]   Because then we get to choose because if AT&T is the only one with the iPhone and they're
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:48.260]   able to just set whatever rates they're going to set from an iPhone user's perspective,
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.820]   I would find that to be concerning.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.300]   They'll charge whatever they're going to charge.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:58.620]   I want to at least see them have to compete with Verizon and T-Mobile and everyone else
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.420]   for our service.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:06.980]   I do think that iPhone users generally are more valuable in a lot of ways.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:12.580]   I get that we put a lot of pressure on it but we also pay pretty hefty rates for our
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.260]   service in general.
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.660]   We're not buying the bottom level service that AT&T is getting.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:23.420]   >> So the other question in all of this is what happens with Google and Android and other
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.860]   smartphones and does that put pressure on AT&T?
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:34.940]   Now part of the reason they have this need to maybe not be as responsive is because it's
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.700]   seen that there really isn't an option.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.260]   >> There's no choice.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.420]   >> One and it looks like I think they said there's going to be 50 phones, 50 Android
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.860]   phones coming out next year.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.660]   So I think that there is going to be a lot of companies.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.980]   >> Including Google phone if you believe some of the rumors.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:56.660]   >> Employees got something called a Nexus last week and everybody seemed to have one.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.940]   A lot of people have seen them now.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.940]   They're beautiful.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:05.340]   They kind of look like, well they look like an Android phone but big screen and HTC designed
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.940]   it for Google and there are some rumors.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:13.060]   I don't credit them by the way that Google is going to start selling these unlocked in
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.060]   January.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:19.220]   Now they'll be GSM which means AT&T or T-Mobile will be your two choices.
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.380]   >> Yeah, but there are a couple things that are missing from all these rumors.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.340]   Number one, what does this do that any other Android phone would not do?
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.340]   >> Well, it's a new version of Android that's available only on that phone.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.020]   >> That's all I'm about to say.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.580]   That's what I was about to say.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:37.220]   It's supposedly that it has Android 2.1 but I've never heard a rumor about people who've
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.380]   held and used these things.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.660]   It says, once if I've already bought a Droid and I update to version 2.1 of the OS, what
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.420]   will I have on this new phone that I would not have on any existing phone?
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:53.340]   It would be a big deal if a manufacturer decided to make a competitively priced unlocked phone.
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:57.460]   Right now a lot of people don't realize that it is very, very easy to buy an unlocked phone
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:02.340]   but usually that's when you start to find out exactly how much these devices actually
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.020]   cost when they're not being subsidized by a two-year contract.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:10.140]   Typically, you can expect to spend about $150 to $200 premium over the cost of a subsidized
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.140]   phone.
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.420]   So I'm not sure.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.020]   It's just rumor, rumor, rumor at this point but I'd be very curious to see if they could
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:24.140]   sell this phone for less than $4 or $500 and if given that most people don't tend to hopscotch
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.780]   between carriers all that often, if people are going to think that they're getting value
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:33.020]   for $200, if you live out the life of your contract on that phone and two years later
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.700]   you're still in the same carrier, you kind of spent $200 on nothing unless you were able
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.420]   to find exactly the carrier that you wanted.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.420]   Right.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.420]   Yeah, I'm not sure I credit it.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:49.780]   I think in all the likelihood it's just Google with another phone that they're trying at
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.100]   and as you say, everybody's going to be doing Android phones.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.900]   That's a real challenge really for Apple is the Android phone.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.900]   It's not one Google phone.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.900]   It's not one Google phone.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.900]   Exactly.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.900]   Exactly.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.020]   It's the Red Amped algorithm where no one of them is beginning to take down the elephant
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.940]   but you put 10,000 of them in the field and boy that guy's going to lose a foot or two.
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.580]   Well, here's the only question that I have though is someone who develops software is
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.340]   that what I get concerned about when I hear that there's going to be 50 different phones
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.820]   is that there's 50 different implementations of something that I have to develop for and
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.980]   that is not something that gets me excited.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:26.700]   I mean, as we're working on iPhone apps, we're working on stuff like that right now,
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.340]   I would not want to try to figure out how 50 different people are going to interact with
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.340]   my software.
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.660]   I heard from not even interested.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.660]   Two different developers said the same thing Alex.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.220]   They said the Google phone is the wild, wild west and they don't want to get involved.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.460]   Well, what about the Android marketplace?
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.860]   You have a place you can go to the Android marketplace where you're on all the phones.
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.140]   Yeah, but the thing is, if you look at the implementation, I mean, one of the things that
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:55.140]   we all kind of attacked Apple about was how tight they are on the apps and how they very
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:00.260]   slowly allowed apps to come on the phone and what you got was a stable platform the whole
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.260]   time.
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:06.340]   When you just say, "Okay, everybody ready set go and there's very few restrictions, somebody's
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.260]   going to get in there and crash that thing.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.980]   There's going to be all kinds of, like I say, 50 implementations.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.660]   Some features will work on this phone or not that phone."
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.540]   I think it's kind of a murky area.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.940]   I hope it succeeds to the degree that it keeps some pressure on Apple because I want to see
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.300]   my iPhone continue to improve.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.740]   I don't know, I'm not convinced yet.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.980]   I'm going to buy one and play with it and find out.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.780]   No matter where you live, there's some place your phone isn't going to work.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.780]   One of the arguments in the favor of Google having their own hardware is to have the level
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.860]   of control over the handset that Apple has over the iPhone where they would know exactly
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.940]   what the hardware loadout is also so that they could push a feature or push an update
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.540]   onto it and know exactly what that state is.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:53.460]   There are only a few, there aren't that many Android phones in the market right now, but
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:27:00.220]   even so, if you hand someone a really cool new Android phone and it's an HTC Hero, the
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:05.340]   guy who bought the G1 phone will say, "Wow, the new operating system has this wonderful
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.260]   application switcher and it has this really wonderful dashboard."
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.900]   And then you have to explain to them, "Well, no, that's just something that HTC adds
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.060]   to this specific model of phone."
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.740]   So there might be a benefit to having that going on.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.300]   Android marketplace is a great unifier, but I have three different Android devices in
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.540]   the house right now, and two of them can't use the standard marketplace because one of
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.540]   them has kind of an odd-shaped screen and they feel as though it's better to have one
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:32.220]   central marketplace for them where they know that everything has been checked out for
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.220]   this device.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.420]   So that's kind of like the Windows mobile world got and it really didn't work.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.020]   It was a really bad situation.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:42.260]   I think what Google is doing to agree with you, Andy, their goal is to make some sort
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.900]   of platform that's a reference platform.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:50.060]   They call it the Google experience and they will, I predict, they'll have Google experience
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:54.460]   phones of which this may be one, maybe they won't sell them.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.300]   Some companies will, they'll be certified, the full Google experience, they'll have more
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.060]   Google applications on it.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.900]   They'll be a certain minimum screen size, a certain configuration, minimum configuration.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.380]   If you want all of the Google experience, you'll buy that phone.
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.900]   If you're willing to get something like the Motorola Click, which is heavily customized,
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.900]   you'll get that phone.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.900]   I think that that appeases the carriers who really do want to customize.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.820]   That's how they can do value add.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:25.180]   If everybody has an Android, or rather a Android, a Motorola Droid, they all look the same.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.220]   Then it's down to the network.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.060]   You can see the fights that have evolved over that.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.060]   Well, that's Verizon.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.340]   You can have Verizon wins that one.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.340]   Who wins that?
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.660]   We already see some of that with, you know, some of these Android phones have powered by
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.740]   Google stickers on the back of it or somewhere on the branding.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.340]   That means that it has to contain a certain minimum level of compatibility with the platform,
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.940]   a certain minimum level of software that's provided and written by Google.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.540]   The ones that don't have that sticker, the ones that can go freestyle a little bit better.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.180]   I think that's where we're going.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.900]   Well, I think it'll pop the thing.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.900]   Go ahead, Scott.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.740]   Well, I'm just going to say that the folks on this show often worry about monopolies.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:12.260]   I mean, if Google's got my Gmail and my Docs and my calendar and my phone and, you know,
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.180]   they go belly up, then what do I do?
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.660]   That's the data that Google actually addresses that with something called a data liberation
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.660]   front.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.580]   If you go to data liberation front dot org, they have created and they are having a company
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:29.420]   wide initiative that lets you get your data out of anything that Google's done.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.580]   So we're dealing with mobs attacking the 18-10 network.
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.300]   We're doing liberation fronts on another platform.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.060]   Is this indeed Cuba 1951 that we're dealing with just by trying to get a damn dial tone
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.060]   in the phone?
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.180]   We just want to phone that works.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.180]   Please.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.220]   How about if we just buy the phones we like and keep buying them if we keep liking them
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.100]   and then just let's not buy guns.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.100]   How about we try that?
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.700]   Well, the question I have for those of you who have been playing with and Andy that you're
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:03.260]   playing with these different Android phones are do you feel like the fit and finishes
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.100]   as good as an iPhone?
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.100]   Often, oftentimes, yes.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.660]   They have to accommodate a lot of different hardware in order to make it work.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.780]   If I have any problems with the droid, it's that it has to do a lot of stuff just to accommodate
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.580]   that slide out keyboard.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:21.700]   But there is, you're right in that there is a lot of room in the bottom end to say that
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.420]   we need to be able to build this for X minimum number of dollars.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.380]   And you will see that in the form of case parts to sort of rattle around a bit, a battery
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:33.460]   cover that tends to pop off when you don't want to, which is IE anytime you do not want
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.460]   to get access to the battery.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.460]   Yeah, but try to get it off when you want access to the battery.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.060]   And it's hours to figure it out.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.140]   There's some secret button.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.180]   I know that we're going to talk more about Steve Jobs is in the running for person of
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.060]   the year again at Time Magazine.
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.140]   We'll give you so excited about that.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.140]   We're pulling for you, Steve.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.540]   We're calling it a number for you.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.540]   And Apple has an interesting plan.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:06.260]   And perhaps the tablet is part of that to undermine or own the ebook market.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.100]   We'll find out more about that in just a second.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.380]   I do want to talk a little bit about one of our sponsors, the great GoToMeeting from the
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.380]   folks at Citrix, G-O-T-O Meeting.com.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.660]   Makes your meetings easier.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.660]   You'll do more.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.020]   You'll travel less.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.060]   You don't have to be on a phone call.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.820]   It doesn't have any visuals, a boring old conference call.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.820]   You can see what you're talking about.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.260]   You can collaborate on documents together.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.780]   And you don't have to jump in your car to drive across town for a five-minute meeting
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.860]   or fly across a country for a one-hour meeting.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.860]   Who has the time?
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.860]   Who has the money?
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.140]   Hold those meetings right from your desk, as if you're in the room with the people you're
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.300]   meeting with.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.580]   And you could try it right now for 30 days, absolutely free, for sales presentations, for
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:52.220]   product demos, for training sessions, collaborating on documents, just $49 a month, $49 a month
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.980]   for all the meetings you want as long as you want.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.420]   That includes voiceover, the internet, and free teleconferencing.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.500]   And yet, we're giving that to you free for the next 30 days.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.180]   Go to GoToMeeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.780]   I do think you ought to try this if you are in business at all.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.900]   We use it all the time now.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.660]   And in fact, just to be an invaluable tool for Twit.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.020]   And we pay for our account, by the way.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.140]   It was just easier to do it.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.140]   Go to Meeting.
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.140]   It's affordable.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.140]   Go to Meeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.940]   We thank them so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:27.500]   All right, I think Steve Jobs now has 49% of the vote.
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.580]   I guess they're doing this online.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.140]   Regular text messaging rates apply.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.620]   Oh, yeah, you text message.
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.900]   It's like I was just talking.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.220]   I'm probably right.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.220]   American Idol.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.420]   It's American Idol.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.620]   This week's contestant, Mr. Steve Jobs.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.260]   Steve is now one of seven candidates remaining.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.900]   They look at the success of American Idol and they say, how can we make this the same?
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:54.860]   Yeah, there's like a two-hour show to reveal the winner after an hour and 50 minutes of
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:55.860]   information.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.340]   Interestingly enough, in the early nominees, a cumulative entry representing Iranian protesters,
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.420]   which I would have voted for.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.900]   That's no longer one of the top choices.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:13.980]   Another finalist, including the president, Barack Obama, Stanley McChrystal, runner Usain
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:21.940]   Bolt, speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi, chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, and the Chinese
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:22.940]   worker.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.940]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.940]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:31.380]   I nominate Leo LePort, creator of the first all day, anywhere, anytime video network talking
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.380]   about tech.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:36.140]   I'm not in the running and I don't think I particularly care to be in the running.
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.740]   Is this Time Magazine you're talking about?
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.740]   Time Magazine.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.220]   They've done this since 1927.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.500]   You remember Hitler was the person.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.380]   It doesn't have to be some people.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.060]   You were the person of the year.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.060]   Never.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.060]   Did you use the internet back then?
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.740]   They didn't use the internet for Hitler.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.300]   The personal computer was the person of the year once.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   I can't remember when.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.580]   Do you remember the year when it was you?
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.580]   You.
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.580]   That's right.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.580]   It was you.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.580]   I thought it was mylar.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.580]   That was pathetic.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.580]   You.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:04.580]   It was you.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.580]   That was like we really can't pick anything.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.860]   You are all the person, the collective person of the year.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.420]   Shilling for subscribers.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.500]   They're going to decide by tomorrow.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.380]   I'm really hoping that it's the Chinese worker because they're probably the ones who are
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.980]   going to have to assemble the award statue anyway.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.700]   It'll feel, it'll make them feel involved.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.980]   Oh, and you're right.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.580]   Be sure to watch Today's Show Wednesday, December 16th for the exclusive announcement
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.780]   of Time's Person of the Year.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.100]   You're absolutely right.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.300]   You know, there's just not an original thought anywhere in control of the television station
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.180]   or a new magazine these days.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.180]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.620]   I hope it's Kathy Lee who hands Steve Jobs the award.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.620]   That would be people.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.620]   Wow.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.940]   I just love your computer.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.420]   So as in Jobs one before, am I wrong?
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.420]   I don't know.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.340]   Oh, they should have some reason.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.420]   I think I know the computer and you.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:58.220]   Can you imagine the Windows fan boys head spinning around on their neck upon hearing that
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.220]   accomplishment?
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.420]   Why should Steve Jobs be the person of the year 2009?
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.580]   I don't quite get that this year.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.340]   What did he do this year that made him so?
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.340]   He survived.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.180]   Everyone was afraid that he was going to survive.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.180]   I just don't.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.900]   And everyone was worried.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.900]   I don't see.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.900]   Let me just let me see here.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   Here it is.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.900]   Of course, who would have that list?
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.900]   Wikipedia.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.740]   So Barack Obama was the person of the year last year.
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.700]   So he's in the running again two years and running.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.500]   Vladimir Putin 2006 was the year of you.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:35.060]   2005 was the Good Samaritans Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Bono.
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.860]   George Bush won twice in 2000 and 2004.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.180]   The American soldier won in 2003.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.540]   The whistle blowers in 2002.
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.260]   Rudolph Giuliani in 2001.
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.900]   Jeff Bezos in 1999.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.060]   I don't see that's interesting that Bezos would have won in 1999.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.700]   Now, it doesn't look like Steve Jobs has ever won before.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.700]   The computer won in 1982.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.420]   How about Tiger Woods?
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.900]   He was in the running, but now not so much.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.900]   Not so much.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.860]   Again, does not have to be for doing good.
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.140]   Just for doing.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.460]   And I think he did a lot of doing.
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.500]   He's got a finger on the pulse.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.140]   He's got a finger everywhere.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   We've caught up.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.140]   Here we go.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:24.540]   Ladies and gentlemen, don't I don't know what you see for the following content.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:29.820]   We can pull the wire from the battery right now before the bomb reaches singularity.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.820]   Okay.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.860]   All we'll have is a pool of warm perchium.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.700]   We will not have a strain reaction.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   That's right.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:42.060]   We'll be telling stories for our grandkids about the smart, smart thing we just did.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.420]   Apple did win.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.420]   We did it.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.420]   We just did it.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.420]   It's because done, it's over its history.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.420]   It's gone.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.100]   It's erased from the minds of all.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:56.620]   Apple did win a number of awards in ad weeks best of the 2000s advertising awards.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.820]   The marketer of the decade.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.020]   Steve Jobs, right?
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.900]   Calling Jobs visionary, iconic plastic.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.900]   I'm a classic.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.900]   Fearless.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.900]   Yes.
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.900]   I think you'd have to give him credit for that.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.300]   Brand of the decade.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.300]   Apple.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   Product of the decade.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.300]   iPod.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.340]   Campaign of the decade.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.340]   Get a Mac.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.340]   Is that get a Mac?
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.780]   Is that I'm a Mac?
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.780]   What is get a Mac?
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.780]   Yeah, that's the I'm a Mac.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:27.780]   I'm a Mac is get a Mac.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.700]   By the way, PC is going to join us for a special holiday show.
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.700]   We do this every year.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.300]   Well, second year running.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.900]   John Hodgman and Jonathan Colton will join us on Thursday at 4 p.m.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:43.020]   Pacific 7 p.m. eastern for a special holiday twit this Thursday.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.980]   But I think I'm not allowed to ask him about those.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.780]   He talked about the last year.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:51.820]   He talked about some funny things like the one where he comes out of the floor.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.060]   He's done some interesting things.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.060]   Campaign of the decade.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.540]   Get a Mac out of the out of home.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.540]   Out of the decade.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.900]   I guess that means like billboards, right?
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.860]   Those I grade iPod silhouette ads.
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.860]   Definitely, right?
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.380]   Digital campaign of the decade.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.660]   The Nike plus.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.460]   So that's Apple.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.460]   Too much sweeping ad weeks best of the 2000 awards.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:22.220]   That's about 2009.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.940]   What would you give the best out of 2009?
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.740]   Do they have one for 2009 or is it just all of the 2000s?
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.740]   Yes.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.740]   This is for the decade.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.740]   Oh, okay.
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.740]   For the day.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:33.740]   This is the 2000s.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.260]   But I'm sure they'll do one for the year, right?
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.260]   Maybe not.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.260]   I think so.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.900]   I mean, not so the rumor now.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.900]   God, these rumors.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.780]   You can't keep up with these rumors.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.140]   New rumor.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.940]   The I tablet.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.540]   What are we calling it?
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.540]   The iPad.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.540]   The I tablet.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.300]   Yeah, I think it's the rumored Apple tablet.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.180]   At this point, it's such a mental macro that you'd only confused me by asking me to call
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.620]   it anything else.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.980]   The rumor is if you call it the iPad, then it can just change one leg of all of his
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.980]   books.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.460]   Yeah, but there, but somebody else has that.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.660]   Back out on the market.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.660]   Somebody else has that.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.660]   Oh, well, you know, you know, you know, Apple.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.980]   Someone else had the iPhone too.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.460]   With Apple said, no, we have it.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:14.460]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.460]   Yeah, but a lot of paper says we have it.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.460]   No, no, that's ours.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:22.060]   Information Week says the Apple tablet will come out in March with a very interesting
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:26.260]   strategy designed to own the ebook marketplace.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.260]   Ooh.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.260]   Mm.
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:32.420]   I don't think anything can own the book marketplace that costs more than 300 bucks.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.540]   It'll definitely transform the ebook marketplace.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.580]   It'll set the standard for how the relationship that the hardware developer will have with
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.580]   a publisher.
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:40.580]   And that's it.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:45.100]   But and it, but then the amount of excitement that is going to generate just for e-publishing
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.100]   in general is already, it's just, it's just phenomenal.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:54.200]   When I wrote my piece about the, I cannot, I cannot name the Crunchpad by its new name
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.860]   because I don't want to encourage them.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.500]   But the, when I did my piece about the Crunchpad last week, it's probably going to, you know,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.340]   flare out and die pretty quickly.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:06.540]   But it really does show that every single manufacturer of anything that's even remotely
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.900]   tablet like that I've ever talked to is just preparing for what happens after, after Apple
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.140]   releases the tablet.
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.900]   I compare it, I compared it to like the year before there's a world war where no, it's
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:17.900]   not, hasn't been announced.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.220]   No, it hasn't been scheduled, but everybody's anticipating that the world is to be fundamentally
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.980]   different this time next year.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.900]   And they're making arrangements to make sure that they're in the best position to survive
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.100]   and thrive in that new landscape.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:34.340]   Especially when you talk about talk to publishers, everybody has a concrete plan for how they're
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:38.220]   going to deal with the fact that there's going to be these really cool, inexpensive color
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.460]   touchscreen tablets to publish things onto it is one of the most, 2010 is going to be
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.580]   one of the most exciting years in technology period.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:48.060]   I think we'll look back on it and just, that'll be one of those little things we put a little
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:52.020]   red pushpin and saying that's one of those years where everything changed after that.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:55.340]   Well, it'd be as big as the iPhone, Andy.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:58.660]   I think it will be big as the iPhone, but for different reasons.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.740]   It's not just going to work.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:04.020]   The iPhone was a success because of the iPhone and it created an iPhone universe.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.100]   If you're inside the iPhone universe, you benefit from that.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:11.220]   And there's little tangential benefits to other people who want to buy smartphones, but
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.220]   chiefly that's it.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:17.500]   I think that the tablet is going to be a really phenomenally cool device, but it's also going
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.420]   to create the environment in which every single magazine, newspaper and book publisher is going
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:27.140]   to be that much more compelled to say we're going to have a comprehensive digital publishing
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.140]   plan.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:31.700]   It's not going to be something that some guy who was a failed vice president who would
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.940]   never make it further in the company.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.100]   Well, we'll give them the digital publishing division because that's not really very big.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.700]   It's not going anywhere.
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.980]   Everybody has a horse in that race and everybody flees that that's an opportunity to make lots
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:43.980]   and lots of money.
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.420]   It will create the environment in which everybody starts thinking about publishing everything
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.860]   digitally from now on.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.420]   Cool.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:59.620]   I think that it is a big thing is it shows you the advantage of being a hardware developer.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:05.660]   People don't care about selling the content.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:09.340]   Obviously, they want to sell the content, but they're there to sell the hardware.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.980]   The big distinction is that you end up in this situation where Amazon is trying to make
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.340]   money selling the content.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:22.180]   Apple can give publishers an entirely different deal because they just need to cover the costs.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.460]   That's an entirely different structure.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.940]   It makes it very hard.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.460]   Amazon has some advantage.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:32.660]   They have a hardware device, but that hardware device is going to pale in comparison to being
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:37.380]   able to see color and have video and have the multimedia and have the interactivity.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:41.780]   I think that the LP stuff that we're seeing in iTunes is a precursor.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.580]   I hope it's a precursor to the kind of stuff we're going to start seeing available for this
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.020]   is that is the package.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:52.900]   What I'm hoping is is Apple is going to use that same package and simply extend it with
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:53.900]   what we're doing.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.380]   Well, the big deal is not just the tablet, but the deal that they're probably going to
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.500]   offer to publishers.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.860]   Every publisher I've talked to is also not terribly happy with the deal they have with
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.420]   Amazon.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:08.580]   If you have a book that you want to publish through Amazon Kindle, Amazon will consider
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.740]   you to be their partner in the endeavor and they will expect to be paid like a partner,
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:17.980]   whereas Apple and other distributors want to be paid like a distributor saying, "We
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.420]   want to win our beaks on this.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.180]   We certainly want to taste it every sale, but this is your book.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:26.780]   You're here to make money off of your property.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:31.540]   We're just here to take a cut off of the transactions that you create."
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.820]   It's time and time again, whether it's again a newspaper, a magazine or a book publisher,
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:40.100]   they're all not terribly happy with the deals they're getting from Amazon and they are thrilled
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.980]   with the prospect of being able to make deals with anybody else and start to get more favorable
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:45.980]   terms.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.900]   It looks like Apple and every other distributor is going to offer much better terms than Amazon.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:54.060]   That's where Amazon is weak, not with the hardware, but with the business deals.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:44:00.580]   This speculation comes from Yair Reiner, who was an Oppenheimer analyst, quoted supply
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:05.500]   chain contacts saying Apple appears to be preparing production of as many as a million
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.020]   units a month.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.140]   He believes that assuming there are no production problems, they would have the inventory it
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.020]   needs to launch in March or April.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:20.820]   He also said that it would be an iPhone-style LCD display, not an OLED display, which is
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.820]   kind of surprising.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.340]   Apple will offer e-bick publishers a 30/70 split Apple.
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:37.180]   Much like they do with iTunes, Apple gets 30, 70 goes to the publishers, and no exclusivity,
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:43.580]   which is significantly more than a book publisher gets in a bookstore.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.180]   He says Amazon offers, but Amazon demands exclusivity.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:54.220]   Have you guys taken a look at that Sports Illustrated tablet demo that's been out there for a couple
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.220]   of weeks?
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.260]   Tell us about it.
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:04.060]   The magazine world has been trying to figure out how to port magazines to electronic distribution
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.780]   for a long time.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:15.140]   The websites we see now are the result, and they're not particularly compelling or different.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.420]   Time Warner, I don't know whether it would be successful or not, but it does appear to
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:24.820]   be thinking differently and thinking in a more of a convergence manner, where they have
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:34.580]   taken the editorial, the good parts of the editorial infrastructure to put it together
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.580]   into a tablet delivered device.
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:45.020]   You can get this on YouTube or Vimeo, just Google Sports Illustrated tablet demo.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:51.100]   There's a bunch of fluff in there as well, but it's an interesting new approach to the
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:59.860]   idea of what is screen delivery offer you that augments what could be in a magazine,
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:06.260]   and yet how do you make some kind of a compelling presentation all put together in one package?
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.260]   The part that I wonder about is-
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.260]   This is the one that was shot on the red camera, right?
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:10.260]   Is that right?
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.100]   No shot this whole thing on?
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:19.300]   Well, I think I'm not sure that's the issue as much as it is that it's just repurposing
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:28.540]   of magazine and really kind of television kind of content into a tablet driven, touchscreen
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.500]   driven electronic delivery format.
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.500]   The interesting part is that-
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:42.980]   The thing is, all I was going to say is that we saw this when we went from analog
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:48.900]   to digital and photography is that for a while the digital will be behind.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:53.100]   It won't look as pretty, it won't do quite as much, it won't be the same resolution,
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:58.140]   but there's a point in time where what you get out of it just simply makes the analog
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.140]   seem silly.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:02.140]   We got to that point.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:06.140]   No, it makes it feel dirty and expensive.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.500]   Dirty and particular.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.660]   Not talking about Tiger Woods.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.660]   Oh, you did it, you see?
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.820]   You brought it right around.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:24.580]   But the interesting thing is we're seeing in the professional photography world that
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:29.660]   more and more of us are finding that we're shooting only for electronic distribution
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.980]   rather than paper distribution these days.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:39.420]   And that really is something that's the story of 2009 from our perspective in the photo
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:45.580]   world is that this rumored change to electronic publishing really hit this year.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:52.180]   And it's maybe Time Warner will make it with this thing, but it's a lot of overhead.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.900]   Those guys are carrying around too.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.100]   So not going to be an easy switch.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.260]   One of the things that I think is interesting also, all I was going to say is that I think
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.500]   that's interesting to see what's going on with this.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:06.940]   I think the LP stuff that we're seeing in iTunes mixed with the new extended video stuff
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:13.020]   for basically the DVD experience that we're seeing along with possibly this publishing
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:17.180]   is really, when I saw the extended DVDs, I was like, "Well, I don't have any reason."
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.660]   Once they start actually publishing these, I don't have any reason to buy DVDs anymore.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.140]   The only reason I buy them is for the extras.
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:30.180]   And so I think that all of these things just continue to push iTunes into the center of
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.180]   all of this stuff.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.580]   We're going to take a break, come back, talk more about the Mac.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.300]   So I hope you're picks of the week too.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:47.340]   Peter Kroger is with us the author of the damn book at dthedambook.com.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.900]   The really the book to read if you're looking at the digital asset management, how it's
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.940]   to do with your digital photography.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:49:00.580]   Also working, it's really cool with the Library of Congress on a way of preserving digital
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.700]   content, dpbestflow.org.
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:04.700]   Scott Bornback.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.420]   Good to see you again, Scott.
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.420]   Welcome.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.500]   Andy Inaco from the Celestial Waste of Banwith in Chicago, sometimes, and of course, Alex
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:16.220]   Lindsey on Skype this week because he's in Pittsburgh visiting family.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.580]   Before I go farther, though, I should probably mention our friends at Ford and the great
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.580]   Ford Sync.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.180]   We're talking now about bringing a Ford Flex.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:28.140]   That was the one you were looking at, Scott, down to CES and showing everybody how Sync
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.140]   works.
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.420]   You really have to try it to understand what a--
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.740]   I spent all weekend driving forage trying it.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:34.740]   Did you?
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.740]   What'd you think?
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.380]   I synced myself up like you would not believe.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.900]   And you liked it?
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.580]   I think Sync is really cool.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.260]   I just wish it was available on a little larger car for horizontal--
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.180]   I thought you were going to get a Lincoln.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.180]   It's on the Lincoln.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.700]   The Lincoln is tiny.
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.700]   It is?
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.700]   I drove the MKS.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:53.260]   I was really close to thinking I could buy it, looking at the specs.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.260]   And I sat in it.
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.860]   It's about the size of a VW Beetle.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.180]   Fortunately, we're not all Scott's size.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.180]   That's true.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.100]   They don't design cars for me.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.100]   They designed it for Alex.
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.100]   I got that big--
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.900]   Oh, I love my Mustang.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.900]   It's very comfortable.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:10.300]   Anyway, the Ford Sync is the hands-free system that not only does your Bluetooth phone, but
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:14.820]   also is for your music, for information with serious travel link, you get five-day weather
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:20.180]   forecast, ski reports, movie times, fuel prices, all without taking your eye off the
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.820]   road or your hands off the wheel.
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:26.260]   You press the Sync button, you tell your car what you want to know, and it talks to you.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.220]   It tells you back temperature.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.220]   72.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.220]   It's so cool.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.220]   Isn't that cool to do that?
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.820]   I just kept doing it over and over.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.300]   Climate temperature 73.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.460]   No, wait a minute.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.940]   Climate temperature 72 again.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:42.940]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:43.940]   I have to say.
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.060]   It's a lot of fun to play with it.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:47.780]   So we want everybody to give it a try.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.900]   Best way to do it, go to your Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.340]   But if you're going to be in Vegas at CES, come by.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.580]   We're going to drive the Mustang down.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.700]   We'll also have a Ford-- I believe have a Ford Flex that you can play with and take a look
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.700]   at.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.700]   It is just amazing.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.860]   Go to SyncMyRidepodcast.com and look at the site there.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:07.940]   It'll bring you over to SyncMyRide.com, which is the site for Sync owners.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.460]   They can get software updates there.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:11.140]   They can get vehicle history reports.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.140]   It actually will send your vehicle health to the website so you can look at your vehicle
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.940]   health.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:20.740]   It's just the next generation of electronics in your automobile.
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:21.740]   Really remarkable.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.780]   Yes, every car should have it.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.580]   Ford Lincoln and Mercury is the only cars that have it right now.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.860]   Not to mention the safety features.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.860]   Let's take a look.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.820]   SyncMyRidepodcast.com.
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:35.180]   You never had a better computer friend, a little computer buddy in your car.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.500]   SyncLady just talks to me.
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.380]   I just love her.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:43.980]   Ford Sync SyncMyRidepodcast.com.
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.980]   Let's see here.
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.460]   Other stories in the nudes today.
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.660]   Oh, here we go.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:51.660]   There we go.
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.260]   This is not a Tigerwood story.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.580]   Don't get your hopes up.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.980]   I actually probably helped the ratings a little bit.
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:05.820]   Any site, PConline.com.cn via HardMac, leaking details about the upcoming Gulftown.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:10.780]   It's that six core processor that Intel's releasing and probably will be in the Mac
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.580]   Pro just in time to make Scott Morn jealous.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:16.260]   I would just buy another one.
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.140]   Just the Core i9 six core processor.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.740]   There is a slide and it doesn't look like a fake slide.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.100]   It looks exactly like the kind of slides that Intel.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.300]   Are we going backwards?
[00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.540]   We already got eight core.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.540]   Why do we want six?
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.540]   I want 16.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:37.340]   No, you have four cores each with two threads.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.340]   That's eight.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.540]   This is six cores each with two threads.
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.900]   It's really 12.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:49.940]   A single processor Mac Pro could have 12 processor threads and 24 logical cores.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:50.940]   Actually, 12.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:53.180]   Let me get my math right.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:57.260]   A single chip Mac Pro would have 12 threads.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.700]   A dual chip Mac Pro would have 24 threads.
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.220]   3.3 gigahertz looking at March 2010 time frame.
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:11.620]   If you're in the market for a Mac Pro, it looks like a reasonable time would be this
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:14.740]   spring Gulftown should.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:15.740]   32 nanometers.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.820]   It's amazing what they're doing with this stuff.
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:23.220]   The QPI, which is a really interesting way that Intel is using of connecting these processors
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:25.260]   together so they can work together.
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:29.500]   Hyperthreaded I9, some people are calling it.
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:32.820]   Just thought I'd pass that along since Scott just bought a Mac Pro.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.820]   I can't wait.
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:35.820]   You know what?
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.820]   Here's the thing.
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:41.940]   The great thing about buying a Mac Pro when you do it to write it off is you can buy another
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.020]   one next year to write it off.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.020]   You get one every year.
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.820]   Whether you need it or not.
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:54.620]   Chrome for Mac and Linux.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.700]   Ouch now, which means Chrome's available on Windows Mac and Linux.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:03.700]   Now the Google browser is ahead of Safari in the number three spot according to Net Applications
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:09.300]   which tracks the browser habits of 160 million unique visitors each month to 40,000 sites.
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.140]   Chrome's market share 4.4%.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.820]   I'm just not that impressed.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.980]   Safari only 4.37%.
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.940]   It doesn't display some sites properly for me and it certainly doesn't feel any faster.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.220]   I think you're right on that.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.100]   I don't think it's that much faster than WebKit.
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.100]   Certainly.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.020]   I think it's probably about the same same speed as WebKit.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:33.100]   What I'm really looking for is I want to see good evidence that it becomes more stable
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:38.820]   and more safe to use when you're working with sites with dodgy flash and dodgy plugins
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.980]   than anything else.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:43.740]   Feature wise, it just can't compare to Firefox or Safari.
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:48.300]   But if it will help my entire Mac, it runs more safely, more smoothly and faster.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:49.300]   I'm all forward.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:53.660]   But I haven't really seen really great evidence of that so far.
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:54.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:59.460]   I'm still using Safari and Firefox because of the extensions.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.900]   Firefox is the slugger though now, right?
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.700]   I mean, it's really by far the slowest.
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.100]   What do you use, Peter, for your browser?
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.260]   I'm a Safari and Firefox guy mostly.
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:12.860]   Now that Chrome on Windows has extensions and a lot of the extensions that I like and
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:17.180]   use are now available on Chrome on Windows, not on the Mac, unfortunately.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.180]   But it's making it much easier.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:22.220]   Why not give up on Camino because they updated it and upgraded it to the point where now
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.220]   it doesn't work?
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.220]   Oh, no.
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.220]   It doesn't work out.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.220]   It doesn't work for you?
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:32.140]   It worked great for me before, but now it doesn't see stuff that it used to see.
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:34.900]   It used to be really good about using.
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:40.300]   I would use it because when I went to a Windows-based site that I couldn't see so well in Safari,
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:46.740]   Camino would always render it pretty faithfully, but they upgraded to version 2.01 from actually
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:50.460]   what upgraded to version 2 and then now 2.01.
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.180]   There's whole parts of pages I can't see, for instance, on Bitly.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.060]   I can't see the updates.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:58.620]   They don't show.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.620]   That's not good.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.260]   No, that's because that's an extension.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.660]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.420]   But it used to work before they updated it.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:08.740]   So now I'm using Safari almost exclusively.
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:12.340]   There is on the Mac OS X hints our chat room has just told me Stephen Bee just passed along.
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:17.260]   There is a article on how to enable extensions in Chrome on the Mac.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:23.660]   Boy, that's, I mean, now you're really, now you're hacking.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:31.340]   You have to launch it from the command line using an enable extensions command line argument.
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:33.340]   I'd say wait.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.340]   Nice.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.340]   Nice.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:40.820]   Or step one, download Firefox, step two, download plugins for Firefox.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:42.540]   So I bought a 27-inch iMac.
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:43.700]   Didn't have any problems with it.
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.700]   It's running great.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:50.260]   It's in the school and they're using it to do, you would logic to do podcast recording,
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.260]   editing and all that stuff.
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:52.260]   It's running great.
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:58.140]   But apparently it is the most problem played Mac in a long time.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.980]   Harkens back to the early days of the Mac book.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:07.420]   A lot of them coming a DOA damaged, displays are flickering or distorted.
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:13.900]   And in fact, Apple says we're delaying shipments of 27-inch iMacs by two weeks.
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.220]   Could be because of strong sales.
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:22.500]   Could be because they want to fix this figure out what's going on and fix this problem.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.340]   Apple asked for a comment.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:28.260]   I'm quoting all things digital.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:29.860]   All things D.
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:33.500]   So the new iMac has been a huge hit and we are working hard to fulfill orders as quickly
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:34.500]   as possible.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:39.260]   We apologize for any inconvenience or delay and delivery this might cause to our customers.
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:44.260]   He didn't say the spokesperson did not say if it had to do with the issues of the machine.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:49.980]   This is sort of like 1984 when they reduced the chocolate ration but said we're increasing
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.300]   it to a quarter ounce.
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:58.060]   Did you really expect him to add because we're having trouble building it at the end of that
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:59.060]   statement?
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:05.140]   I wondered if it was the box because that thing when it came, it's big and it's in a box.
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:09.780]   It's the usual Apple packaging where they have the Styrofoam ears.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.700]   But I could see how it's so big that it could get torqued a little bit.
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.060]   I could see how you could have problems in delivery.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:20.220]   Well I wonder if it's a different type of box than the 30-inch because the 30-inch has
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.180]   a big box but it really comes in more of a computer box where it's not eakers I don't
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.180]   believe.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:30.540]   Correctly the 30 inches that we've gotten have kind of they're totally encased in Styrofoam
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:34.540]   and it might have been in that change in packaging that caused some trouble.
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:39.380]   It's cheaper I'm sure to do the packaging in a way but I think that might be one of the
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:41.660]   challenges.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:45.060]   Any other stories before we get to our picks of the week?
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:48.540]   iPhone 3.13 coming soon.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.220]   OS 4.0 discovered according to Boy Genius Report.
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.220]   These are in the logs.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:57.140]   If you're at Apple you might want to think twice about surfing to Boy Genius Report with
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:01.940]   your new iPhone unreleased because they check that stuff.
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.780]   Let's stay away from the rumor sites.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:10.140]   Did you see the poor woman who had her Mac shot by the Israeli company?
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:11.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:12.140]   Holy cow.
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.140]   What happened?
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:14.140]   I only saw the picture.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.140]   I didn't.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.660]   Why did it get shot?
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:21.140]   So evidently it's one of those things like you're probably doing things that you should.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.100]   As someone who goes to some of these countries you don't want to have.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:28.100]   Usually people don't feel necessary to shoot the computer.
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:29.100]   Yeah.
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:36.020]   Well she had I guess some kind of Arabic sticker on her keyboard in Israel which is not usually
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:39.380]   a good thing and a variety of other things.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:43.860]   She got brought into questioning and while she was in question she said put your stuff
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:49.100]   over here and then someone took her laptop out evidently and decided that it was a bomb
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.100]   threat or something like that.
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.100]   Oh yeah.
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.860]   That's what I would do with a bomb shoot it.
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:57.300]   First thing I would do just shoot right at that bomb.
[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:02.100]   So they put three rounds in it and fortunately for her this gets back into the digital.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.140]   I was thinking about this when we were talking about backing up your files because she said
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:08.460]   her years of her of her life are on this laptop.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:14.740]   I was like you're crazy to be traveling to anywhere especially places that are less secure
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:20.420]   to be having to have everything that you actually, you know years of your life on one
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.020]   hard drive but they missed the hard drive and evidently she was able to get her stuff
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.020]   back.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.020]   That's the amazing thing.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.020]   The hard drive survived.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.500]   Well it didn't go through it.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.580]   If it had gone through it that she would have had to maybe send it to drive savers to see
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.580]   it.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580]   Yeah it would have been gone.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:37.660]   If you shoot a bullet through a hard drive generally it's been my experience.
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:41.460]   Yeah the point that survived when it make for a great ad.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.460]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:45.460]   Yeah I survived 45 caliber rounds.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:49.780]   Yeah was it was it was a nine millimeter or 45 because we have a rig to recover from
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.780]   nine millimeter.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.580]   We only have an experimental process for 45 caliber.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.580]   Look at the sound.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.580]   Look at those holes.
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.660]   That looks like bigger than nine millimeter.
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.460]   That's all I answered.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:00.780]   That's that's yeah that's big holes.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.060]   It was a large rack for sure.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:06.500]   It's like a rocket launcher for crying out what the hell did they use?
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.180]   I'm just all I'm saying is that you're not going to reboot after that.
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.980]   Oh wait a minute now that it's amazing.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:17.740]   Oh I see the hard drives in the upper right hand corner I guess and so yeah and so they
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:25.380]   shot three bullets it looks like through the lid goes through the the glass into the keyboard.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.820]   Wow all I'm going to say is out.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:29.820]   That's got to go back up.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:36.060]   You should see the photo of the guy who wore the the the Yankee ball cap with the Yankee
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:41.740]   stickers that actually brought his laptop to the Red Sox stadium.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.660]   That hard drive did not survive.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:48.140]   Oh no that hard drive just didn't make it.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:52.340]   Where is there any news on that up there Randy and Boston did they put that one on the news
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.460]   or was it too too gruesome.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:01.820]   Not really we're again we're mainly concerned with freezing a death up here.
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:05.540]   No you're not going to freeze to death tonight.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:10.540]   You might freeze to get tomorrow again with the the soil is is soft enough that we can
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.500]   get the bodies in not the full six feet but a good two and a half three feet enough that
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.500]   the wolves won't get them.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.460]   Don't get Graham until February or March is the latest.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.700]   That's all you can help for.
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.820]   You know that's you just you do the best you can.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:22.820]   That's all you can do.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.060]   What is iTunes connect?
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:29.100]   It's the Apple appears.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.180]   This is a story from nine to five Mac came out today.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:37.340]   Apple appears to be overhauling the infrastructure behind the iTunes app store confirming that
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:41.460]   iTunes connect the portal used by those who choose to make apps available through the
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.900]   Apple service is to be out of action through the Christmas period.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:50.860]   Oh no that's not they're not in first that's not infrastructure.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.820]   They don't want to have to review apps.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.500]   They're going to they're trying to catch up.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.460]   iTunes connect provides access to tools and resources developers need for the distribution
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.380]   of iPhone and iPod touch applications through the app store including application delivery.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:11.340]   Oh application management tools sales information banking set up and financial reports unavailable
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:15.740]   December 23 through December 28 from the Department of bed.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:22.100]   Tony no kidding that's going to hurt two days before Christmas through through Christmas
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:28.700]   in the few days after so people who want to give give away an app for Christmas no give
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:33.580]   an iPhone and you could be but that's crazy does that mean we won't be able to install.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:38.540]   So the person who made that decision I have a simple question did your parents have any
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.820]   children who lived.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:44.620]   Wait a minute let me think about that.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.100]   I can't think about that.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.940]   Let's take a look at some real reasoning behind that.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:52.820]   Well they you know when are you going to do it if you're going to if you're going to update
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:59.860]   not a busy is couple of shopping days in the world five days to you.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:04.980]   It's not an arbitrary it's not an arbitrary choice like okay why not after New Year's
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.540]   when everybody's drunk.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:11.540]   Yeah so does it does this mean you can't buy an app.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:14.980]   No sounds like it to me or can't you can't upload.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.740]   You can't submit it.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.740]   You can't you can't you can't you can't you can't exactly.
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.740]   Right.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.300]   I'm guessing I think it's a way to make sure the developer community spends the holidays
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.500]   with their families and their children their month.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:27.340]   They should be spending Christmas Eve assembling bicycles for their youngest daughter not a
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:31.660]   new fart app for the education of iPhone users exactly.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.620]   That's us every friend they're thinking about us.
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:39.300]   Exactly Apple there are daddy there are mommy.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.060]   That's very funny.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:45.500]   Give us anything good for 25th we're getting socks and underwear as usual but sometimes

[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:45.060]   where I want to that's how I like to listen to a book.
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:49.820]   They just released Alice Walker's the color purple for the first time in audio.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:56.220]   A Christmas Carol with Tim Curry that's actually free get that for free if you're an audible
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:00.980]   customer what is your pick Andy and I go you always have such great books to read.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:06.580]   Well I'm I'm a little bit stuck in a rut after since our trip to China over the summer I've
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.980]   been sort of doing all the reading that I probably should have done before.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:12.180]   Are you learning about China now?
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:16.420]   I've been I've been reading a lot of books about China and the one that's been cut that
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:20.580]   caught my eye the most recently is just a cool travel book no matter what the subject
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:26.500]   by Jay Martin Trus he has one of those really great Dutch names called lost on planet China.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:31.820]   I have I've it's been a while since I've given you the the the the the box the box score it
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:36.100]   is ten hours and fifty two minutes so you're definitely getting value for money but it's
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:40.340]   a series of travel essays about his trips through China.
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:45.420]   So the the really great travel books I they're not the ones that will tell that will that
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:51.060]   will convince you that well and the the effects of the opium wars the mid eighteen hundred
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:55.100]   were to both open up with ports to foreign it's it's more like okay well here's what
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:57.020]   it here's what it was like to eat snake.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.180]   Here's this guy here's a taxi driver that I ran into and Shanghai.
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:05.220]   You really want the the best slide show that anybody could ever give you about their really
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:09.380]   awesome trip to this place that you were hoped to go to someday but probably never will.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:14.620]   So it's always about humor it's always about being entertaining but the parts of it that
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.980]   I've read so far it's been oh this is going to be cool.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:22.620]   It's also of that category of books where you don't have to really immerse yourself in
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:27.260]   it you don't really have to commit to getting from page one to the last page in in in one
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.540]   week your life.
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:33.020]   It's very episodic in nature so you can just take a chunk and just read that just listen
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:37.620]   to that for the first hour take another chunk for another little bit of a trip and if you
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.860]   spend two weeks not listening to it that's fine because there's going to be another episode
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.460]   waiting for you as soon as you get back.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:47.140]   So I'm not sure if I understand anything about China that I did not understand before
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:52.660]   reading the first three four chapters of this but I know I'm in for the rest of it.
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:57.340]   Cruz is a really great writer he really paints a picture and if this were a fictional story
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:00.500]   I'd be no less satisfied because it's very very entertaining.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:05.340]   Excellent great choice I can't wait to read that that's our audible pick of the day lost
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:11.660]   on planet China by Jay Martin Troost and you can get it for free if you could.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.660]   It's my sister one.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:18.860]   You get it for free at audible.com/macbreak.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:23.340]   I just love Audible I know you will too in your car at the gym when you're doing housework
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:27.780]   audible.com/macbreak we do thank them so much for their support of Mac break weekly.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:31.060]   I didn't warn you Peter Krogan so you don't have to do a pick of the week if you don't
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:34.980]   want to but I'll give you some time to think about it I bet you could find something that
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:40.060]   in your library that you think every Mac user should have but I'm not going to start
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:43.660]   with you I'm going to start with Mr. Alex Lindsey in the upper left hand corner to block
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:44.660]   Alex.
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:54.340]   So well no so I washed yet another good headset of headphones not my iPhone but the headphones
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:57.100]   and I hate it when that happens.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:01.860]   I've now decided that it's it's not really it's not really a prop anymore it's just an
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:07.140]   opportunity to test another set of headphones you know and and I think that I have found
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.300]   my favorites.
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.180]   So one of the rules is that they have to have they have to be in here they have I don't
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:17.660]   do any little like and they have to be like flanged you know I really like to have them
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:22.460]   go all the way into my hair and now I really need them to have a you know have some kind
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:27.700]   of phone jack so I don't want to have right I don't care how nice the headphones are I
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.020]   need to be able to answer the phone so on so forth.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.740]   So I hope I say this right the Edomat Edomat.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.740]   Edomat.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:37.180]   I use those I know what you're going to say those are my favorites too they're great.
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:44.500]   They are and I got to say I have used almost all of them almost all of the iPhone capable
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:52.260]   headphones I think at some point I've owned them and at some point I've washed them in
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:57.940]   hot water sleep and and so this is my newest pair and I am so happy with them.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:01.300]   I feel like they are easier to put in my ears.
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.300]   I feel like the sound quality is very very high.
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.060]   The sound quality I've been asking people when they said the sound quality is actually
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:14.220]   really good as far as the being able to hear me too.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.860]   They're you know they're a good design they're the right length they're you know they have
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:21.300]   all the things that are that are important and so I just that's my recommendation and
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.860]   they're actually a little less expensive too than some of the other ones I got I think
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.900]   these are 149 other 149 or 129 but a lot of them are running you know 140 more than 49
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:37.460]   179 and I spend a lot of time with my my headphones on and so so to me you know that's not that's
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:41.540]   not a big price to pay you know because I the other thing to know about when you when
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:45.100]   you wear these or Norse canceling I don't like Norse canceling because I can hear what
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:50.220]   it's doing with the Norse canceling it makes me look crazy more crazy than normal not like
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:58.500]   I started from normal so the the but they but when you put them all the way into your ear
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.260]   you actually run with a much lower volume because you're not competing with everything
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:05.100]   around you so it's actually in my opinion better for your ears now if you turn it all
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.580]   the way up it's worse.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:11.420]   These are the they call it it's the HR do you remember the model number I was just
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:17.380]   a HR 2's or h2 yeah and and I think it's the only one that they make that is that that
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:21.540]   is compatible with the iPhone that has the the headset and the mic and everything out
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:27.260]   and and it's they there's something that they they really thought out how they you know eat
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:34.260]   all all the way down to hf2 hf2 sorry yeah they they even thought out the way I didn't
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:37.940]   realize like this little slant here makes it much easier when you press it in yep it
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:42.540]   just goes mm-hmm you know and it's just really really well thought out so anyway that's it
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:46.980]   I have two pairs I have one I keep the gym and when I wash in my washing machine regularly
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:52.300]   it survived by the way it survived several washes so I don't know if they're more robust
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:58.420]   or I'm just lucky but yeah 129 bucks on Amazon list is 179 but I have bought several of these
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:03.460]   I just love them yeah I haven't tried it yet I'm gonna save that test I wouldn't recommend
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:10.660]   it yeah I wouldn't recommend it but yeah it works Scott born you haven't had a pick in
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.540]   a while what's your pick why I pick last week oh yeah that's right and I understand you
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:21.340]   ridiculed it did I ridicule it what was it it was the the zaguto Z finder I did ridicule
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:26.420]   it but I ridiculed it to your face as we were doing it I just gave it your hard time I wanted
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:30.300]   it it's not that I didn't want it I haven't even trust me if you actually touched oh I
[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:35.060]   desperately want I just can't afford it you'd be an owner yeah and as far as you can't afford
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:41.500]   it if I had your money I throw mine away so come on my pick this week is at the opposite
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:48.660]   end of the spectrum one seven hundredth of an Alex it's 99 cents it is an iPhone camera
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:55.740]   app so it's called dark room premium formerly known as steady cam premium you guys use this
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:03.060]   I don't know that one oh my goodness is it cool it it's it's origins are that you know
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:06.780]   we all shake a little bit when we hold this thing and try to take a picture so it had
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:12.140]   an image stabilization algorithm at use and that's when it was called steady cam but now
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:21.900]   it does a lot more it gives you a grid guide there's a timer it just really makes the camera
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:27.260]   much more valuable so you can steady things you can use the timer you can shoot in a full
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:33.180]   screen mode I've now just use this to take all my pictures rather than the standard iPhone
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:39.340]   app how fast is it pretty quick it's it's well now it slows down if you're shaking right
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:44.180]   you know it's going to slow you down a little bit because it's trying to get a steady shot
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:49.500]   so you won't you won't get that instant gratification of clicking the button and grabbing the shot
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.220]   because it's going to slow things down till you're steady but short of that it's it's
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:58.380]   fine I mean all these phone apps that take control of the camera add a little overhead
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:04.140]   but I don't find it in any way shape or form to be problematic and for 99 cents it's just
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.860]   I can't imagine anybody that's serious about taking pictures with their camera not owning
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:16.020]   it awesome very nice Andy and not co your pick of the week my friend well this is sort
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.540]   of an offshoot from a conversation we had a few weeks ago when we were talking about
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:28.460]   the new the the new Apple mouse I hadn't really played with Wake on's bamboo pen and tablet
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:31.780]   before and it seemed really curious about it seemed really interesting so actually you
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:36.060]   haven't sent me one to play with and it's becomes like one of my very very favorite
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:42.300]   input devices I've had tablets before but I'm not a real artist and I'm I tend to when
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:46.780]   I'm editing photos and stuff I tend to do it with with my mouse and I've always thought
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:52.220]   that tablets were a very very you know niches sort of thing for an average person to have
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.140]   they're useful for what they do but you're not gonna spend a hundred and fifty dollars
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:01.740]   for one unless you really have a need for a tablet the way the bamboo pen and touch has
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:06.180]   a has a couple of big advantages in that you yes it does have a pen and yes you can use
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:10.020]   it like a regular pressure sensitive tablet has buttons on the pen all the really cool
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:15.620]   features that you expect to find on a tablet but the tablet itself is also touch sensitive
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:19.940]   so when you're not using it as a pen input you can just have this on the side of your
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:24.020]   side of your machine and just like you would be interacting with it with a track ball pretty
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:27.780]   much if you think about it as a flat track ball that's exactly what you have here you
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:33.300]   can you can mouse with it you can stroke with two with two fingers and scroll with it it
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:38.460]   even has a sort of a virtual track ball feature where if you give it a quick stroke up it'll
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:44.180]   just the cursor will continue to roll and roll and roll and spin with with something approximating
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:48.780]   really good physics and therefore clicky buttons on the left hand side of the pattern underneath
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:52.860]   your thumb you can configure to all kinds of different all kinds of different things
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:57.860]   it's only 99 bucks so that's definitely within reach of anybody who's shopping for a premium
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:04.220]   mouse and I like it because it's just so versatile so it's a tablet cool it's a it's a trackpad
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:09.380]   that's also cool but it'll also stop me from this nonsense where you know see actually
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:14.180]   of course I still have one right here where you know I need a borrow I need to be loaned
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.300]   a product or something and so of course I have to sign some sort of agreement that says yes
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.700]   I will return it in a couple of weeks but it's still I don't have a fax machine I mean
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:25.500]   who I don't need a fax machine so the old so what I have to do is I have to print the
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:30.060]   damn thing out physically sign it with a pen then scan it then email it back or go down
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:35.300]   and kinkos this way I can just simply do signatures just for the things I need signatures for
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:39.580]   so the thirty dollar recommend the pen and touch as opposed to just the touch they make
[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:43.980]   three four different styles of it one is just touch one is just pen the pen and touch costs
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:50.100]   so little more than the rest of them that you may as well get the full McGilla I it really
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:54.580]   it's really is a feature where if you have it next to your computer at some point you
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:58.580]   will at some point realize well that's Steve that saved me like five or six steps and it
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:02.700]   was really just almost the perfect thing for the sort of stuff that I tend to do looks
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:10.300]   really great you know you know I was talking about it on the show I also like the fact
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:14.140]   that I thought this was just oh cool is isn't that cute they decided to put like a red tab
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:18.260]   on the side of it just like they have on the pair of jeans then realize oh no that's actually
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.660]   very cool they decided make that into the pen holder so that's the one time that you
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:26.100]   don't actually lose the so this is probably the one tab that I will be testing where I
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:31.340]   will actually not lose the pen sometime before before I was that's cool Alex you're going
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:36.540]   to say something I don't have that that bamboo but we have a bunch of the bamboo is and I
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:41.780]   have one that I keep in my in my I have a wack a regular wack I'm tapping with the real
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:46.260]   work on it at home but the bamboo is the one that I carry around on my laptop with my laptop
[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:50.980]   on my in my back carried around great well a great one of the great things that they do
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:55.500]   that some of the other ones don't is that the the USC cable is just a standard USB cable
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.980]   and it just pops out so it's just something I can just throw in the same sleeve is my laptop
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:03.580]   and I just I just carry that thing around so if I need to do you know quick at it but mostly
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.020]   what I do with it is I'm going feedback like I circle things and go you know I just open
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:11.340]   up Photoshop whatever I circle things and go change this and move this stuff around and
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:15.220]   move this stuff over here and and I'm not when I'm on the road I'm not really considering
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:19.900]   it for a I'm not considering it as something to do real artwork on it's just something
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:25.140]   that's a lot faster and easier than my than my track pattern mouse to to provide real back
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:29.940]   quickly Peter you use it I remember you used a wackum tablet in Australia
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:37.620]   if you looked at yeah I'm not a huge user of it it's it's good for some things but I
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:44.180]   I do have a tip if you're ready for that all right fire away my friend okay so dirty
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:51.780]   little secret of the Mac disk utility it has this thing in there that says smart data
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:19:00.860]   passed hopefully passed the dirty secret is that your smart data that the drive is collecting
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:07.620]   this is self monitoring technology that's built into every hard drive can show the drive
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:14.300]   in a state of failure or starting to be in a state of failure and yet the smart data
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:20.580]   flag still says passed so that when you examine a disk in your disk utility it says hey this
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:27.820]   thing's fine well there's a great little utility called smart utility that's made by a company
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:37.740]   called I guess it's pronounced Volatens software it's vo l i t a n s dash software dot com
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:42.940]   and this little twenty five dollar program called smart utility will let you get access
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:49.500]   to the data that's on the drive that's monitoring the health of the drive and this lets you know
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:54.300]   if you have a drive that's failing before it's actually failed which is actually the
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:20:00.420]   time you'd really want to know that and yeah of course this only is going to work on internal
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:07.220]   drives or drives that are some drives connected by a sat I won't work on firewire or USB but
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:12.740]   we've got it set up on my machines so that anytime I boot up a computer it gives me a
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:17.380]   smart report and I can see when I've got a drive that's starting to have problems and
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:22.860]   I can take steps to make sure that I'm either pulling the data off the drive and sending
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.900]   it back for RMA or just keeping an eye on it so don't trust the disk utility because
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:33.020]   it's just not giving you that information yeah so so what happened was that when smart
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:37.860]   was originally implemented the engineer said oh well let's let's make it tell the user
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:42.300]   whenever the drive is really failing and of course what happened then is that lots of
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:47.540]   drives and lots of computers got sent back because the smart data was telling it you
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:51.700]   know if you're if you're Apple and you're thinking about the cost of FedExing a tower
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:58.460]   right to you know back to your service center and then back out it's incredibly expensive
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.920]   and you'd rather just you know have the user come back to you once the drive has fully
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:11.660]   failed and I found this year I think five different drives that were in a state of pre-failure
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:16.540]   through this software and in each of those cases the disk utility said the drive was
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:17.740]   fine.
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:27.660]   Yeah no kidding 25 bucks you could try it for free and smart utility that's all good picks
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:32.620]   set it up as a startup item yeah thank you Peter my pick I've recommended in the past
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:37.460]   one password as a very mackish great way to keep track of all your Mac passwords but
[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:40.340]   there was one thing that always bugged me about one password yet worked on the Mac and
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:45.660]   worked on the iPhone but I also use other phones like the droid I also use other computers
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:52.900]   like Windows and it didn't share its you know passwords with those platforms so I found
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:22:00.580]   a program and I'm just loving it that does it's called last pass at last pass dot com
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:04.700]   it's more affordable frankly it's a dollar a month for the paid version you could try
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:14.300]   it for free so it's 12 bucks a year they provide versions for Windows Mac Linux Internet Explorer
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:22.380]   Chrome Safari and Firefox iPhone Blackberry Windows phone Symbian and Android so really
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:28.100]   everywhere you go your passwords are stored encrypted it generates passwords for you if
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:32.980]   you want it also has an online component so that you can get your passwords online as
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:39.060]   well and there's a free version so if you want to try the free version take a look
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:42.740]   at it and if you want to pay for the last pass premium it's a dollar a month which I
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:47.380]   think is quite affordable this is my new password recommendation everybody you know we all have
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:52.420]   so many passwords it's nice to have an automated way does also work on a USB key and when I
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:56.380]   haven't figured out yet I maybe I'll maybe I guess I could partition a USB key is have
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:23:00.620]   the Mac version in one partition and the Windows version on the other partition that would
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:05.980]   be kind of cool but I like and I've always used a USB key to keep my passwords on on
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:10.460]   Windows with a program called Roboform I don't plug it and the passwords would go away and
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:15.340]   I go to another computer and use it this does that it's called last pass at last pass dot
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:20.940]   com and it's my pick of the week we're done gang really appreciated a great show thank
