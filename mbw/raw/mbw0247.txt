[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.120]   Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core, Pixel Core.com
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.000]   for the Guild of Multimedia Artist, Pixel Core.tv.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.600]   It's good to be here for the podcast.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.120]   Hey, Alex.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.760]   How are you?
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.040]   Good to be here.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.120]   You're always here.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.640]   I am.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.520]   Unless you travel one.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.440]   I'm traveling next week.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.160]   OK, so--
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.680]   I mean, I'll be in 35,000 feet over China.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.840]   I'll be going from Tokyo to Dubai to Darcelyn.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.960]   Wow.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.520]   Is this for work or for fun?
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.320]   Work.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200]   I'm leaving it on Thursday for Tokyo,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.640]   and I'm there for a couple days.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.040]   And then I'm going to be flying out Monday night for Darcelyn
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.000]   where I'm speaking.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.960]   And then I'll be in DC where I'm doing some more work.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.040]   Amazing.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.720]   On the second.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.000]   It's so interesting when we have people
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.320]   who have actual jobs on this show.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.680]   When I hear about how people do their living thing.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.920]   Andy and Aiko, he's at home.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.040]   My home is my office.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   My world is my office.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   He's indeed.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.040]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.760]   There is no point in which I do not have crushing responsibilities
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.320]   that weigh upon me heavily at every good moment.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.240]   He is from the Chicago Sun Times and also the celestial waste
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.880]   to bandwidth in a regular on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.520]   We also welcome to our show.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.240]   I think it was on once before, right?
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.040]   Jason Williams from Second Year Software.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.280]   Oh, Leo, Jason.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.040]   No, Justin.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.200]   Justin, who are you?
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   Who am I?
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.280]   I just saw the J and I just-- I went with it.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.240]   That's almost as bad as when people call me that Teen Pops star.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.040]   Almost.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.520]   Justin Bieber is joining us.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.960]   Tell me about Second Year Software, my friend.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.680]   OK, so secondyearsoftware.com is my quote unquote job.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.040]   I am fun and polite as well.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.640]   So I've been doing it for five years.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.160]   We've got an app called Today, which is a countering app for the Mac
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.480]   and then Elements, which is a Dropbox text editor for the iPhone and iPad.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.120]   Love both.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   Love both.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   Love both.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.400]   Love with all right with Elements all the time.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.240]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.200]   Thank you.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.640]   Your check is in the mail.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.240]   So you're both a iOS developer and a desktop developer.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.840]   Yeah, started on the desktop back when my parents questioned
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.640]   why I went to school and then started a Mac software company.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.880]   Who uses a Mac?
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.240]   And then I kind of paid--
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.320]   No one uses a Mac, but now the iPhone stuff's kind of taken off,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.400]   so I'm doing it too.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.200]   Times have changed.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.600]   So gang, the big story is straight out of the boy genius.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   BGR, the boy genius report.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.320]   Apparently Thursday, the 19th, which is the anniversary
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.640]   of the opening of the first Mac retail store 10 years ago.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.520]   Something's-- something big is happening.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.520]   We don't know what--
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.160]   You already knows what it is.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.760]   But they're quoting some pretty big deal memos saying,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.040]   you're going to be working all night to 15 employees
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.880]   in each and every Mac store.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.800]   There's something's going on.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.000]   Any speculation?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.160]   Could it be that we were wrong about iPhone 5 or 4S,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.120]   I guess they're going to call it?
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.600]   Could it be?
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.760]   It's actually going to come out Thursday.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.200]   Seems gone.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.520]   Yeah, it seems odd that they would do something
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.480]   without a big flashy-- here it is, here are the features.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.840]   It also seems weird that they would just sort of slip it
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.320]   into stores and simply let people sort of find it.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.400]   So--
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.160]   My guess would be more lion.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.040]   Oh, you think lion will come out Thursday?
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.920]   If I was going to guess, it seems like they're pretty close.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.400]   No.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   No, you don't think so.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.360]   I'm trying to think of what else they would like.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.960]   Well, I think it's the cloud service.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.840]   That would be the sort of thing where it's interesting enough
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.240]   that people would have to sort of find it.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.440]   It would require a lot of training for the staff in order
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.200]   to use it.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.680]   Doesn't require a lot of hardware shipments.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.280]   And if it were really a tentpole feature,
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.520]   it would also jibe in with the idea of they're
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.880]   going to be blacking out the windows
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.440]   so that people can't see the new displays and the new things
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.840]   are going to be hanging in the windows.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.960]   They say they're going to put curtains, black curtains up.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960]   That means there's something--
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.840]   See, that's something physical, right?
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.080]   Assuming that's accurate.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.800]   It really is a tantalizing collection of data points
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.720]   because it's almost if you want to have
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.920]   that threat board behind you with every single thing
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.360]   that it could possibly be.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.720]   And you simply, CSI style, start peeling off.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.760]   OK, so it can't be a new Mac because we've had new Macs.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.920]   Can't be a new iPad.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.520]   It's almost certainly not a new iPhone because that's too big.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.200]   It's almost certainly not a new carrier
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.920]   because that wouldn't require new training.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.360]   So bla bla bla bla.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.880]   And so Sherlock Homestyle--
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.160]   I don't think there are people who
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.720]   are saying that I believe that it's
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.920]   this because that's where all the evidence points to.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.480]   I think it's because we have eliminated everything it can't be.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.520]   And it's pointing to just one of these three things.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.840]   I think it has to be BS.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.960]   Let me read you what the Boy Genius report says.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.440]   I said, we have heard from a solid Apple source, one.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.400]   Solid, but one.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.440]   That Apple may be planning something big for its 10th retail
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.640]   anniversary, Thursday 19th.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.520]   This is what they're saying.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.480]   There's an overnight shift planned for 10 to 15 individuals
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.520]   at each Apple store to work from late Saturday
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.040]   all the way through mid Sunday.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.840]   But wait a minute, I'm confused.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.160]   Oh, it wouldn't start Thursday to be this weekend, I guess,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.320]   even though the anniversary is Thursday.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.080]   During the overnight shift, the Saturday overnight shift,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.440]   it's going to be required that employees
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.000]   lock their cell phones in the main office.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.480]   They'll also have to sign an NDA.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.440]   There are a wide variety of roles we're
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.040]   told for the overnight shift, including all visual staff,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.600]   a manager, a business team member, a few genius team members,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.680]   one back of house employee, and a few generic Apple specialists.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.080]   I'm already saying this is BS.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.640]   It's nothing.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.120]   I don't think-- it doesn't make sense for them
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.440]   to do anything big when WWDC is two weeks away.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.120]   I think this is--
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.120]   I think it's a party.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.400]   BS story.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.960]   I think it's a party.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.800]   And Apple has never been one of those companies
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.400]   that does celebrate retail anniversaries
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.600]   or any sort of big anniversaries.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.280]   I think they did a 20th anniver--
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.400]   or 20th or 25th anniversary of the Mac poster.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.160]   But they don't really celebrate anniversaries
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.200]   like, say, a Microsoft or another company would deal.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.520]   They deal 10th anniversary this year.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.360]   OK, they say Apple employees would
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.280]   be putting up black curtains at all stores
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.960]   so that people walking outside cannot see inside.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.840]   Employees have had to download gigabytes of data
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.880]   from Apple corporate labeled training
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.800]   in a password protected zip folder that won't
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.120]   be accessible to managers until Saturday afternoon.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.800]   Lastly, all Apple retail stores have mandatory meetings
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.760]   on Sunday, May 22.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.440]   Most meetings are scheduled for the morning,
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.640]   but there are evening meetings as well.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:31.920]   I-- either this is completely bogus leak.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.040]   I can't think of what the alternative is.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   Or it could be-- it could be prep for WWDC, which is only--
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.000]   but why would they require 10 to 15 people in each store
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   overnight?
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.480]   And they wouldn't give that information to retail employees
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.240]   instead of actual employees in Cupertino.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.920]   They don't-- retail employees are usually
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.560]   the last people that are going to know that stuff.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.040]   I think this is just bogus.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.800]   The other rumor I saw is that it might be a New Yorkfield
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.840]   communication.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.480]   They're going to implement that into the stores.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.760]   But even then, no phone supports NFC
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.560]   yet other than, I think, the Google Nexus S.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.160]   Those two Google phones do.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.840]   I have one of them.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.720]   Yeah, there's a Google phone at the Apple store.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.360]   Use your Google phone at the Apple store.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.240]   But don't bother trying to use that iPhone 4
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.480]   because we don't support it yet.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.880]   Yeah, they won't do that.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.960]   I mean, I think they will do that concurrent with the release
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.680]   of a new iPhone.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.520]   I think that's pretty-- that would be interesting.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.960]   I can't think of what this could be.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.760]   I think this must be bogus.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.200]   They're putting out their summer fashions.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.880]   That's all.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.080]   They're going from long-sleeve t-shirts
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.240]   to short-sleeve mock turtles.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.120]   That's right.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.840]   Even all the comments in the Boy Genius Report,
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.040]   nobody can come up with what this could possibly be.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.920]   I'm going to call BS on this.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.800]   I just-- I can't believe anything.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.840]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.360]   It just seems so unappled to block out all the windows
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.240]   and do all-- I mean, it just--
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.520]   well, it depends on exactly what it is.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.600]   It's part of the frustration of covering Apple
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.360]   because you know that everyone has a list in their heads
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.560]   about eight different things that we're pretty sure they're
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.640]   working on, but there's no idea when it could be released.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.760]   Probably four things that could be released sometime
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.880]   in the next eight months, of which three of them
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.600]   could require a window blackout.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.440]   Again, if they're just going to be putting things--
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.080]   if they're going to be hanging new things in the window
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.480]   to say, hey, you've heard of--
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.160]   the commercial you saw Sunday night for this new service,
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   well, here's where you can come in and take a look at that.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.280]   I don't think it's BS quite yet,
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.400]   but I don't think the information is really
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.320]   thin on the ground.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.520]   Usually, the weak point of any Apple secrecy
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.320]   is at the retailer level.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   And let's say it's not unheard of for me
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.720]   to get information from people who work in Apple stores
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.800]   about stuff like this at a time.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.320]   I haven't received anything like that so far.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.160]   That doesn't mean anything, but it's kind of an interesting thing.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   I got to say that I have marked out a section of my calendar
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.400]   to say, be ready for something maybe happening that weekend.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.040]   I love the chat room.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.080]   They say, oh, they're redesigning the Apple stores.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.760]   This is exactly what I would expect from Apple.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.800]   It's a brand new look.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.320]   We're putting up black curtains.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.800]   Yeah, we're not--
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.840]   that makes sense too, because you don't want to--
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.160]   I don't think anybody wants--
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.800]   Apple is the one company that would absolutely not
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.640]   want camera phone pictures of workmen with ladders
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.680]   and scaffolding inside their beautiful presenting stores.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.760]   So it could be something--
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.120]   I think that actually makes more sense.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.960]   So don't get your hopes up.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.800]   It's just a new--
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.800]   They're moving the tables.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.160]   Yeah, they're moving the tables.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.680]   People are just clamoring for some WWDC news,
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.360]   so they're trying to make something big out of this,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.160]   when really, they're just going to redo the store.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.360]   There's nothing to it.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.520]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.920]   Let's find out about what you guys expect for WWDC.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.320]   Also, maybe we can collect all the rumors for the new Apple
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.520]   iPhone, which we now think will be called the 4S,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.960]   and what features will and will not be included.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.000]   We'll talk about that in just a second before we do, though.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.920]   Let's take a look at Go to Meaning,
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.240]   which now is kind of the ideal solution for your Mac,
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.880]   your iPad, even dare I say it, for your Windows machine.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.280]   If you're having a meeting, that's
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.960]   one of the beauty parts of it.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.440]   And there are a lot of meeting solutions.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.280]   Most of them aren't cross-platform,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.400]   so that's one nice feature, is that you can hold a meeting
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.640]   and you don't have to care.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.480]   Should you care?
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.400]   You shouldn't care what your client's running.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.120]   You should hold a meeting and your client should join
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.680]   that meeting, whether they've got the software installed
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.160]   or not, and just a click of the mouse,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.600]   it should be easy for them,
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.440]   especially if you're doing a sales presentation.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.240]   And that's what Go to Meaning is.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   Try it right now, go to meeting.com.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.240]   Click the Try it Free button, use Mac break.

[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.080]   try it free button, Mac break.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.000]   - We've been, I've been on Go to Meaning meetings
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.920]   every day this week.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.120]   That's nothing to celebrate.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.040]   - But it's better than what it could be.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.960]   - It would be impossible.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.480]   We have people in Japan,
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.800]   we're working for this trip,
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.880]   I'm going to do it people in Japan all over California,
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.520]   some folks in the East Coast,
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.680]   and we're all looking at the same presentation,
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.320]   we're all talking about what the issues are,
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.320]   we're all going through that stuff.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.160]   - It's so great.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.400]   - I don't know how we do it otherwise.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.560]   Even if you're just doing a phone call,
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.520]   the neat thing is you can,
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.120]   we even do this just for our phone,
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.680]   anytime we're gonna have a conference call.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.800]   We just do it through Go to Meaning,
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   'cause you get the bridge, the conference bridge is free,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.640]   there's a voice over IP bridge.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.760]   In fact, if one of your customers or colleagues
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.040]   is using an iPad,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.600]   they can just plug in their headset to the iPad
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.920]   and just use the VoIP built into the iPad
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.520]   and it's free Go to Meaning app for the iPad
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.520]   and have the meeting I've done,
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.040]   I've set out in the backyard here and done it,
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.920]   it's really incredible.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.520]   You'll dramatically improve productivity,
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.800]   streamline communication,
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.320]   you can schedule meetings ahead of time,
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.600]   you can even do it, they're so easy to do
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.000]   while you're in the middle of a call,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.080]   you can say, "Look, I gotta show you this."
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.040]   Collaborate on files and documents in real time,
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.840]   we start those meetings and if we wanna show people
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.400]   something we can,
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.760]   then by the way, they can show you too,
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.800]   'cause it's a two-way street.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.120]   So it's great for product reviews,
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.320]   demo, sales presentations, training sessions,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.920]   status meetings, all right from your desk.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.880]   Try it right now, go to meeting.com,
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.040]   click the try it free button,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.960]   use the offer code MAC break.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.560]   We thank Citrix, the folks who do Go on Meaning
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.960]   for being such great supporters of our show,
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.880]   they don't, you know, I wanna have a parade
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.320]   when the new studio's done from here to the new studio
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.240]   and they said, "We'll sponsor the parade."
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.400]   (laughing)
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   I think what we wanna do is have banners for each show
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.360]   with a host of each show marching behind the banners
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.400]   and might as well have a float for the sponsors.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.680]   (laughing)
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.440]   It'd be great, just one float, it's a short parade,
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.360]   it's two blocks, world's shortest parade.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.280]   - Have we gotten all the permits for it?
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.120]   - This is a petaluma app.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.560]   - We don't know what date,
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.680]   we can't get a permit till we know the date.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.160]   I think in August, just reminded you,
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.520]   this is petaluma, oh I know,
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.520]   we got a lot of permits for everything.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.600]   Everything.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.720]   - Maybe you should have that your float
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.520]   just be a big screen in which people,
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.120]   their clowns, bands, people throwing candy,
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.000]   they're all through a go to meeting window.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.840]   (laughing)
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.680]   Just sort of a Skype window.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.200]   - A virtual parade.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.040]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.400]   - Marching band powered by GarageBand for the iPad.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.360]   Just have people just walking with their iPads,
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.480]   pushing buttons, playing music, you know.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.480]   - That's a great idea, an iPad marching band.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.200]   That is a good idea. - Little speakers.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.640]   - We'll have to have a speaker in a wagon
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.480]   that you trail behind.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.840]   - Just, if you get enough people,
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.480]   those tiny little speakers, they become a bigger speaker.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.960]   - You know, actually, we have six,
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.520]   I have six Sonos, S5 zone players for the studio,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   'cause that's how you could listen to the shows,
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.360]   but you could also have music.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.480]   And if we wanted to have a party,
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.760]   you could take them all and play the same thing.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.600]   So we could just put them in the wagon.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.000]   And that's six of those, that's a lot of sound.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.640]   - That's a wall of sound.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.040]   I think we might need a special permit.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.560]   The special Pete Townsend rider.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.000]   - Or a lot of angry Western Petalumans.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.440]   No one wants to deal with the Western Petalumans.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.560]   - St. Vincent's does a parade every year.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.000]   - I'm sure we can do it for two blocks.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.280]   - With a little, they have the Pope,
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.240]   literally there's a Pope on a platform.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.080]   - Agate.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.560]   - They have their little trumpet.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.840]   - I'm saying it's butternig's.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.480]   - Butternig's, that's all we're saying.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.240]   So more evidence from Apple Insider,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.740]   just in that Apple plans something on Saturday.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:41.720]   The latest report says that,
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.040]   no, we've already seen all this.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.480]   Oh, Max Stories is reporting
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.520]   that Apple's scheduled store meetings
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.000]   seven a.m. on Sunday.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.760]   You know what, I'm more than what they think about it.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.320]   And more I think they've changed the inside of the store
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.080]   and they want to train everybody.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.880]   Here's where you'll be standing.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.200]   - They're adjusting the feng shui of the desks.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.120]   - Here's where you'll be.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.720]   Here's where you'll be standing.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.520]   iCloud, will we see an iCloud service soon?
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.760]   - It seems like it's coming.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.640]   I mean, that's the, it has to come.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.280]   I mean, I don't know exactly when.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.760]   I think that that's the big,
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.360]   it's not an if it's coming, it's a when it's coming.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360]   And I don't know whether it be iCloud,
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.000]   but they're going to do some kind of major update.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.600]   They're running out of boxes for mobile me, right?
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.120]   I mean, so they're not, you know, they're not.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.560]   - It's been a couple of weeks since the report
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.280]   that they'd signed from Peter Kafka
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.880]   of all things digital, they'd signed licenses
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.680]   with two of the major labels.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.600]   - And Apple was the only one
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.960]   that's really going through all this trouble, right?
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.080]   So Amazon, Google, and Amazon,
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.000]   Google said we don't need licenses.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.600]   Which, if Apple can actually tie those all up,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.520]   it may give them some advantages and may not.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.680]   - It's interesting, I would have said earlier
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   that Apple was standing back
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.680]   and going to let Google and Amazon take the heat,
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.200]   watch what happens with all the lawsuits
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.280]   'cause you know Sony and others
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.160]   are going to end up suing these guys.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.680]   And then step in, and remember,
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.920]   the record labels don't like how much power Apple has
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.400]   with iTunes, iTunes is the number one digital,
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.280]   number one retailer of all music now, too much power.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.320]   So I thought maybe this would be, but Apple may be cagey,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.160]   they might be saying, see, we're not so bad.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.400]   - Right, I think it could be worse.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.000]   That side of the fire is hard to deal.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.600]   - We're gonna sign up on this side of the fire.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.560]   - Right, I think the music labels are hoping
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.600]   that by signing these deals with Apple,
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.200]   they're gonna be able to then push Amazon and Google
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.080]   into having to sign these deals as well
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.120]   'cause they see, well, look what Apple's doing with this.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.800]   And if you wanna do all this great stuff,
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.520]   we've kind of allowed them to do,
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.840]   then pony up the cash, boys.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.160]   - It's so hard, as anybody who's ever
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.480]   handled a firearm, Alex Lindsey knows,
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.320]   so hard to aim when your target keeps jumping around like that.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.240]   - Well, and I think that we were just talking about this
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.000]   on Twitch, it really feels like the record companies
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.840]   and Hollywood and everything else are sitting on a hot griddle
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.920]   and they're surrounded and it's just a bit of fire.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.760]   - Another metaphor.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.520]   - Which fire that they're gonna jump it around in the griddle.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.680]   - But they're on a hot griddle, they know
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.600]   what they're in is not working, they're burning up.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   But the issue is that there's the fire,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.480]   a fire called Amazon, a fire called Google,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.960]   a fire called Apple, fire called Netflix.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.440]   And none of those are particularly good
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.240]   for their businesses if allowed to,
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.880]   they're good for a new business model,
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.640]   but not the business model that they have.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.760]   And they're desperately trying to try to,
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.960]   how do we keep all of these different companies balanced
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.360]   so that none of them get enough power
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.960]   to run them over.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.800]   The issue though is that these record companies
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.560]   in these movie industry, any one of these companies
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.000]   could buy all of them.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.160]   They're no longer like the little technology companies.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.880]   They are the big technology companies,
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.040]   they're these huge behemoths
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.640]   and it's fascinating to watch these massive behemoths
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.400]   tip toe around these Hollywood and the record industry
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.800]   because they could just,
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.920]   they really could just squash them if they got impatient.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.120]   - Well, you know, actually we're in a very competitive age
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.120]   because now Apple has to look at reports this morning
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.720]   that Amazon is going to do two Android tablets,
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.640]   a dual core and a quad core.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.920]   When you have somebody like Amazon,
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.360]   a big retail giant like Amazon,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.080]   they can make a credible threat.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.560]   - The biggest new Apple on the iPad.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.720]   - I don't think it's a power thing though,
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.760]   dual core and quad core.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.520]   It's going to be all down between functions and functionality.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.880]   - Do you know what I mean?
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   - Or features and functionality.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.480]   You know, the thing is, yeah, sure they have that,
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.160]   but can they create one that's really usable?
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.000]   - Right.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.840]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.880]   If anyone can create a decent Android tablet,
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.320]   it's going to be Amazon because they have all the content
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.160]   in place.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.400]   They've already got the music store,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.280]   they've got movie rentals, they've got movie streaming.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.600]   - They've got the music.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.840]   - They've got music and now they've got the Amazon app store.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.440]   So they seem to be further along than Google is.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.760]   - I think Google just has those I/O announcements.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.400]   - Yeah, but I don't think there's just the content.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.040]   I think that the issue is I was watching my,
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.680]   so my two year old daughter was playing with an iPad last night.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.600]   The first time I really seen her playing with it
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.080]   and watching how she organically is like noodling around
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.240]   with it and moving stuff around on World of Goo.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:04.240]   And there is something, you have to get that tactile experience
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.880]   so right.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.480]   And the iPad I think has it,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.640]   I think that when I played with the playbook, for instance,
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.760]   I don't think it had it.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.800]   - You know, I didn't, I'm sorry, no, no, no, no,
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.840]   not the playbook, the Galaxy.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.680]   - The Galaxy.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.520]   - It was a little behind.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.560]   The playbook was much, much.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.400]   - The playbook is pretty snap.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.080]   - But everything's just, it has no apps.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.520]   It has no apps, but it's snappy.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.960]   But the point is, is that I think that a lot of them
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.560]   are missing that there's that last 2% or 3%,
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.400]   but I think that changes it for a lot of people.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.240]   - That's what you go ahead.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.640]   - That's the best of it.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.080]   - I think the problems a lot of these makers are having
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.320]   is that the iPad is a Ferrari and they're trying to build
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.000]   a Lamborghini, whereas Amazon is the company that's going to say,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.720]   "You know what, I think there's room here for Toyota."
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.960]   Let's make something that is not the most high performance thing.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.880]   Let's make something that is not necessarily a pinnacle
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.280]   of engineering that will go into the time capsule
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.720]   that we send into space so that aliens see how
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.920]   a doorably advanced we are.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.440]   We're gonna build the $119 one that will be the best $119
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.840]   tablet anybody can buy because it costs $119.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.080]   Everybody will buy it.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.280]   So that's why I think that they are indeed the biggest
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.120]   threat.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.440]   Not only can they build these things to make them affordable,
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.200]   but they also make great stuff that's affordable.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.800]   That's about as the $119 Kindle is a marvelous,
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.240]   marvelous little device.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.200]   And I'm sure that if they decided to build a $249
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.000]   color Android tablet that actually ran apps,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.080]   they would make sure that's totally focused on the things
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.600]   that people wanted to do, deliver exceptional value
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.240]   for the money and it would probably be the most usable
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.120]   Android tablet anybody ever made.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.080]   - It's interesting that Kindle, the $114 Kindle
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.760]   is the best selling Kindle of all of them.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.840]   - It's already, I bought one.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.600]   - It was so cheap I thought, well I don't mind having
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.440]   a third Kindle.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.280]   And I wanted to see what the ads looked like,
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.120]   how intrusive they were.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.600]   And once you're in the book,
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.440]   it's exactly the same experience.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.920]   - Right.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.440]   - Yeah, I think forget Google, forget Facebook Apple,
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.960]   start paying attention to Amazon 'cause they're the up
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.280]   and comers.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.120]   - Yeah, they're very much like Apple and that they tend
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.760]   to only, they tend to pick and choose really carefully
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.640]   the sort of businesses they wanna get into
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.440]   and then they prosecute that intent so well.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.760]   Whereas Amazon, everyone was watching the Google I/O
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.080]   conference last week and there's at least,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.400]   now they've got at least seven balls up in the air
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.160]   and I don't think they're really focused on anything
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.520]   except for search and ads at this point.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.000]   Everything else, they do a lot of things extremely well
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.640]   but you don't feel as though there's anybody at Google
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.880]   saying that it is absolutely essential that we get
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.400]   Google Chrome and Chromebooks so successful that it transforms
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.360]   industry in five years.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.720]   We know this is possible and we're gonna make that happen.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.320]   It's just, okay, well, hello Chrome provision,
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.480]   check back for the senior, we'll see if you got something
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.720]   - And nowadays you can't throw something out like that
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.600]   and not have it succeed unless you throw all your resources
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.880]   behind it and make it a hit, I think, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.000]   I think the public picks up on how serious you are
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.960]   and how much you're personally investing it in.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.560]   I think Google says that,
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.000]   - Okay, use it, don't use it.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.080]   - It's okay with us.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.920]   - Right, I think the one of the-
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.760]   - We got money.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.200]   - And you know the public that Google cares about
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.160]   and Apple should care more about is this guy right here,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.560]   the developer.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.760]   - Well, but I think that isn't,
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.720]   and this is the question for the developer,
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.240]   is the issue I think though is that when you get,
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.240]   when you're a bunch of people buying $120 Android apps,
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.920]   the question is how many apps are they,
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.800]   is that really the market that's gonna buy
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.360]   tons and tons of applications for it?
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.280]   You know that, I think that one of the things
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.200]   that Apple's taken advantage of is the fact that
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.640]   the raw sales of any of these tablets
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.920]   is not as important as the fact that the kind of person
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.720]   buying that tablet is the kind of person buying
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.200]   a lot of applications.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.280]   - Right, and the biggest problem I had with the
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   Honeycomb tablets, I was one of the eight people
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   who actually went out and bought a Zoom,
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.760]   is that there are no apps for it.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.360]   And the app experience, most people don't think of it
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.520]   when they're in the store,
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.840]   that's what actually makes the iPad and the iPhone,
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   and even an Android phone that great.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.400]   - But don't you say that as an opportunity then?
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.280]   - No, I don't. - As a developer?
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.120]   No.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.440]   - Not in the case of, well, I think I would have it,
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.640]   most people will say that there's not really that much money
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.240]   in Android apps because Android people are expecting things
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.000]   to be free, which I tend to think is pretty true,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.240]   but I tend to build apps that are more for nerds.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.080]   So I pretty much, I don't try to target
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   like your mom and your dad.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.640]   - Well, Android's a nerd platform, if ever the next one.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.520]   - I try to target the people that are like listening
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.080]   to this show or this week in Google,
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.600]   and I think they'd be more than willing to pay
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.000]   five bucks for something, but in my case,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.320]   I don't have the resources to build
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.480]   for four different platforms.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.760]   I build for the one I like and the one I have fun with.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.400]   - I think that that's the vast majority
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.040]   of the Apple ecosystem is developers who write for Apple
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.160]   'cause they love it.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.200]   - Well, and most of the, I mean, I've talked to a lot
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.600]   of developers that are doing both of them,
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.520]   and what almost every developer has told me is that
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   Android, they're making a lot of money doing,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.640]   building applications for corporations that want to deploy
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.320]   on to Android and want to make it.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.560]   So that's where they make their money on the iOS side.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.640]   They're doing a little bit of that,
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.600]   but what they're really making more money on
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.920]   is actually retailing the applications that they're selling.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.360]   And so it's just two different worlds
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.200]   from their perspective.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.800]   That kind of makes sense, actually.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.960]   - Have you put Honeycomb 3.1 on your Zoom yet, Justin?
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.560]   - No, I said that thing back.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.120]   (laughing)
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.440]   No, when they--
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.480]   - Supposedly it's a lot better.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.800]   Supposedly it's a big improvement.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.920]   - No, but here's what happens.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.200]   So if I spend $600 on a tablet to see how it is,
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.960]   and then a company's gonna tell me that,
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.200]   oh, well, you'll get the update in a couple of weeks
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.960]   behind the Verizon version of this.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.600]   Oh, and by the way, the SD card is still not gonna work.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.160]   And by the way, only the Verizon one's gonna get the movie store.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.160]   I just, I kind of threw my hands up and said,
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.280]   I'd rather buy a second iPad for that.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.720]   - Yeah, they're kind of right.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.040]   I like this Galaxy tab.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.880]   I've been using it more and more all weekend,
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.360]   the 10.1 tab.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.000]   Needle, it's good.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.040]   I think it could catch up.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.880]   I think by the end of the year,
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.560]   it could be a strong contender.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.400]   And I agree with--
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.760]   - I mean, yeah, that's the problem with Honeycomb
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.640]   and with the Android tab,
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.240]   which is not that it's a bad OS.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   It's kind of buggy and it's got some stuff
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.080]   that needs to be polished.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.320]   But as an OS, I think it's pretty good.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.920]   I wrote a giant review of this on my personal site
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.360]   where I said that pretty much I think
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.320]   that the Android tablets have a fighting chance
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.600]   as they improve the OS.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.200]   But with them not getting any apps out there
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.760]   that are designed specifically for the tablet,
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.880]   that's where they're gonna fault
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.400]   because you can't just run giant versions of the phone apps
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.560]   and think that's a good experience.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.400]   It's terrible.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.680]   - I think that the smart investments
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.920]   that Google could make is to simply say,
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.160]   we're gonna get out the checkbook.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.760]   We've got a million dollars to spend
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.880]   to just flat out buy loyalty from developers.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.920]   Simply say, we've seen this, they can even tell you,
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.640]   we really like that elements app
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.840]   that you develop for the iPad.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.720]   Here is $100,000, please write us a word processor.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.320]   And then go to other companies,
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.520]   say we really like this, this outline
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.800]   or you've made for the iPad.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.440]   Here's a quarter million dollars.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.000]   Please build this for us.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.360]   A presentation app, they just need to have
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.920]   that checklist of six apps.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.600]   They absolutely absolutely have to cover for tablets
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.200]   and simply say, we don't care if we're gonna be undermining
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.040]   of the developers.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.920]   At this point, we need to make sure we're serving
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.480]   the needs of the users who are looking for good apps
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.920]   for these tablets and not finding them.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.200]   - I think that the only challenge though
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.040]   is that with the iPad and the iPhone,
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.640]   I think part of what I find so fascinating
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.760]   is almost anything I think of,
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.960]   just about everything that I go,
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.240]   oh, I really need an app for this.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.440]   There really is, you go searching,
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.280]   it's suddenly fine, no, it may not be the perfect solution,
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.280]   but it's just that massive reservoir of applications
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.120]   that are available.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:27.960]   - Actually, they're gonna be more apps available
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.160]   for Android by the end of the summer
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.880]   than there are on iOS.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.800]   I don't know if there's a lack of apps.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.560]   There might be a lack of polish.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.600]   There's certainly a lack of tablet apps.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.000]   Although unlike the iPhone, at least Android apps,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.200]   the iPhone, they don't scale at all that you say.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.240]   This is the form factor and you could double it
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.880]   if you want and it looks crappy.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.400]   On Android, almost all apps will at least use the space
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.840]   and depending on how smart the developers are,
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.840]   they'll scale to fill a space.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.160]   It's not ideal, but it works okay.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.000]   - Right.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.160]   - I don't know.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.840]   - Yeah, but if you're spending $600 on a tablet,
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.000]   you don't want to run giant versions of your phone apps
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.560]   'cause you may as well just buy a little child.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.600]   - But my point is they're not.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.360]   In fact, things like Four Square,
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.400]   which is clearly only written for a phone size thing.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.280]   When you put it has big buttons, I admit,
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.960]   the buttons end up stretching halfway across,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.720]   but you turn it in its portrait mode and it works pretty well.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.040]   I mean, it's doable.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.240]   The maps are full-scale.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.080]   I don't know.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.920]   I mean, I admit it's not there yet,
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.000]   but I think it's closer than maybe Apple realizes.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.240]   And I think if Amazon jumps into this
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.560]   with an incredible ecosystem,
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.360]   maybe a little bit more mature honeycomb,
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.440]   Amazon's already got some exclusives
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.920]   and you know, in their app store,
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.040]   they announced that Angry Birds,
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.280]   Plants vs. Zombies and Chuzzle will be exclusive
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.160]   to the Amazon app store, not in the Android marketplace.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.400]   That to me is Amazon saying we're moving in.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.520]   Get ready. - They have exclusivity
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.760]   of Plants vs. Zombies.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.880]   - Now, from an Android point of view,
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.520]   from a user point of view that doesn't matter to me,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.280]   I'll buy it in the Amazon store.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.720]   I don't have to have an Amazon tablet.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.000]   I could still buy it on any Android device.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.840]   But what it's saying is we want to kind of own
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.680]   this ecosystem.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.520]   - And here's the question is,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   if everyone starts doing that,
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.200]   doesn't that get into this whole crazy,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.560]   forking world of--
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.400]   - It does.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.240]   It's already got a store.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.000]   - Yeah, it's already the forking world,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.560]   very much like the Apple App Store versus desktop apps.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.680]   How do you, I can wanna ask Justin about that.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.400]   Actually, I've got a lot of questions for the developer.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.960]   It's time for Ask the Developer.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.880]   - Ask the developer.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.000]   - I'm still dreaming about this $100,000
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.240]   and he was talking about Google.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   (laughing)
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.440]   - He's just staring at the corner.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.280]   - Money.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.680]   - I know, I know, I should've said 50,000.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.680]   - Money.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.880]   - So Justin, William, second gear software,
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.080]   we're gonna ask you a couple of questions,
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.560]   including have you received a lawsuit yet from LODESIS,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.880]   but before we do that,
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.600]   oh, you see you spoiled the tease.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   - Oh, but I had trust me,
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.040]   I've got plenty of opinions on this.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.880]   (laughing)
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.720]   - We'll talk about it.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.960]   And a whole lot more, Justin is here
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.080]   from second gear software, Justin Williams,
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.680]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.200]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.840]   Me, I'm just your friendly announcer.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.960]   Here to tell you about Squarespace.com,
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.840]   the Zebravine exceptional websites.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.760]   I'm getting excited, Squarespace sent us a new logo.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.920]   I have a feeling the new Squarespace 6
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.240]   is about to come out any minute now.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.160]   I'm very excited about that.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.040]   We've all talked about Squarespace, we use it,
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.520]   Alex, you use it for a long time.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.840]   It's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.960]   You could try it free right now,
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.240]   just go to squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.840]   You get hosting plus software.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.800]   - And I think that's really important,
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.120]   that whole hosting plus software.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.640]   I mean, if you're trying to put up your first website
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.640]   or you're trying to put up even,
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   you're finally getting a site that actually works.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.720]   And one of the big things that is always the whole,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.680]   like how do I install it, how do I upload it,
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.720]   how do I get this all on to some server
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.120]   and what server and colos.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.320]   And you don't have to think about any of that.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.880]   You just to think about the site that you want,
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.560]   you load a template, you start working on it.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.680]   - Trust me, yesterday I was in SSH hell,
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.400]   downloading the latest WordPress,
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.480]   downloading the latest updates to the plugins.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.560]   And I'm going, why, why, why don't I use Squarespace?
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.240]   Well, you know, I use WordPress,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.920]   'cause I guess I need to know about WordPress,
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.240]   so I use it on my personal blog,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.800]   but I'll tell you on our company blog, it's Squarespace.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.200]   - My personal blog, Squarespace.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.760]   - Yeah, it's just so much easier.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.560]   And plugins updated automatically.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.440]   In fact, you always get new features,
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.000]   which is kind of fun, you log into your site
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.280]   and you go, oh, look at this.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.840]   Now they've got a quick integrator
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.720]   or they've got a Flickr integrator,
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.760]   Picasso or Twitter or Facebook
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.440]   for all that social integration you like.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.480]   And you know, it's really cool,
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.760]   this is an example of how easy it is to use Squarespace.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.840]   Take a look at the social widgets.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.520]   For instance, here's the Flickr widget.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.120]   You could choose between a slideshow,
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.400]   photographers love this or thumbnail view.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.440]   You can completely change everything,
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.320]   just with sliders and clicks.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.160]   So you don't really are.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.400]   - And you really are, you're dragging that widget in
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.560]   and then you're moving a couple of sliders
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.400]   and then you're done.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.240]   - Couldn't be easier.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.840]   It's unique to your site.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.680]   That's one of the things I like
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.600]   is about Squarespace, every site's unique.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.960]   But it's easy, you don't need to know JavaScript
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.560]   to CSS to do amazing things.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.800]   Now if you do, this guy's the limit,
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.160]   'cause of course you can use JavaScript,
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.800]   you can use CSS.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.400]   You can make a site that is just to die for
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.840]   and then use that Squarespace hosting,
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.360]   you'll never run a bandwidth.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.400]   The price is right too.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.800]   In fact, the longer term you sign up for,
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.160]   the better the deals, in fact up to 20% off
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.520]   for the long term plans.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.080]   $12 a month, that's the basic, including hosting,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.320]   including software.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.960]   But the best thing to do is try it free.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.800]   Click that big green button when you go to squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.360]   You don't need a credit card, you don't need anything,
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.360]   but the name of your site and a password and boom,
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.640]   you're in designing a site.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.680]   Great way to give a friend or a family member,
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.800]   you've been kind of trying to get them on the web.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.760]   Design a site for them and say here,
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.560]   I made it for you, just use it now.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.520]   Kid going off to school, a new baby,
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.080]   an event, your organization's planning,
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.320]   it just couldn't be simpler.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.160]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.840]   We thank them so much for their supportive
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.680]   Mac break weekly and all the Twitch shows.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.000]   They have just become, I think,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.080]   I just looked at the numbers,
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.800]   they're our largest advertiser,
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.120]   which we really appreciate.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:07.960]   They're putting some.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.280]   Very kind of both, and they're good.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.600]   I like them.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.520]   I like them.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.880]   All right, loads this, LOD, SYS, basically,
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.800]   I mean, I don't want to slam them,
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.680]   but they're being accused of being a patent troll
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.840]   because they're patent trolls.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.680]   Let's just say it.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.840]   Let's just say it, patent trolls.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.360]   They're just patent trolls.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.720]   They claim that they have the patents for in-app purchases
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.560]   and/or app store purchase links in the apps,
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.320]   and they have gone after the smaller iOS developers.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.000]   They're not going after Apple
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.720]   'cause they would be crushed.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.600]   Well, LOD says, "Apple is already a licensee
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.040]   as is Microsoft and Google."
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.520]   So they say, "Apple's licensed it,
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.960]   but what about you, Justin Williams?
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.520]   What about you?"
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.920]   Yeah, this is the part where this is really scary for me
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.920]   because at present time,
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.440]   I think there's about 12 developers
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.880]   that have gotten these letters.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.240]   I mean, some of them,
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.120]   the one that's the biggest one out there is James Thompson,
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.600]   the guy who makes a PCCalc,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.160]   which is a really great calculator app for the iPhone.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.080]   Patrick McCarran, who's a guy I know
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.120]   who does a Shanghai Ma Zhong app.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   And then just today,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.400]   the Twitter-ific guys at the icon factory got their letter.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.200]   And it seems like this is all just centered around in-app purchases.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.440]   So LOD SYS thinks that by having this in-app purchase ability
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.920]   to upgrade from a free version to a paid version,
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.800]   they deserve a percentage of your revenues.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.320]   Even though you're using Apple's APIs.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.640]   No.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.040]   In theory, though, the problem with this is that
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.120]   as a developer, we tend to believe,
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.440]   and I would assume that Apple would think that if they did actually license this,
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.040]   that they would believe that their license would cover us for this.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.440]   And LOD SYS is instead saying,
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.960]   "Well, even if Apple did kind of give us some money,
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.720]   their license can't,
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.920]   they actually said this on their blog.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.000]   They can't spray pixie dust
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.640]   on the entire development community.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.720]   So let's go after these little guys
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.760]   who definitely do not have the money to fight a patent suit and say,
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.840]   "Well, you can either go to court for hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.120]   or you can pay us a couple of thousand and we'll go away."
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.400]   So it's a racket.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.000]   They're trying to just shake money out of us.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.400]   They want 0.575% of US revenue.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.480]   So they point out,
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.200]   "Well, if you make a million dollars on in-app purchases a year,
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.840]   you would owe us $5,750.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.560]   It's not a huge amount of money."
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.080]   Right, but that's the start.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.640]   So if you've actually looked at their patents,
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.520]   which I'm definitely not a patent attorney
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.160]   and I was bored to tears reading this thing,
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.600]   but it's so vague and it's something from so far ago
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.360]   and nothing in it seemed like it was some sort of like great innovation.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.120]   It was nothing that you couldn't just think of on your own and build eventually
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.840]   without even looking at their patent.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.160]   And you have to imagine that there's other people out there
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.840]   that have similar patents,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.400]   not necessarily for in-app purchase,
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.880]   but for other functionality in mobile apps.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.240]   So if LODESIS wins this,
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.640]   then you're going to be getting calls from patent guy X or patent guy Y
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.240]   saying, "Oh, well, we want our share too."
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.360]   And then it just becomes a really hard proposition to make money on iOS
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.560]   when all these different people are coming at your pockets.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.200]   Seems like Apple should do something about this
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.840]   because this is, hurts them as much as it's a little bit of a validation.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.440]   It seems like they should be suing LODESIS for clarification.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.200]   Right. Yeah.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.000]   My theory on this based on what I've read is that
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.400]   if Apple has licenses from LODESIS, as they say they have,
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.520]   I believe that Apple probably thinks that their license covers the entire app store ecosystem
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.440]   and LODESIS doesn't think that.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.280]   And they think that everyone should have to license it no matter what the developer is.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.840]   And it's probably going to have to go to court
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.520]   and it's going to cost everyone a lot of money.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.040]   And then we're going to sit around and wait and kind of wonder,
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.200]   I mean, in the interim,
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.480]   what this is done for me as a developer is that I'm not using any in-app purchases right now.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.200]   He sure as hell knows.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.400]   He's planned to, do you?
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.560]   Yeah, I had plans to use it for some stuff I've been working on,
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.400]   but there's no chance at hell I'm using it right now until this is cleared out.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.400]   So the best thing Apple could do is come out and say,
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.800]   this is what's happened, this is what we're doing about it,
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.080]   this is what we advise you to do.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.680]   The worst thing they could do is give us the Cupertino silence and say nothing.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.120]   I'm trying to, you know, think, I mean, I'm trying to remember presidents for this.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.560]   Of course, every developer uses libraries and APIs provided by
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.080]   the company that makes the hardware or the operating system.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.400]   That's really standard practice.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.000]   Microsoft has a whole bunch of libraries that every developer uses.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.120]   And you would think that this, if this really opens a can of worms,
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:38.600]   because if I'm liable, because I used a company API or a company toolkit,
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.400]   provided toolkit, if I'm liable for the licensing of that toolkit to a third party,
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.400]   as you say, Justin, this is a never-ending.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.880]   I mean, the overarching problem of this is the whole idea of software patents
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.400]   and I'm definitely of the belief that software patents are a terrible thing for this industry.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.800]   And I think this is, this has a definite ability to make things go a lot worse.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.160]   If people start are actually able to pay a lot, and set a precedent,
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.320]   then I think we're going to be in a for a really bad time as people who applied for
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.960]   these pie in the sky patents back in the early 90s, come out of the woodwork and say,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.880]   hey, we thought of this idea.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.760]   We didn't actually implement anything, but we're sitting on the toilet one day
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.600]   and we just thought, hey, that'd be a good idea someday.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.520]   And then 20 years later, hey, guys, pay up.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.600]   Give me some cash.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.080]   I mean, I don't, you know, we talked with Dan Bricklin about this,
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   the creator of the first killer app, VisiCalc, and he wrote a very long, thoughtful piece on his blog.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.160]   We talked to him last Wednesday on triangulation.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.000]   And he said he's essentially in favor of software patents.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.320]   I think maybe the issue is not software patents, but just the implementation
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:47.080]   that the USPTO grants a patent to anybody, doesn't really do much due diligence on it.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.440]   But it just kind of waits for the courts to determine if there's prior art, as opposed to saying,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.920]   hey, let's see your implementation.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.880]   Let's, you know, prove to me that you own this, prove to me that you were the first.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.880]   Did you say?
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   That sounds good.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.640]   The biggest problem is number one is that they're not showing an implementation.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.120]   So the guy who loads this wasn't the people who actually made this patent.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:14.920]   And we should say they are they, we may use the word patent troll, the politically correct
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:16.840]   term is they're a patent holding.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.840]   He's a patent holding company.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.840]   Yes.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.240]   So they, they bought these patents for a giant lump sum.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.080]   I'll hold that patent for you, sir.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.840]   I'll hold this patent for you.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.680]   And the guy who created the patent, he didn't actually build anything.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   So number one, you shouldn't have a patent.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.280]   If you're going to have a software patent, you need to show something that's actually
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   been built.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   Number two, the technology industry moves way too fast for a 20 year patent.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.520]   These things should be lasting for maybe a year, maybe three years.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.600]   And in my case, though, I think that software developers all learn and copy from each other.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.480]   They don't necessarily steal things.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.520]   But if you look at Delicious Library and you look at iBooks, I mean, somebody.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.520]   Somebody stole something.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   Somebody stole something.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.480]   And you didn't see someone like Will Shipley patenting the idea of laying out books in
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.480]   an app on a book show.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.040]   He was a little miffed, but he didn't have a patent on it.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.040]   Right.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.120]   And I don't, I think that the entire software industry has built on somebody does something
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.760]   and the next guy is a competitor that goes on and improves it.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.920]   I mean, there is a fine line.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.560]   You have to dance between blatant copying and innovating.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.840]   But I think in the, in the overall, I think that if you're innovating and you're building
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.680]   stuff and you're not just copying, like you would say, a Samsung Galaxy S copies and iPhone,
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.120]   I think it's good without having to go through patents.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.640]   Well, there's another story.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.440]   We'll see that one in about 10 years from now.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   That law suitably.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.040]   I, you know, my, my, I'm not a patent lawyer.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.160]   I'm not a lawyer and any, by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:41.520]   My understanding of the patent system is that it's to promote openness is to promote the
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.520]   notion that if you come up with something really good, you, there's a trade.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:51.400]   You, you expose by publishing a patent, you expose how you did it and you get in return
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.920]   for letting the world know how you did such a thing, you get an exclusive rights to it
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.520]   for a little bit of time and then the world gets to do it.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.360]   And it works in cases of big pharma, pharmaceuticals, for instance.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:09.280]   We have a whole generic pharmaceutical industry because the big pharma is allowed to patent
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.440]   how they made that medicine, reap the benefits of that for 20 years for a limited amount
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440]   of time.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.600]   And then the generics come out and we all, and society benefits instead of having it
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.960]   be a proprietary secret that nobody can ever know.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.640]   So there is, I think some merit to the idea.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   I think one of the, one of the real challenges is that, you know, when you start getting
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:33.600]   to this idea of, of patenting ideas is that, you know, we're moving from where we made
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.800]   stuff to where the entire society, I mean, this huge part of the economy is ideas.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.080]   And, and when we start having all these crazy patents, it's like basically having toll roads
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.080]   every, every three miles.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   Oh, you want to take a right there?
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.080]   Oh, there's a toll road there.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   Oh, you want to do a left here?
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.080]   There's a toll road there.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.760]   I mean, it's, it's, it's almost like the alternative to it is trade secret.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.760]   The alternative is we don't reveal.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   So you have a choice.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.960]   Let's say, and that's how we do it.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.920]   Like for instance, we have a, when we do our keying, or the way we, there's some magic
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.080]   sauce and how we do green screen keying.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.840]   Well, and that's a secret may be lost forever because you chose not to patent it.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.880]   And we did, but we are, our, our concern was as soon as we show how that works, we ran
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.120]   across something that was pretty original.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.280]   And we were concerned that someone else would just take it.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   So that's small to defend it.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.320]   That's why patents are there.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.960]   It's to encourage people like this son of a bitch to tell people their trade secrets,
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.000]   but be protected for a little while.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.160]   And that, the way it's, the way it's, the way it's, the way it's, the way it's chosen
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.240]   to keep it completely secret, I don't blame you.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.280]   And then what we'll do is as soon as we're done with it, we'll, well, that relies on
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.280]   your goodwill and on the road, open sourcing.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.880]   And so many things are lost that way.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:42.840]   And that's the whole point of this patent system is to encourage people to share.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.520]   So I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   I agree with you.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.680]   There's definitely systemic problems that we're running into right now.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.360]   But you have little companies like us, the amount of money that we put into, to, you
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.280]   know, building a patent, protecting a patent, putting it all together would be, you know,
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.000]   would be very difficult for a small company to make, make work and it's easier just to
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   keep it secret.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Right.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   And then you have these patent trolls on the other side.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   I mean, this is just an example of, of why the patent system doesn't work anymore.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.040]   The other issue that you're running into is that you were talking about the pharmaceutical
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.040]   industry.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.480]   And if you, in those industries, these are big companies that are going after one another
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.560]   that have lawyers on staff.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.840]   They're making billions of dollars.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.920]   When you see Apple suing HTC or Apple suing Samsung for patent infringement, those are
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.920]   big companies.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.760]   What Lotesis is doing is they're going after small companies like my company or the icon
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.520]   factory who can't afford to pay a $700 an hour patent attorney.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:38.120]   So if they can, instead of suing Apple, they can sue a couple hundred small time developers
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.920]   and get, let's say, a couple thousand dollars out of each of them.
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.520]   Well, they've made a pretty good payday for writing a couple letters.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.160]   I have to point out though, that if you eliminate software patents, you're still going to have
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.760]   companies with deep pockets litigating against companies who don't have the resources because
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.080]   even if there's no merit to the litigation, they can win.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:01.320]   That's, I mean, if you really want to stop that, you eliminate litigation.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.840]   And I don't think that's a good solution either.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.320]   I mean, the whole idea of having a system is that you have some fair way of figuring
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.320]   these thorny problems out.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.280]   I think what's broken right now is deciding what is patentable and what gets through the
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.280]   patent system.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.560]   Obviously, crappy PTO.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.800]   But that's the junk in junk out.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.280]   So the thing is that as patent inspectors are not paying any attention.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.720]   They're not, they're not equipped with the technical knowledge to understand what they're
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.720]   looking at.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.880]   I mean, I think that's the biggest issue.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:35.840]   I think that's what we need to do is not necessarily scrap the system, but get better
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.000]   patent inspectors, maybe better rules about this and so forth.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   I don't know.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.720]   The thing we got to do is we have to wait.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.760]   Apple needs to say something about this.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.920]   I'm kind of, this came out on Friday morning of last week.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.800]   So I'm going to try to give them until the weekend to say something.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:55.240]   But if this goes on up until WWDC, that's going to be the talk of the show for development.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:08.800]   That's the first thing I had that they did not make a colossal tactical error in waiting
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:14.560]   until after WWDC, because they're going to have Apple, Apple employees, and every single
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.360]   significant iOS developer in the same building together for several days.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:23.760]   And the real danger to that for this patent company is that all these people can have
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.440]   all kinds of conversations for which there will be absolutely zero paper trail so that
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:33.080]   if there becomes forms of consensus or if there wants to be some sort of a sub-rose
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:38.000]   of conversation about here's how we're going to respond to this.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Don't worry.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.840]   We're going to slap them down and slap them down hard.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.880]   That's exactly the best environment for that sort of conversation to happen.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.040]   It won't happen on message boards.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.280]   It won't happen through email.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.520]   It'll happen through these casual face-to-face conversations.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.800]   So I'm really curious to see what happens after WWDC.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.040]   If there's a whole change in the posture of what all these developers are going to react
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.040]   to this.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.040]   I think really was.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.680]   This is also suing Samsung brother HP and Motorola.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.680]   So.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.200]   But again, those are big companies versus small guys like the icon factory.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.160]   I think they're not just picking on the icon factory.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.160]   They're this is a wide.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.080]   See, that made me think of something else.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:15.640]   I mean, is this is the pressure they're putting on small developers largely just a way to
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   put additional pressure on Apple to say, well, you know, we could just simply sell you a
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:24.120]   larger license that would include include and incorporate everybody who uses your development
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.680]   platform.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   Is that part of their strategy?
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   I don't know.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.800]   I mean, that's what I was thinking is just pressing like they don't feel like they got
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.960]   as much as they could have out of Apple.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.200]   If they actually didn't agree, we don't know if we haven't seen the agreement.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.120]   We have no idea whether they actually have an agreement with Apple.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.960]   Maybe all of this is to just pressure Apple to maybe Apple doesn't have an agreement yet.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.240]   And they they're trying to pressure them to do that.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.200]   I think I think what what really loads us should do is reach out.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.320]   I think WWDC, they should bring their lawyers.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:55.720]   They should bring the principal holders and they should come to the WWC and they should
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.800]   meet at a bar, you know, in, you know, that's actually good.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.800]   It's actually good.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.720]   And I'm thinking it would imply that the company actually actively wanted us to seek
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.720]   information.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.200]   Well, and I'm going to suggest some really excellent places in the tenderloin.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.440]   Some good bars, you know, and tenderloin, by the way, for those who don't know, San
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:15.280]   Francisco geography is kind of the soft way underbelly of San Francisco.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:20.820]   The best way to travel throughout San Francisco is alleys, you know, definitely the
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.820]   exactly.
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.200]   They turn off the lights because they know there's going to be a lot of high traffic.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.240]   And what I would do is so people know that you're coming.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.240]   You're really coming.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:30.520]   You should turn the glimpse on, turn the glimpse on and go and then you want to take these
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:35.120]   little back alleys to the tenderloin and and and and whoever makes it to the to that bar
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.520]   then we can actually then how.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:40.080]   Oh, it's got the Darwinian patent system.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:45.200]   Actually Apple, according to the Guardian today in an article says that Apple is quote
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.440]   actively investigating the merits of this.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.800]   So I think I think you're right.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.400]   I think we'll hear something from Apple on this.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.400]   It just takes time.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.400]   It's like the location stuff.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.240]   They took a week to respond to it.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.280]   But when they responded, I think most people thought what their response was was pretty
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.280]   good.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.800]   And I can only hope that they're going to give us a good response, say, this is what
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   this happened.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.200]   This is why it happened and this is what we're going to do or this is what we advise you
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   to do.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.200]   As long as they do that, I'll be happy.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.560]   Well, as you point out, Justin has a chilling effect because you're not going to put in
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.600]   that purchases and until you hear some resolution on this.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.600]   And that's the thing that's touching that stuff with the 10-foot-pole.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   Unfortunately, you don't need to, but I do think it's important that Apple, if they think
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.880]   that they're in the right, they should be merciless about whatever they do legally.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.360]   I mean, they should pound this country.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.960]   When has Apple ever shown mercy?
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.960]   I know.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.400]   Well, I mean, the thing is, I think that this is really important for them to make sure
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.600]   it's clear not only are they going to handle this, but they're going to really make this
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.800]   expensive.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:41.080]   I think that's probably what they're considering is which tactical nuke they would like to
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   employ here.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:48.440]   They're looking through the library across the front there because I think it is important
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.320]   for them to defend their developers and how people get clear that if you pick on our
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:56.560]   developers, you're picking on us and we're going to take person.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.040]   Yeah, the App Store is a big business for Apple and getting developers to be concerned
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:06.320]   to use the platform because of pending patent infringement letters coming in is definitely
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.320]   not something they want.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.520]   It's definitely not something any mobile platform provider wants.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.240]   When I think we're really fortunate this conversation is happening now because I think
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.400]   that in App purchases, both from the Mac App Store and the iOS Store are going to become
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.400]   massive.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.960]   I tell you, if you're a publisher, they're huge because, you know, I was thrilled because
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.800]   I can get the New Yorker and because they were able to do in App purchases instead of having
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.920]   to download a new magazine every week because I'm a subscriber, I can get it for free.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.400]   Well, so there's a huge benefit to having in App purchases.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:38.240]   If you imagine a company like Adobe, I mean, if they, let's say they built a little version
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.240]   of Photoshop.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.640]   No, no, no, no, this is like I'm totally making this up.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:46.760]   So let's say that they had a little editing app, image editing app or whatever, and they
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.920]   started all the plugins that Adobe makes.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.040]   What if you could buy all those plugins, you know, right inside of Photoshop?
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.560]   Just what you need, you know, like, you know, and you wouldn't have to go anywhere.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.160]   And that could turn into a massive business.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.680]   You get to a point where you sell the core, you give away the core app and sell all the
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.000]   add-ons and everything else.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.240]   And I think it could be massive, but it won't, you know, this has to be sorted out.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.000]   And it's fortunate that's happening now rather than suing when everyone's got their feet
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   right deep into the cement.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.280]   Hey, Justin, I meant to ask you, you saw, you use Dropbox Elements, uses Dropbox, which
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.800]   is really the thing that puts it over the top for me.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.280]   But that and it's good looks.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.280]   Oh, thank you.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:26.200]   It's a very beautiful application.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.760]   But you saw that there's a little froufer all going on about Dropbox.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.320]   They're being accused of lying, essentially.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:39.360]   As we found out a couple of weeks ago, with the change of service license that Dropbox
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.160]   will turn your data over to federal or state or local government officials if required
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.400]   to do so.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.920]   That's pretty normal.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.520]   Except that Dropbox was telling us for a long time, we don't have access to your data
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.280]   because you encrypt it and we don't have the keys.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.920]   It's obvious now that Dropbox doesn't fact have the keys.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:56.920]   Oh, you mean this key?
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.920]   Oh, that key.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:49:59.920]   Oh, oh, this one you were speaking of.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.880]   Oh, oh, yeah, we have that key.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:05.240]   And so now they're being accused of lying about the fact that they didn't have access
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   to your data.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:11.240]   And I think there's some legitimate concerns that maybe Dropbox didn't want us to know
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:14.800]   that they, in fact, could look at anything we post on there.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.480]   You use Dropbox for your program.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.120]   I mean, what's your thought on that?
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.320]   I mean, I think there's a trade off when you use these cloud services, like Dropbox or
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.640]   Google Docs or box.net.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.240]   And that whenever I use these things, I don't assume that I have full privacy.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.840]   And I'm willing to give up a little bit of that for the convenience.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.840]   I mean, I haven't followed this enough to actually say what Dropbox was saying and what
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.520]   they said now.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   But I mean, in my case, it's not anything that makes me be that much of the outrage that
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:48.160]   much because I always have assumed that they have access to my stuff just because it's
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   on their servers.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.480]   I mean, there has to be a way for them to get at it.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:56.200]   I think this only bites people who believed Dropbox when they said, no, we don't have
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.880]   access to your data.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:02.560]   And so we're putting data on there that was when you're when you're offering a service
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:03.560]   for free.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.480]   And obviously they do have a paid account, but in general, it's a free service.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.280]   And when you're offering something for free, there is some sort of trade off like this.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.320]   So it's not nothing like this shocks me anymore.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.800]   I always assume that if I'm signing up for a free service, I'm the thing that's being
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.800]   sold.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   Right.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.840]   It's not in this case, they're not selling it to marketers or anything.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:26.160]   It's just they they they don't you if you wanted to encrypt it, you should encrypt it
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.720]   before you send it to Dropbox, because the key that they give you to encrypt your data,
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.800]   which they're very proud of is in fact in their possession.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.000]   And it's pretty obvious to anybody who knows about crypto that that had to be the case.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.520]   I think it really comes down to how important it is to have really good communications majors,
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.840]   keeping track of everything that leaves the company and goes into the company because
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.920]   I don't tend to think that this is just my take on it, but I don't tend to think that
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.400]   they were trying to deceive people into thinking that, you know, there's a level of privacy
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.400]   that wasn't there.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:01.040]   I think that within the company, they understand the difference between, well, it would be really,
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:06.520]   really difficult for us to get act for anybody to get access to individual users data, but
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:10.400]   they don't appreciate the difference between saying that and saying that no, it's not
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.520]   possible for anybody inside this office to get access to people's data.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.440]   But I think that we also need to help educate people as cloud services become more prevalent
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:22.680]   that there is there is on the internet and there is not on the right.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:27.760]   If your information is not on the internet, it can't be accessed or probably with a normal
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.760]   means.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.200]   If it is on the internet, doesn't matter that it's not on a web page, doesn't matter,
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:36.600]   you didn't link to it, doesn't matter that it's in a box.net or Dropbox or your Google
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.680]   Docs or anything like that, assume that it can't be compromised.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:45.360]   And this is kind of one of the reasons why I don't even particularly like online backup
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.160]   systems because it's God, if you have access to my entire, if someone gets access to my
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.480]   entire hard drive, that's everything.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.240]   That is everything I'm thinking, everything I'm doing business with.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:01.640]   Everybody I've ever told, don't worry, I will absolutely never tell this to anybody else.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:04.040]   And that's an email that could be somewhere out there.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:07.040]   Again, there's on the internet and there's not on the internet.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.800]   And really, it's just that simple.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   I agree with you.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.200]   I tell everybody if you put it on the internet, assume that it's not private.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.600]   And of course, the danger when you do that is not being able to get to it where you know,
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   no matter where you are.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.400]   I mean, that's the, that's our big advantage.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400]   That's the trade off.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:23.560]   You just have to, you know, the trade off is every time you use your credit card, someone's
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:27.040]   tracking and every time you, you know, so it's good for us to know.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.040]   It's good to be.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.040]   It's a lesson learned for the Dropbox guys.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.560]   I mean, I can't really think of anything they've done too terrible since they've been
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.560]   around.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.400]   This is kind of the first kind of negative football.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.520]   Well, they shouldn't have said we don't have access when they do.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.520]   Right.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.120]   But what they did, what they've done is they've most likely they've learned from this lesson.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.120]   And so they're going to go on and improve it.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   And it wasn't really, I don't think that what they did was with malice.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.400]   I don't think that they actually intended to deceive people.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.120]   I just think it was probably nerds trying to explain things in common terms.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   And we nerds aren't always that great at explaining stuff sometimes.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.760]   They just have the closet set, except.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   Except.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.920]   Except if somebody wants to know.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.120]   Gun and badge equals.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   Yes, sir.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   Yes, sir.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:12.760]   You'll have Packard has decided not to put thunderbolt in its next desktop PCs instead
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.760]   opting for USB 3.0.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.800]   According to HP, we did look at thunderbolt.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:24.080]   We are still looking into it, but we haven't found a value proposition yet.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.160]   USB 3 has more installed devices.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.240]   Is that a blow to thunderbolt?
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.240]   I don't think so.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:33.560]   I think that well, I mean, I think that in the beginning does anybody care what HP does?
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.560]   Really.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.240]   I think that the thing is, is the thunderbolt, I believe, and from what I understand of the
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.280]   two formats is that it's going to have a lower CPU hit.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:46.120]   It's faster the way that you're changing devices together.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:50.880]   Thunderbolt to USB 3.0 as Firewire was to USB 2.0.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.920]   In other words, it's more like Firewire was to USB 1.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.920]   You know, so I think that's the issue.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:01.040]   And the problem with USB is that there's just a lot of overhead, a lot of CPU overhead
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.040]   that we know.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.600]   It's also not peer to peer or is it.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.080]   I understand that.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:11.800]   I think it's master slave system because that's USB requires a smart device on one
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.600]   and a dumb device on the other end.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.760]   Firewire did not.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.480]   You could firewire two cameras together, for instance.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.400]   There was a peer system.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.880]   I wonder which one I don't know the answer to that.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.680]   Our chatroom probably does and will tell me in moments.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:29.040]   But I think with thunderbolt is that there's no devices for it yet, which is probably what
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.680]   I assume HP is saying is that there's no devices for it yet.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:36.120]   And I don't really consider a Windows user that goes into a Best Buy.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:39.560]   I don't think that you can sell them on, hey, well, there's this port on the back that really
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.960]   does nothing right now.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.400]   But someday it might.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.800]   Whereas with a Mac guy, we can say, well, eventually this is going to play out really
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.800]   well.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.960]   And people that use Macs will say, oh, cool.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.560]   Well, this will make me have a more future proof Mac that's going to last for several
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.080]   years down the road, assuming it'll actually.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.080]   It was something else.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.640]   And also really.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:02.360]   And also realize that when Apple put the thunderbolt port on the Mac books, they really
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.520]   didn't have to do anything except for simply say, you know, this mini display port, it's
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.040]   still a mini display port.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.040]   But in a few months time, it will do things other than be a mini display port.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.360]   Whereas HP, they already have a VGA connector for that sort of stuff.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.920]   And I think that it would be sort of an interesting, it would have to be a different commitment
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   on their port.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.480]   Also, they, I think they realize there's really no rush to embrace the underport.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:28.120]   That's, it's underbolds more of a 2012 feature, even for Mac people than a 2011 feature.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.720]   Yeah, I think the folks that are going to really benefit from thunderbolt in 2011 is
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.200]   going to be video professionals in the second half of the year.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:40.200]   And you look at the video and photography professionals specifically or anyone doing,
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:43.680]   anyone needing to move that kind of data, I think it's going to make a massive difference
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.040]   for them.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.480]   But I think that those are the primary benefactors.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.080]   Then we'll have to see what happens after that.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:52.640]   I wouldn't be surprised if you could make thunderbolt to support USB 3.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.720]   Yeah, I bet you there's going to be a little dongle that has a, that has a thunderbolt
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:01.400]   connector and a USB 3, you know, and you'll just be able to pop your USB 3 in and then
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   you don't have to think about it.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.960]   USB 3 is such a PC technology, isn't it?
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.520]   I mean, it just sounds like it belongs to a Windows machine.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.600]   Well, it's funny that it really became, it became that because Apple, Apple Start was
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.040]   the first, first computer to install USB.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   Right.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.440]   And IMAX, the early IMAX.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:20.480]   And then we got into this tug of war between Firewire and, and USB.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.480]   And SCSI.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.480]   And SCSI.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.720]   The late limit is Mr. SCSI.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.720]   Hey, I picked up a drive.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:27.720]   I was like, I wonder what's on this drive?
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.720]   And I looked at it.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.720]   I was like, oh, it's SCSI.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.720]   I guess I'll never know.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   What are you going to do with that?
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.600]   You can, we know, don't send me an email.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.440]   I know you can get something to work with.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   So let's see.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.240]   Any some way to look at my Iomega drives, my little Iomega.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.240]   You know for the drive.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.240]   Yes.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.240]   Well, you need a parallel port.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:51.000]   Apparently, according to Mac in rumors.com, Apple has trademarked the name for a new app.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.080]   It's just in actions from Pat and Lee Apple via Mac rumors.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.080]   Noteworthy.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   Ooh.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   Uh oh.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   Ooh.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.080]   Uh oh.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.080]   What?
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.080]   Pat and Lee, what.com?
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.080]   I can get you a good phone number for that.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   We'll help you out here.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.080]   Uh oh.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.000]   Now remember, Apple trademarks a lot of stuff.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.760]   Doesn't mean they're going to make it.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:20.160]   Apple's latest trademark for noteworthy points to new iPhone app.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:25.640]   Initiate scanner mode, capture images of surfaces, send images to stitching module.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   Hmm.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.280]   It's European trademark office.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.880]   Sounds like maybe it's never known.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.200]   Yeah, maybe it's more threat to ever know.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.960]   I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.400]   Microsoft's done very well with one note.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:45.440]   Uh there's definitely a market in the tablet space for note taking apps that use stylus.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:50.720]   Um, now it looks like it's a scanner, which wouldn't really, uh, wouldn't hit or hurt
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.920]   elements at all, Justin.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.920]   Uh good.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:53.920]   Okay.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.640]   Well, we don't need, we don't need to call Google yet.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   Not yet.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:03.040]   So yeah, this is probably looks like it's another, uh, thing that the mythical North Carolina
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:07.960]   data center is going to solve a cloud based note and capture apps for the guy.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:12.000]   Somebody inside Apple who's just spinning this stuff out.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.920]   Like it's that like the disinformation guy.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   Oh yeah.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   Let's get a patent for this and we'll pretend it's going to North Carolina.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.000]   And I just think that they are having so much fun with us right now.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.080]   Well, and I think that they, but they get into a situation where they have to, because
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.640]   of these patents, they patent every, they patent every idea that they have.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.360]   So that's somewhere down the road, they want to use it.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.480]   They can say, well, we already talked about that.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.080]   When you have a building full of lawyers, you might as well, you got to give them something
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.080]   to do.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:41.520]   I think that it's always funny to want to read that site, but it's just, I think it
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.840]   causes more confusion than clarity.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.440]   On the other hand, I think Apple could would make a lot of sense to add a note taking
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.160]   program to, uh, I work.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.720]   That's a very hot category that Apple isn't really fulfilling.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.680]   Oh, I think I know you don't like it.
[00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:00.760]   I'm just, I'm just saying, well, I'm aiming for a different market than the note taking
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.760]   market in essence, but I mean, for the iPhone version of elements, it's a really great
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.920]   note set, but for the iPad, I'm aiming more at people like Andy who are trying to write
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.480]   long form stuff than just when I get jot down my grocery list.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.480]   Good.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.160]   I think most people will be happier if they just made the notes feature and mail actually
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   work well.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.240]   I don't know anybody who's happy there.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.480]   The mail has so many features that outside of just its, its namesake features.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.080]   I don't know many people who are really happy with any of them.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.920]   I, I, I got into this research and I tried to figure out the best note taking out for like
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.200]   the iPad and I find all of them are just kind of like so close, you know, you know, but
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.560]   none of them, you know, I wanted to have, I wanted to have the, the, um, you know, really,
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560]   really good.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.120]   I wanted to look good when I'm writing on it, but you know, I want to type, but I don't
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.120]   type that off and on it.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.320]   I wanted to, I really, what I really want is to have it be something that's a really
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.320]   nice experience, you know, that is doing.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:55.200]   Do you want to have typing or do you want to have, you know, it's kind of like, like,
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.640]   so penultimate in my opinion is probably the best, the best image, like, uh, writing
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.640]   quality.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.480]   If I want to do it with my finger or a little stylus note taker HD.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.480]   This is Dan Brooklyn's program.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.280]   He came on and talked about, um, well, here's, here's, here's, here's also my,
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.280]   it's kind of deep and that's part of the problem.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.600]   It's hard to start to figure out what it can do.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.600]   I have it right here.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600]   You do have it.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.400]   And so the problem with note taker is that it, it doesn't, the, the quality of the, of
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.880]   the one I'm, when I'm actually writing isn't nearly as high as penultimate.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:26.320]   You could pop up a, a window, a bottom window that you can draw and then it is small.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.320]   You should, I'll check it out.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   I mean, it's kind of, you know, it's opaque, unfortunately.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.520]   Well, what I'm saying is it's like when you look at, when you look at this quality, no,
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:36.840]   I know pop up a text, you need to pop up the bottom text window.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.800]   And then you can anyway, anyway, so, so the, um, but anyway, so the, uh, what I found though
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.360]   is that it didn't, it didn't feel like it wrote as well.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.920]   But then the other thing that I really want is to have audio, you know, I wanted to record
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.080]   the audio while I'm taking notes, so I had one of those little, you know, and I, and
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.160]   that and having that feature really work well for meetings is just massive.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.160]   That's huge.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.280]   You know, and, and if I, if I could just have those two things together and I don't want
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   it to do a lot of things.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.520]   I just want to do those two things where I can just tap on the words that I, that I was
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.520]   writing while I was in the meeting and it plays back the audio.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.520]   Uh, you know, and there's a lot of people that do those things.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.720]   It's just that with note taking, it doesn't seem like they're all coming together.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.720]   That's the category.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   This always disappointed me.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.320]   That's, that's the reason why whenever I'm at the events, I always have one paper notebook
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:22.120]   in my shirt pocket, a second paper notebook, my laptop bag, and maybe I'll have the ambition
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:26.640]   that this new app that I downloaded for my desktop or my iPad a couple of weeks ago will
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.920]   be finally the one where I could actually follow along.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.520]   And if I accidentally mistype something, I'm not going to screw everything up and not
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.360]   be able to get back into, you know, the moment that I want to start to record in, it always
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.080]   comes down to I'll either write it.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.040]   The pen is the only one that will not make any mistakes.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:46.520]   I've actually been using the life scribe pen off and on and finding that it's a nice little
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:51.080]   hybrid between it's the one recording device that will always allow me to make notes where
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:55.600]   I want them, plus giving me the advantage of maybe I can actually get them back in some
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.240]   sort of a digital format later on.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.520]   And the live scribe is exactly which I have is exactly what I want on an iPad.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.840]   You know, like I just want that experience that I have with the live scribe without the
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.120]   paper part and the pen part.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120]   Hmm.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120]   Interesting.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:19.480]   Let's do a couple more stories and we're going to get your picks of the week.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.840]   Apple will be at Book Expo to promote iBookstore.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:28.240]   It's the first time Apple's appeared at the big, this is, it's not book fair, but it's
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.720]   one of the big book shows, right, Andy?
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.720]   How's iBookstore doing?
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.720]   I don't know.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.600]   It's so crappy.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.320]   I mean, in terms of selection, I like it's in the face.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.120]   I want it.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.000]   The quality of the experience is better, in my opinion, than my Kindle app.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.840]   But it's just I can never find the books that I want.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.920]   I think the iBookstore has two big problems.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.560]   One is that selection that just doesn't have that slam.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.600]   It doesn't have the idea that I'm going to go to the store.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.960]   And if this book I want is not available in the store that I know it's simply not available.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.520]   It's no, I should have gone to the Kindle store to begin with.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.200]   And the second problem is that you know for a fact that all these books that you're buying
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.320]   and I can buy hundreds and hundreds of dollars for the books a year will only ever be readable
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.920]   on Apple devices.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:18.280]   And I know that Amazon is absolutely agnostic and ecumenical when it comes to device independence
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.680]   that they're going to essentially any device that I will ever have will at some point have
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.920]   a Kindle client's, slants, it's not made by RAM, of course.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.680]   But I will always have the $100 book reader.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.760]   I'll be able to read it on my $1000 notebook.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.480]   I'll be able to read it on my $500 iPad.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:37.760]   There's very, very little upside to me to buying anything from the iBook store.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.960]   I books is also inconvenient in that one of the great things about the Kindle besides
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.120]   it being platform agnostic is that if I'm just walking down the street and someone mentions
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.640]   a book to me, I can go to the Amazon Kindle store on my phone and do it.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.320]   Or if I'm sitting at my desk and I somebody recommends a book to me, I just go to Amazon
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.520]   and Safari or Chrome on my Mac with the iBooks.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.920]   I have to launch the iBooks app on my iPad or my phone and do it.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   It's not that ubiquity of being on every different device, but it's also not available to access
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.040]   either even through iTunes or the web.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.600]   Well, I know what we were going to talk about.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.680]   iPhone rumors, the 4S.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.680]   I don't know what they are.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.680]   What are the rumors?
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.120]   It's going to have a little bit teeny, weenie bit bigger screen.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:25.520]   It's going to go edge to edge, I guess, on the phone won't be the bezel be smaller.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.520]   Was that it?
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.720]   Yeah, I think the screen's bigger, but the phone is the same size.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.720]   Right.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.920]   And then it's going to have the, I think they said it's going to have a teardrop design
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.040]   where the back is going to have an angle to it, I guess.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.120]   They're calling it the unicorn teardrop design.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.120]   It's very exciting.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.120]   Exactly.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.120]   That joke.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.120]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120]   That was it.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.960]   I mean, the only thing that I think you know is funny, Leo.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:51.200]   The only thing people know that it's going to have is it's going to have an A5 chip like
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.520]   the iPad 2 hats, which is going to be great because now that I have an iPad 2, my iPhone
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.520]   4 is so slow.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.720]   You notice that?
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:00.720]   I noticed it.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:04.520]   Oh, I noticed it all the time now, which drives me nuts because up until three weeks ago,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.920]   three or four weeks ago, when I got my iPad 2, my iPhone 4 is the fastest thing ever.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.880]   It's funny how relative it is.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.120]   I think that I know I think the speed hit is for me on the iPhone is the idea that it's
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:19.880]   this tiny little keyboard, this tiny little screen that I still have to navigate and you
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.520]   could give me an i7 processor and it would still be a lot slower than the iPad.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.440]   I've never noticed a speed difference between those two.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.800]   You could type fast on the iPad, Andy.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.800]   Using the virtual keyboard, I can get about 40 to 50 words per month.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   Wow.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.800]   Oh, I can get that on the iPhone.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.360]   I can't type for anything on the iPad though.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.080]   I have to use this Bluetooth keyboard.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.960]   I actually find it easier to type on the iPhone.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:47.040]   Like if I'm sending back to people, emails, it's a funny thing is that I'm like, oh, I
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.240]   rather just do it on my iPhone than always really long.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.400]   Do you use some typing or tap with your four finger?
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.960]   I do tap with my finger.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.960]   Tap.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   I just have an index finger.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   Two thumb jockeys, my friend.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   This is the way I do it.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.960]   Two thumbs.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:00.960]   That I can't do very well.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.960]   Really?
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.960]   It does seem like that.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   It does seem like it.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.680]   People with your flared trousers and your text messaging and your Myspace.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:11.120]   Ah, you kids in your two thumbs.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.520]   Us generation Xers, we were built into it.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.280]   We grew up with a different way.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280]   We think we don't connect.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:22.520]   So I'm just happy to have learned that there is a website called Stop It AT&T.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.820]   Stop It.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:32.740]   And they came up with an interesting job posting from Apple for a carrier engineer responsible
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:37.140]   for day to day technical interactions with one or more carriers to track down issues
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:43.940]   reported by the cell phone carrier, the job posting for Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:46.100]   Is there a carrier in Kansas City?
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.100]   Kansas City.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.740]   Oh, sprints in Kansas City.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:56.680]   Interesting, because as soon as this post went up on Stop It AT&T, the location of the job
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:02.280]   got moved to Copertino, which makes it even more suspect.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.520]   So I think that means we will probably see a sprint iPhone.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.760]   I mean, the big questions that I have around the iPhone is because most of the features
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.400]   I think are pretty well set.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.960]   I think that the issue is like I find myself wanting to get an Android or wanting to get
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.760]   a modem because I want 4G, you know, I want the 4G speed.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:24.180]   And I think that seeing it work on all the different carriers seems to be almost assumed
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.180]   at this point, I think.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:30.100]   And then once they unlocked the Verizon, the magic of Verizon to have the iPhone on two
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:33.780]   carriers in the US, I think from that point on, it was obvious that it's going to hit all
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:39.060]   four because up in, I'm pretty sure the US was the only country that was that had this
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:42.380]   sort of exclusive exclusivity agreement with AT&T.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.380]   Right.
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.020]   Every other country has multiple carriers.
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.180]   It made sense.
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:51.520]   And I think to get a CDMA device going, but once having done that, there's no reason not
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.920]   to be on sprint.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.920]   Right.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.760]   And T-Mobile, I guess too, since it's a GSM.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.760]   Right.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.520]   So I think that figuring that out, but I think the near field I think is going to be, it's
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.520]   got to be coming close.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.120]   Yeah, that's the other, we talked about earlier, the other big rumors that Apple's really going
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.640]   to move forward with NFC, which allows you to wave your phone at a terminal and charge
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.320]   stuff or other things.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:20.620]   I mean, I think that if they, if they released an iPhone with NFC 4G and a higher resolution
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.980]   camera, I think that's all they did.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.980]   I would, I would go.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:26.680]   I really just don't see them doing this NFC stuff.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.140]   And the reason I say, I think they'll do it eventually, but where do you, where can
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.500]   you actually use this in practice right now besides Google's campus?
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:38.400]   Like where's the actual, I mean, other than adding it to an Apple store, where else can
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.480]   I go and wave my phone and pay for stuff?
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:44.800]   I guess my question though is that with the iPhone market as big as it is, it's who would
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.400]   use it once it was available on every, on all these iPhones and millions of iPhones,
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.720]   people would start using it pretty quickly.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.400]   I think, I think that's the issue.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.600]   Well, there's a difference between selling something to phone consumers and selling something
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:01.480]   to everybody when you get to every CVS and every McDonald's and every Starbucks.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.800]   It's such an uphill climb.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.920]   I'm not sure if Apple really wants to get involved in that.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.200]   And the second thing is that I'm not even sure that you talk about generation X, not generation
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.080]   Y, but whatever it is, it comes underneath generation Y.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.680]   I think that's going to be the first generation to simply trust the fact that I'm going to
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   allow this device that's in my pocket, largely unguarded inside my pocket to be responsible
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.720]   for making direct debit transactions.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:29.520]   I mean, if you put, if the iPhone 5 had that feature, that's the first time I would make
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.640]   sure that my iPhone was in a case all times and B, make sure that case were made out of
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.120]   some sort of copper mesh.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.360]   It would be an a faraday cage.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.360]   It's a choice.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.360]   I'm not using it.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.720]   I'd be very, very concerned about the ability for someone to simply just basically surf next
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.960]   to it, brush past next to it and get access to that transponder.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.800]   Apple would do it very, very well, but I would not use that until I was, I'd really satisfied
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.240]   myself that there is almost impossible someone to commit fraud just by being in an elevator
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.240]   with me.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.920]   Well, if you feel that way, I have a feeling that the, that maybe consumers would feel
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.920]   that way.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:06.440]   Maybe NFC is just not going to happen because of that kind of a fear.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:09.520]   But I really think it's a generational thing.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.400]   If you look at the technical specs for a lot of these things, it's exceptionally difficult
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:19.160]   when they, when the, when there was a specification that a consortium was trying to promote three
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:24.640]   or four years ago, that if it's done the way that the specification demands it be done,
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.400]   it is actually exceptionally difficult on the level of it would take a government to be
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:34.440]   able to simply be somewhere within 10 feet of you and be able to cut to transact with
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440]   that ship.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:41.120]   But you know how these things get implemented that someone makes some suggestions somewhere
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.040]   saying, you know what, it would cost us $50 per transaction unit device in this store to
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]   make this secure.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:53.160]   But you know what, if we just use this, this, this, this, this two generation old hardware,
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.000]   that would drop down to $10 per unit and would really be just as secure, honestly.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.600]   So that's, that's where the fear comes from.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.560]   I think the danger is that, you know, the danger for any company that thinks that they
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.840]   can't pay attention to security is, all you have to do is say is Sony PlayStation Network.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.160]   Like, you know, like, you know, like if you don't think that it's going to, it's going
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.960]   to come back and get you, you know, the, the, the, it's not the, you know, the, the, the,
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:19.400]   the risk is really on their end of, of, you know, 14,000 people's personal information
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.880]   or a hundred thousand people's or a million people's personal information.
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:27.840]   That's, it is, you know, that's billions of dollars of damage, you know, that, that is,
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.760]   that the Sony is going to have to absorb.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:33.740]   And so the, you know, I think that that is where companies will, that's why they'll spend
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:34.740]   a little extra on security.
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:39.920]   I know we've been like, we, our e-commerce was, our original e-commerce was built by
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.600]   guys that worked at the Department of Energy.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.240]   And so the security guys.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.160]   And so like we didn't know, we really couldn't give you, get your credit card number.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.360]   Like we couldn't get, you know, like you would order it and it was so, it was so carded
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.560]   off from us, there was absolutely no way that we could actually get that.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.960]   And so the, and, and, but that is the, you have to kind of pay attention to it at that
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:58.960]   level.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:04.080]   But I think the other thing though, is that I think we are so much less secure than we
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.080]   think we are.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.800]   You know, like when my wife will not, you know, she won't do something, she wants to
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.320]   fax somebody the, the credit card number instead of talk to the, you know, like there's this,
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.800]   like your wife really, she's that smart.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.720]   She can get, she can get into all of this stuff, but I'm just kind of like, and then
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:20.280]   there's a person on the other end that, that, that writes it down, right?
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.360]   You know, you know, or, or there's a, or you're talking somewhere and you're giving out your
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.480]   credit card number or, you know, in, in, in one, I, you know, I ordered it.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.480]   Screwed no matter what.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.320]   I know that's the whole thing is it's just kind of like, you know, you obviously need
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.920]   to take precautions, but you need to also realize that as soon as you walk out your door,
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.440]   you know, it's, you're not secure.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.440]   Right.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.920]   And even there you're not really the future of the iPhone 4s or iPhone 5 or whatever
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.920]   it's going to be.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.120]   I don't think it's going to be so much that they're going to be showing off great new
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.120]   hardware.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.280]   They'll do some refinements to it, but I think the future is definitely going to be what
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.760]   they're adding in iOS 5, which I have no idea what they're adding.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.800]   But I think software is where you're going to see the, the highlighting a lot of stuff
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.920]   is all the new OS features because the hardware is good enough.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.600]   I mean, they can adjust in a few things and tweak a few things to make you look like you're
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.840]   buying something brand new.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.960]   But when they're, when they're highlighting things in the commercial, other than a couple
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.960]   of commercials, they're highlighting software.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.760]   I don't know if there's a huge story.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.600]   Other world computing, which sells a third party hard drives.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.880]   They, I bought their solid state drive upgrade from my Macbook Air, but very happy with it.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.520]   They really added a lot of storage space and they say speed, although it's so fast already,
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.520]   I couldn't really tell.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:34.400]   They say you cannot install third party hard drives in the new Sandy Bridge iMacs.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.000]   According to other world computing, Apple has altered the SATA power connector in such
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.560]   a way that removing the hard drive from the system or even the bay where it resides will
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:50.280]   cause the hard drive fan to spin at maximum speed forever.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:56.680]   So if you place a third party drive in there, even if it's the same model, the app was,
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:02.320]   was the computer was shipped with, it will fail the Apple hardware test.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.440]   You got to be brave to take apart an iMac, though.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.800]   I know I did it once.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.800]   I took this one up.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.480]   You have to use suction cups to pop off the screen.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.000]   You got to clink off the screen.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.920]   You've then you've got to actually replace the drive and then you've got to put the screen
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:18.080]   back on and make sure you don't get any dust inside of it.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.080]   I have to say though.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.080]   That big of a deal.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:25.880]   I brought my son's iMac 500 gig hard drive died and I having put a terabyte in this one
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.800]   decided I'm not going to take I saw calling to it.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.800]   I said no way I'm doing that.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.800]   I brought to the Apple store.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.360]   I said can I put a terabyte in?
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.480]   They said no we have to whatever comes out we use what we put in you cannot upgrade it.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.880]   So there are limitations to what you can do in the Apple store.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.480]   You're stuck with basically the same hard drive.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.480]   Hard drive to fail.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.240]   You're not going to replace it yourself and you're not going to be able to increase the
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.120]   capacity it's going to be an apple.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.040]   Although I have to say that the issue that I have now is that with Thunderbolt you know
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.800]   to get back to Thunderbolt with a Thunderbolt connection just do an external drive it's
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.960]   going to be actually faster than the internal drive.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   You know that's the.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.720]   That's that's really a typical apple response there if you if you tell them hey this is
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.200]   terrible I can't open up my iMac and do my own hard drive repair.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.720]   Their answer is why would you want to put a new heart?
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.200]   Why would you put a large hard drive in there too?
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.040]   We can give you a much faster hard drive just by plugging it in.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.720]   So it's got a beautiful screen.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.000]   There's the suction cups.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.960]   It's kind of like it's like mission impossible.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.600]   Yeah you need a spider man to get into it.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.680]   You lift this is calling did this I saw our do now once you get that screen up and don't
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.960]   drop it of course because it's glass but then the stuff is fairly accessible it's not such
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:42.880]   a big deal to do things like pull out the hard drive.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:50.240]   But it's it is nerve racking to use suction cups and lift that big panel out.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.000]   Can you still easily replace the drives in the MacBook Pros or have they.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.880]   Oh yeah made that no that's that's that's that's an easy.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.160]   As long as you got the right screwdriver and it's way too.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.120]   Yeah when I got my when I bought my new MacBook a few weeks ago first thing I did was crack
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.040]   it open and do some swap ins and swap out.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.560]   So what kind of ram ram and hard drivers still really easy to swap out.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.600]   I bought my new Mac Pro has a SSD drive in it is it a full size SSD or is it like that
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.920]   little car that they do in the air.
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.960]   I have a I have a MacBook Pro so it uses standard two and a half inch.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.320]   It's just a regular drive.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:27.600]   So basically anything anything you can put in a set of rails will fit in there.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.240]   I gotta I gotta put one in there because I'd like the I want a bigger drive 128 turns
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.240]   out to be too small.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.800]   Yeah and that's that's another that's another.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.680]   Can you still fit the system 128.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.480]   Oh yeah 64 is easy.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.560]   So I did that on my air and you're right it was very even on the air it was very easy
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.280]   because once you remove the aluminum it's all just sitting there.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.880]   Yeah it was very couldn't have been easier to to upgrade the hard drive on that.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.240]   I think I think for me the big thing is that I've just been slowly externalizing all of
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.240]   my data.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.480]   I mean I think that you know when you get into these SSDs and you know I just I've been
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.360]   really focused on not getting bigger internal drive drive really just having external you
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.520]   know access to it or servers that I'm gonna access or whatever travel purposes for me.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.440]   I just want a little more storage space for pictures and stuff as I travel about.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:13.000]   All right we're gonna take a break coming up our picks of the week Justin if you've got
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.680]   something it can be your software it's okay.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.440]   I've got things for you that are not my software although you could buy my software if you
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.280]   do like me that much.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.040]   I could tell you that both today and elements have been previous Mac break weekly picks
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.440]   even without you around.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.120]   And we thank you very much for that Leo.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.480]   You don't have to you don't have to worry about that we love both of your programs.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.960]   All right let's take a little break we'll come back actually Andy's got a little recommendation
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:41.920]   for us because it's audible time audible that bookstore where you can get over 70,000
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:47.920]   audio books just a wonderful collection it's my you know it's if I had to pick one favorite
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:53.760]   website it might well be audible because it saves my life pretty much all the time whether
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:59.520]   I'm in the car at the gym there's plenty of times I can't hold a book but I want to read
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.920]   and it's really brought reading back into my life which I love.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.440]   I got big like a big long flights and I'm I'm stocking up.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.440]   I'm ready.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.440]   You know it's every time every time before I leave that's my opportunity to go to audible
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.280]   and buy a bunch of books and you know what am I going to listen to on this flight what
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.560]   am I going to do on that flight.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:20.840]   Yeah really interesting stuff allow us to get this one it looks like the psychopath
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:27.920]   tested journey through the madness industry but before we do that let's I do need this
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:33.000]   however I did I do want to get Andy hasn't had a pick in quite a while and I want to give
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   him a pick.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.560]   Here's the deal you go to audible.com/macbreak you sign up for the gold account your first
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.760]   month's free your first book is free so what we're giving you here is a book you can get
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.360]   absolutely free you can cancel anytime the book is yours to keep forever and Andy who
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.880]   is a big audible listener always has something of interest to pick.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.360]   This is really an interesting one.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:55.720]   Yeah this is a good one because I mean a lot of people know that I'm a big audible listener
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:59.600]   read a lot of books and they're always asking me Andy has there ever been a really funny
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:06.520]   book written in Czechoslovakian about World War I and I say yes there has.
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:13.480]   It's a book called the Good Soldier Shrank and it's a really remarkable book written like
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:19.800]   the early 20s in Czechoslovakian but it's a satire it's a satire of war and culture
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:26.440]   and society in Europe at that time and it's about this this old like sort of worn out soldier
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:34.520]   got a strike who goes basically makes his way through the army through the culture through
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:39.760]   the the political situations of the time and as sort of like a lieutenant colombo where
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:46.040]   nobody is really sure if he's an idiot or if he is actually incredibly subversive because
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:51.080]   he's a sort of person where if the if the commissar asks him so how are things in the ranks you'll
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:55.120]   say oh it's terrible the you know that you know that oh it's okay except for when our
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.200]   captain is drunk and is going to see him seeing his mistress on the side and then there's
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.560]   a lot of people who are thinking no he's just stupid and thought and then there are people
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.080]   who are thinking no no we must we must detain him we must look at him he managed to get
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.200]   through all kinds of interesting situations but the thing is it's not just it's not there
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.240]   to make you think it's actually there to make you laugh.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:18.680]   He is the inspiration for Sergeant Schultz in Hoga's Heroes I think.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:23.800]   Yeah and you'll see a lot of you'll see a lot of echoes in mash and catch 22 basically
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:30.720]   every single military comedy about people who are not fitting in well with authority and
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:35.360]   basically authority being more or less incapable of dealing with some but some of that simple
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.360]   and direct character.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.360]   It's a classic thing isn't it?
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:40.520]   I mean the Sergeant Bill Co. I mean it's a classic thing.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.840]   I don't know why but I've read this many years ago.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.880]   I don't but seriously I mean it's not well known and I just and I loved it.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.320]   I really enjoyed it so I'm yeah and I gotta say that I was completely unaware about this
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.080]   book until three four weeks ago when I was in a bookstore and I saw the illustrations
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:03.240]   that are as closely linked with this book as Tineel's illustrations are with Alice's
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.400]   Adventures in Wonderland.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.000]   I recognized the good soldier Schweik immediately over your shoulder.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.760]   And so it was one and I am one of those people who's killing traditional bookstores because
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.560]   I could have spent nine dollars nine and a half dollars to actually buy this book in
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.560]   the bookstore.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.240]   No I took a picture of the cover with my iPhone.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.120]   That's what went back right from the iPhone.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:29.320]   Oh it's actually not only not only it's the ebook version is coming out later in this
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.440]   year later this year but I can get the audible version right now.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.240]   Okay I'll get the audible version and it's a great audible version because this guy you
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.960]   know sometimes sometimes you have readers who read the text in one tone of voice and
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:45.640]   then there's a guy who vell I'm going to talk this character sounds like this.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:50.720]   Well boys talk to this clip right now and the collect talks like this.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.200]   It doesn't get on your nerves at all it's actually a really really good performance for
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.120]   a very great number of hours.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:01.960]   I can't wait the good soldier Schweik S V E J K if you're looking for it.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:02.960]   Good luck with that.
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.960]   Search for the good soldier it does go from there.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.960]   There you go.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.960]   Don't even try to.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.960]   Jarrus love hostile.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.960]   I'm sure you're not going to get the author either.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960]   No no.
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.120]   The good soul will probably get you there.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.120]   It does.
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.120]   That's how I found it.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.520]   Audible dot com slash Mac break sign up for the gold account.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520]   Get your first book free.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.720]   This could be one but there's so many other choices.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.760]   Best sellers business classics.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:27.520]   Young adult kids teens sci-fi and fantasy to.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520]   Oh wait a minute.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.840]   Fries English delight looks like there's some Steven Fry on here as well.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.840]   Audible.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:39.480]   Hmm audible dot com slash Mac break your first ones.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:44.320]   Free but I can guarantee you you won't stop it.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.400]   Audible dot com slash Mac break we thank you so much for their support.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.760]   Now it's time for our picks of the week.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:54.000]   I've got one that I don't know I'm going to start this time and I don't know.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.480]   If Andy's tried this or not I'm really going to defer to your judgment on this.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:04.800]   It was this is an example of me finding something on the app store that I said wow that sounds
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.480]   like something I could use.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.120]   We've talked a lot about Scrivener and I've used Scrivener for a long time.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:13.800]   There's a program that's been around for just about as long as Scrivener called Ulysses.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.440]   Are you familiar with that Andy?
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.000]   I don't believe I am.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.640]   It reminds me of Scrivener but they call it a semantic text editor.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:29.800]   They separate the content from the presentation.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.120]   So it's really good for screenwriters and novelists.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.520]   They've got a lot of formats.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.080]   It's very powerful.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.360]   Scrivener like ability to for instance save notes to save parts of your document to a
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.360]   larger document.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.440]   I particularly like the console mode.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:50.080]   If you're somebody who's easily distracted the console mode just gets everything away
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:56.640]   and off your desktop so you can type to your heart's content without being distracted.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.000]   So this is for the ADD among us.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.240]   It seems to be, it has crossly, it seems extremely powerful.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:07.120]   $40 is a very interesting program.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.320]   So I want to, it's Ulyssesapp.com.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.880]   You can't get a 20 day trial on the website if you want to know a little bit more about
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.240]   it and they have quite a few screencasts as well so you can get a sense of it.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.480]   It seems to be a very deep program.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.320]   I don't spend as much time writing as I ought to.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.460]   Maybe somebody like Andy would be better to review this but I think it looks kind of
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:28.460]   intriguing.
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:33.680]   I'm very curious what you think of it Andy.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:34.680]   Ulysses.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.680]   And it is on the app store.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.000]   It's been around since 2003.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.360]   This is the newest version which just came out 2.0.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:47.880]   Bookmarks, project templates, multiple notepads, fonts, colors.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:52.560]   And that screen console that I think is pretty cool.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:56.600]   Ulysses 2.0, if you want the free trial get it from Ulyssesapp.com.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.720]   Otherwise you can download it and buy it on the app store.
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:04.480]   That has the advantage of course of being then available for all your computers which
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.680]   is one of the things I like most about the app.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.680]   You're getting addicted aren't you?
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:13.400]   I from day one I said the app store will be such a compelling experience for both developers
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.720]   and users that it has the potential to completely take over the ecosystem and that's what
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.760]   I thought it was bad but you're still getting addicted.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:24.240]   Yeah I was right it's fantastic it's too good.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.560]   That heroin is going to be so it's heroin.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.560]   Oh it's really good.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:30.960]   I actually be curious what Justin has to say about that but before we do let's ask you
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.480]   for your pick of the week.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.960]   I am mind pretty self-serving.
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.960]   It's your software?
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.600]   It's Pixacore.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.560]   We have a new app that MediaFly built for us.
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.520]   So MediaFly built an app for our podcast.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.520]   For the iPhone.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.520]   So have you seen these?
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.520]   I have not.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.520]   MediaFly is working with MediaFly and.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.760]   They do our stuff too.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:56.560]   So they built this little app for us that just lets you very easily see our Mac Breaks
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.560]   and our other shows.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.480]   So we're going to have to dim it down.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:04.560]   It's great you hit that and so it's a simple application that just lets you pop in.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:08.280]   You can hit play on any of them and it's just going to go ahead and it's going to stream
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.280]   it.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.280]   It's cool and there you go.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.280]   It's a video as well as audio.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.280]   Yeah that's cool.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.400]   So it's video on audio and it's just a nice great little application that's going to be
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:16.400]   using a lot more of that.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.520]   We've got a lot of new podcasts coming out this summer.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520]   I like these.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:24.640]   You know we're really happy to be working with MediaFly because not only do they do
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.840]   these apps but they get us on the Roku box and popcorn hour and Visios and so forth.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.600]   That's what got us into the conversation.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:34.680]   And this is just something that they you know and because it's what's cool is you they're
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.840]   very flexible as well.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   What is it?
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.840]   You have unfinished?
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840]   Oh that means I haven't listened to them all.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:40.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.840]   And preloaded those are the ones I've downloaded.
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:42.840]   Got it.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:43.840]   Got it.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.840]   Got it.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:45.840]   I'm going to go through this together for us.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.480]   It's just the beginning but if you want to see some of the if you want an easy way to
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:51.240]   see and we're going to add a lot more to this.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.800]   We've updated it's free.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.920]   So so go up to the iTunes store and download it.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:56.920]   It's very cool.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.920]   It's a fun little way to to enjoy.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:02.080]   And if I just search for Core PXEL Core PXEL C-O-R-P-S I'll be able to find it.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.080]   Yep.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.880]   Very good.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.120]   It is time for your Justin Williams.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.880]   What is your pick of the week?
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.880]   Okay I'm going to go for an iPhone app this week and it solves one of the problems that
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:18.100]   I have with the iPhone platform itself in that I am dependent way too much on iTunes
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.600]   for syncing things.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.320]   And one of the things that I'm always downloading and wanting to sync is podcasts such as this
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.120]   fine podcast we're on right now.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:28.520]   And so there's an app called Instacast for the iPhone.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.720]   Oh I've been hearing a lot of good things about this.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.520]   I mean it's a Buck 99.
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.200]   So you download Instacast.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:38.880]   You can search and it has pretty much every podcast that I had in my iTunes library showed
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.800]   up pretty easily in the Instacast search.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.680]   You click on it, you subscribe and then whenever you launch the app it'll download your new
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.680]   episodes.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.000]   You can listen to them in there.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   You can keep an archive of old episodes.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.520]   And it's a really really good experience.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.560]   One of the problems that I've always had with iPhone apps that don't shy too far away
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:00.920]   from Apple's standard widgets set is that they look really bland and kind of vanilla.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:04.720]   And Instacast is one of those apps that has taken it kind of like what Tweety did back
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.800]   in the day.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:10.640]   It's taken the default interface elements that Apple has had added a few tweaks to it
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.080]   that looks like it's a naturally implementation and it's done a really good job of that.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:16.640]   So I'm really enjoying this app.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.440]   It's two bucks which is insanely cheap for something that's so powerful.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.440]   So check it out.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.720]   And it solves a problem that I've found on the iPhone which is you can't subscribe to
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.400]   podcasts natively on the iPhone.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.080]   You have to subscribe on the desktop, it gets downloaded to iTunes and you have to
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.320]   sync it up.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.480]   And then when you're traveling you can't sync a new podcast because your iTunes library's
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.480]   back at home.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:40.320]   So I'm really looking whenever I download my podcast when I come out to San Francisco
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.320]   for WWDC.
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:45.720]   This is going to solve a problem that I've had with not being able to copy new stuff onto
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:46.720]   my device.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:47.720]   Cool.
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:50.400]   So what's your what's your take on the app store?
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.240]   Oh, I love the app store.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240]   Of course.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.240]   No, I've gone through.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.240]   I've gone here.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.240]   Here's the thing though.
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.240]   I've gone through phases.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.600]   When if app store first came out I was just be I was frustrated by it.
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:01.760]   I thought it was a terrible experience.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.440]   Are you speaking as a developer or as a user?
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.360]   As a developer I even as a developer I've been went so far as to sell off my original
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:10.720]   iPhone business and say I'm done with this to hell with it.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:13.120]   I'm going back to the back entirely.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:16.840]   And then I finally just it was too alert and to build stuff for the iPad that I came
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.680]   back and they've definitely.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.880]   I'm talking about this desktop.
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.800]   I'm talking about the desktop app store though.
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.240]   Oh, that's not what I eat.
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.240]   That's all I use now.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:31.280]   See this was the conversation was it's so attractive from both point of view of users and for you
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.240]   too obviously you were an Apple staff pick for today on the app store.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.400]   In fact both your apps are on the app store right elements is on it too.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:45.520]   I feel like it kills the ecosystem for you know just apps you download from a website.
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:49.240]   In a way it does in that it's frustrating that there's no trials but in the case of today
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.960]   I'm still offering it on both platforms.
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:56.840]   But as a user I really hesitant to buy anything outside of the app store ecosystem now because
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.920]   it is so easy just to updates now.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.920]   Exactly.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:03.080]   Like for instance there was an app I think it's called Carousel which is a new Instagram
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:07.560]   client for the Mac and it's only available through their website and it's like I think
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:11.120]   it's 15 bucks but I'm more than willing to give them 15 dollars but I'd rather give
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:15.200]   it to them through the Mac app store so that I can handle the updates through there which
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.200]   is that's why I don't.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.200]   That's why I do it.
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:21.440]   I want to have the updates to go through there but then only stuff that Apple approves can
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.880]   be sold there and that's kind of my problem with it.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.280]   I even think for me as someone who is constantly testing a lot of different laptops and hardware
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.880]   and everything else just being able to sit there and download across anything that I'm
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.160]   signed into and I'm just like.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.480]   I saw my purchases are all in one place.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.640]   Although what's going to happen is this gets longer and longer and longer right?
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.800]   There's no way to remove this.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:44.320]   I cannot right click on this and remove it.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:47.080]   This list of purchases I'm talking about.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.280]   It's going to be too long to be the reorder.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:52.120]   I mean I think that you and I buy a lot of apps.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.680]   I bet everybody does eventually.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:54.680]   But I have to deal with the same thing.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:00.000]   I feel like the way to deal with hundreds of apps for your iPhone and iPad is painful
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   and iTunes.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.440]   I mean I still do it but it's turning them on and off.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.200]   I have a bunch of different iPhones and iPads and so turning them all for the kids or whatever
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:10.120]   and I'm trying to turn them all on, turn them all off and it's painful.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:13.720]   I'm just mostly worried about the fact that Apple, this just means Apple has total dominance
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:17.120]   and gets to approve every app ultimately.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:21.360]   I'm not worried about it yet but if they did get to the point where they stopped allowing
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.880]   third party apps to be installed outside of the app store, that's when I would be concerned.
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.480]   I don't think they could do it.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.480]   I don't think they can.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.080]   No, I don't think they will.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:33.800]   I just don't think it will be the fact it will become that way by just default because most
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.360]   users will not even bother.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:38.560]   They'll just say, "If it's not in the app store, it doesn't exist."
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:42.800]   So you can build your store in the warehouse district but no one's going to be there.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.160]   That's what really concerns me.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.680]   It's the suburbification of computing.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:53.000]   All right, Andy and I go, "You're pick of the week."
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.800]   This is an app for the iPad that I wanted ever since I heard there was going to be something
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.800]   called an iPad.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:58.800]   It is Omni-Outliner.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:02.920]   For the iPad, yes.
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:10.440]   And I've got the sample Omni-Outliner documents here because my Omni-Outliner on the Mac is
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:16.200]   so important to my day-to-day business that I can't show you my Omni-Outlines because
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.320]   that's the outline to all the books I'm working on, every idea I've had over the past three
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:24.800]   or four months notes that I take during meetings, during briefings.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.880]   It's just, it's not just an outlining app.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:34.840]   It's so flexible that it really is kind of an app that lets you build a solution to any
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:39.120]   problem that you have that involves collecting and sorting and managing information.
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:42.600]   So I've been thinking about buying it but I was going to wait till I heard from you,
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:43.600]   Andy.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.600]   I'm so jealous of that app.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:45.600]   It's so well done.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.600]   It's insane how good it is.
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:54.200]   And it's really such a difficult nut to crack because when you have the Omni-Outliner for
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.920]   the desktop, it's a very, very elegant, simple and powerful app.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:00.720]   But you have a mouse interface, you have all these windows, you have all these elements.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.240]   How do you solve the problem of putting all of that simplicity on a screen where you always
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.840]   have to be tapping things?
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:09.360]   And so there are a lot of really nice little solutions to this.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:15.800]   They put like the outlines, the dots and the arrows and the pointers to indicate for
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.440]   hoisting and collapsing things.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:22.920]   That actually has its own column on the left side here.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:28.480]   But really there's about a 10 minute or 15 minutes learning curve while you figure out
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:31.680]   how you translate everything that you would normally do with a keyboard and a mouse to
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.360]   how you do it with gestures here.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:38.240]   But after that, it really is just double tap on anything to start typing.
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.400]   This is a new line.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:46.280]   And then if I wanted to indent that, here's a tap, here's a button here for, I should
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:51.600]   probably zoom in here so you can see, actually see what I'm doing.
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.840]   So I mean, it's just very, very simple to write outlines, continue to edit and move things
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.840]   along.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:34:59.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.280]   It will support a million different, basically any sort of thing you want to do.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:09.080]   There's also, so, and if you're not just doing outlines, if you're just using it for things
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.040]   like tabular data, here it is and...
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.840]   I have a zoom out a little bit.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.840]   Believe me, someday I'll have my own, my own Skype of source, I can figure this things
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.840]   out.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:23.520]   But here we have a big list of tabular data where it's being used more like a database
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:25.480]   than anything else.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:30.520]   And given that you've got a limited amount of screen real estate here, it's smart enough
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:34.680]   to know that the first column, if you have multiple columns in your outline, is probably
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.920]   going to be the important one.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:40.200]   But if there's too much information to scroll it off, it will simply keep that first column
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:46.760]   in place to continue to scroll off and see every single item in the table that's related
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.720]   to each item in here.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:51.400]   It'll deal with long, long, long...
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.720]   You can have items that are long, long, long notes instead of single lines of text.
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:57.760]   You can have pictures as items, you can have URLs as items.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:02.160]   It supports Web dev, it supports iDISK, it supports exporting iTunes and email.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:03.160]   They tell me that...
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:07.000]   Excuse me, they say on their site that Dropbox support is something that they're actively
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000]   looking at.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.240]   I hope they're very actively looking at it.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.240]   But...
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.520]   And it's completely file compatible with the original Omni-Outlander.
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.600]   There are some features in the desktop version that because you're running it on iOS and
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.960]   on macOS that simply aren't supported.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.960]   But other than that, pretty much every single outline that I have going on my desktop, I
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.480]   will simply copy straight over.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:33.160]   Now I have all this data and all this information that I run my life, my business on just right
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.160]   here.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.160]   It really is...
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.160]   I almost...
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.760]   Within the first hour, I'd elevated it to an essential app because once again, you
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:45.800]   can't really prepare for every single app you need and every single situation you're
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.800]   going to be.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:51.120]   If you have Omni-Outlander on your iPad, there's an excellent chance that you can simply build
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:56.160]   the data collection or the data manipulation or the calculation app that you need just by
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.600]   expressing it as an outline.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.720]   And with the features that you got here, you pretty much have all the tools you need to
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.160]   get that thing going.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:09.000]   So 20 bucks, which is not cheap by iPad standards, but it really is a no-brainer purchase for
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.600]   someone, at least for me it was a no-brainer purchase.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.200]   Oh my goodness, I was just waiting to hear.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.200]   That one.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:16.600]   There's three apps I use on my iPad predominantly.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.640]   One is my own and two of them are from Omni.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.360]   I use Omni-Outliner, which has just come out, but it's already become so integrated into
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.600]   my workflow.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:27.200]   And then Omni-Focus for the iPad is by far my favorite version of Omni-Focus.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.200]   It's fantastic.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.360]   So those guys really understand the iPad.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.160]   And like I said, I'm insanely jealous of how talented they are.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.600]   I wish if I had that Google $100,000, I might be able to afford to be that awesome.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.600]   I have to...
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.400]   I do all of my diagram in an Omni-Graphon.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.400]   I just have to...
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.400]   People ask what I'm like.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.400]   I think an Omni-Graphon.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:47.800]   Like I just think that's how I plan everything.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:50.600]   I buy all their apps and never figure out how to use them really.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:51.600]   That's my problem.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.280]   But look, is it on the right side here?
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.400]   Dang, it's not.
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:56.400]   But they've...
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:00.400]   They're just so clever in figuring out ways to make things work.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.840]   You can either put...
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.720]   When you're designing an iOS app, you can either decide that, well, for every feature
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.960]   I'm going to add another button to the interface, or you can come up with clever things.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:14.360]   I want you to look at that side of the screen for the button that will add a new
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.800]   line.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:20.480]   If you tap and hold, it brings up actually a little palette of extra buttons.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.640]   So if you want to simply say, "Actually, no, I want to add something above this," or,
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:27.800]   "No, I want to add something that is already indented for the next thing."
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.840]   You don't have to tap and then move it a second time.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.600]   You simply tap and then stroke it a little bit.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:32.600]   Love that.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.600]   Really, really smart.
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.000]   There is a small learning curve.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.040]   There are some things I didn't understand until I watched the video that was on the site.
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:42.960]   But five minutes later, I really felt like I was 98% up to speed on this.
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.120]   So good stuff.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.120]   And this is just in.
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:49.800]   Noteworthy, not a new application, just a new font.
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.800]   Thank you.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.800]   Thank you.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.800]   I'm still in business, guys.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:56.600]   This is why we don't do breaking news on this show.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:59.200]   We get it wrong almost every time.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:05.600]   This just in, noteworthy, according to the iOS web log, is a font you'll find in iOS
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:08.480]   4.3 replacing chalkboard.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.800]   It is better looking when chalkboard.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:14.120]   Okay, so that's one fewer thing that we'll be hearing about than WWDC keynote.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:17.360]   I don't know what they're going to be talking about now, but now that this whole font situation
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.720]   has been blown, maybe we'll have a little in-joke about it.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.160]   You already know about noteworthy.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:26.200]   Andy and I go, "Is that the Chicago Sun-Times?"
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.800]   I just want to say one thing about Andy's presentation here.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:30.800]   I know.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.800]   He's so good.
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:37.400]   But we need to have, we need someone needs to get a couple clips over the last year or
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.400]   two.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.400]   How it's improved.
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:42.400]   Every week now, there's something else tweaked.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.960]   The lighting gets a little bit better.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.800]   Are you tinting the windows right now?
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:48.800]   Well, I'll see.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.800]   This is raining out there.
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:51.800]   No, this is a light target.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.920]   Yeah, I actually, I went to Amazon and say, "No, no.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.600]   I really had it with all these blow-not windows.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.600]   I'm going to spend $50 or $80 for that special tinting."
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.280]   Then I decided, "Or I can go to Target and buy this sort of like pantyhose material,
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.600]   pantyhose material like curtains.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.600]   I can put it back.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.000]   They'll get the exact same thing.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.600]   I've got blackout curtains on that window over here."
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.600]   It's just, it's just a case of like week after week's like, "Oh God, that looks like crap."
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.360]   But I feel like, I feel like now we're going to this point where every week we see something
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.360]   new.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.360]   His standards are better than ours.
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.360]   That's the problem.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.360]   Thank you.
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.360]   Well, he does.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:29.760]   I got, no, but realize that like you guys, when you get into the new studio, the first
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:31.440]   show is going to be brilliant.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.360]   With me, realize it took me like a year of like just by the braille method, feeling my
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:36.360]   way around.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.280]   If you're listening to a thousand ways, you could possibly set up and do lighting.
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:44.280]   I've worked through number 778 and now I'm starting to get to the point where, "Okay,
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:48.080]   so we've tried, we've eliminated all the ways of doing a crappy show."
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.080]   I love it.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.080]   And is that your picture?
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.080]   Is that Grand Central Station?
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.080]   What is that picture?
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:58.000]   No, that is a picture I shot with the GoPro, the still video mode, the still photo mode.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.760]   That's the grand entrance to the Boston Public Library, believe it or not.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:02.760]   Awesome.
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.040]   It's up on my, up on my Flickr feed.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:08.480]   It's using the GoPro's 5 megapixel photo mode as a really wide angle lens.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.400]   It's one of my favorite pictures for the past couple of months.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:15.720]   Because it's such a, if you really, if you come to Boston and you have a short, if you
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:20.480]   have one day to go devote an hour or two to visit the Boston Public Library, it is a,
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:26.040]   just as Fenway Park is a cathedral baseball, I can't think of any American library that
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:28.600]   is even more of a cathedral for learning.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.640]   And I include the New York Public Library too.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:35.440]   The Boston Public Library just kicks the butt of the New York Public Library, just has a
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.840]   beautiful building to come in and read.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:38.840]   Obviously.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:42.000]   I just, I don't know why, but I'm thinking of the Simpsons where Homer rings a part to
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.480]   a library and he says, "Wow, what's this?"
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:48.920]   It's a library son, a place where bums go to bathe.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.680]   Sorry about that.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.720]   Didn't mean to bring down that.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:56.960]   Magnificent facilities of the Boston Public Library.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.520]   Marble sisters.
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:01.600]   Where bums go to bathe?
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:07.040]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is ahead of the pixelcorpixacore.com for the giddled of multimedia artists, learning
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:11.200]   and working together, pixelcorp.tv for their great podcasts.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:14.920]   Don't forget to find them on iPhone now with that MediaFly app.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:15.920]   That's very cool.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:16.920]   You know, having some fun.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.880]   We're going to have, I can't wait until the new studios open.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:19.880]   That's all I can say.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:20.880]   Yep, they're moving in with us.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.760]   They'll be on the other side of the bricks.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.760]   Yes.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.560]   They're on the inside of the bricks.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.040]   And Justin, I'm so glad you joined this.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:32.200]   Justin Williams from secondgearsoftware.com.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:33.600]   Everybody should run.
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.600]   Not run people.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:35.600]   Run.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:36.600]   Run.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.600]   To the app stores.
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.600]   And get text from me on the elements.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.600]   Great stuff.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.600]   We really appreciate you.
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:43.000]   My favorite iPad word processor is elements.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000]   Yep.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000]   It's just beautiful.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.280]   And maybe someday I will actually ship elements to someday.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.440]   Love to see both face someday.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:52.880]   But until then, still a very lovely word processor.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.880]   Thanks, your feed.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:56.960]   One day, Andy, I will share with you the pain and suffering that is.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:58.960]   I'm using rich text on iOS.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:42:59.960]   Yes.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.560]   Thank you for being here, Justin.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.560]   We really appreciate it.
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.560]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.560]   We do Mac break weekly as soon as we can get everything working, which usually round
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:10.160]   two, three, three, and a second.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.160]   The first eastern.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.800]   If you're coming in live, the first half an hour is the best part.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.600]   The part where we tear our hair out.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.600]   We're all in.
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:20.400]   You see Leo working on the, you know, you know, it's.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.400]   Listen.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.880]   Do tune in.
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:26.480]   It starts the Mirth and Merriment starts at 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.160]   Live.twit.tv every Tuesday morning.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.160]   It's my first show of the week.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.120]   That's why I'm a little discombobulated.
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:34.680]   You guys, I don't know what your excuse is.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.040]   And don't forget we are selling bricks.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:41.880]   You can have your name engraved on the new wall of fame, wall of honor in the Twit brick
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:43.400]   house right there in the front door.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.400]   You come visit your brick.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.160]   I find out more at bricks.twit.tv.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:48.160]   Thanks.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:49.160]   Join us.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.840]   You know you want one.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.800]   You know, get two.
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:53.800]   Get two.
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:54.800]   They're small.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.280]   Thanks for joining us now.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:43:59.480]   Get back to work.
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.680]   Break time is over.
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:10.840]   [Music]
