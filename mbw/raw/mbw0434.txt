[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Welcome to the Real Report year.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Yes, you could tell by the fact that I am an elf on the shelf
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   that this is our holiday edition.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Woo-hoo!
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   That means we're going to have some of the best clips
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   from 2014, coming up, starting off with all 2014.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   That was the year that I got my brand new Mac Pro,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   and I just couldn't stop touching it.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I just couldn't stop the corner radius.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Oh, index of refraction of the paint glass.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I'm just going to say, this is the last Mac Pro I'll ever own.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You look like you're fondling Mr. Bigel's worth.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I'll never leave you.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   For the record, there are five different
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   witticisms that I've thought of that said,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   "No, we better not say that."
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I like doing this show, and I like twin existing,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and if I said one of those things,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   which seems to be true anymore.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I think that what really, and by the way,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   please don't send me emails saying,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   "You could buy a keyboard and mouse for $15."
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I know.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I have plenty of keyboards in my's.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I'm not just joking.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I do have to say, and a final word on this.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   For whatever, it's way overpriced.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Nobody needs a power, blah, blah, blah.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   This is a computer you literally can fall in love with.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Apple does that so well.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I'm kind of...
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It's like owning a Lamborghini.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I'm kind of fond of it.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I don't know.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I think I would get more day-to-day enjoyment
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   from a Mac row than a Lamborghini.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   In my opinion, I'm probably being...
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I sit down every night.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I sit down and go, "What am I going to do with you?"
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And I open the browser and I go to Facebook.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It's depressing.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I'm not likely to send a Mac row into a ditch
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   by the side of a road.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   That's one thing to do.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   How could I send a computer PC?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I'm not using it as a...
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Believe it or not, the Xbox One is a perfect home theater PC.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And I'm using that as my home theater PC.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And that's fine.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's too inexpensive.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   You need a much more expensive.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   The real truth is I have absolutely zero need for this.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   But I do love it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It's something about it.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You just kind of fall in love with it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It's hard to describe.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   That's always been one of Apple's strengths.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's not a trivial thing either.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You're saying it's okay, Andy?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   No, I'm saying do not...
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   There are objects in that very room you're sitting in right now
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   that are capable of returning your love in a significant way
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   that would pay off for you to come run.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   As opposed to make forcing you to go find a box of wet naps
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and get that stuff off your Mac Pro.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm just saying that there are so many laptops out there
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   that I think are really, really great.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I really like my new Retina MacBook.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   But I also like these $250 Chromebooks.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And whatever the advantages of a Chromebook are,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   when you take it out of the box, you don't feel like,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   "Oh, man, that is manifestly the weapon of a king."
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   This is a beautiful thing.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I feel like...
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I feel like the Fondelcam.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Welcome to the cinemax.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's 1 a.m.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Coming up at 1.10.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Look, the reason we get into this business for a lot of us,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   certainly it was for me, is a love of technology,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   a love of...
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Apple's taught us a love of design.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   They're not speak its name.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And every once in a while, an object comes out.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   It's a really fetishistically beautiful.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And they're rare.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And when they come out, you want to celebrate the best of an honor.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   This is...
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   There's a reason why so many of the people on this show
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   and listening to the show have a G-4 Mac cube.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Exactly.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I had that...
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   That is not in storage, not been given away.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   It's just a beautiful object that gives them pleasure
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   to simply have it on the shelf somewhere.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   That's not an easy thing for tech company to...
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Okay, now you're freak...
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You're just giving me out a little bit, you know?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I shall call her...
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Her.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   If next week we finally put a set of wax lips on the side of that.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I might have to sit out a couple of shows.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   No, it's just going to be fun for me, Matt, forever,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and staying young, you know.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   It could be my pillow wife.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   All right, enough of this, sillyness.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It is, you mentioned...
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You know what we ought to do?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I do have to admit, because it was...
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   We should go back and look at when they first announced it
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and then have all of these, all of our comments.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I completely... I freely admit, I mocked it.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Certainly, I don't want to do this at all.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I thought it was stupid.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I said, "Who's going to want to buy this?"
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It starts at 3,000, but by the time you equip it properly,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   you're talking 10 grand, all of that's still true.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And in fact...
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And then you saw it.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And then I saw it, and it is.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It's like...
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Through the heart music.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Is it in a change?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's like if you knew that falling in love with Scarlett Johansson
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   would cost you a lot of money, and a lot of heartbreak,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and that eventually George Clooney would come along
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   and steal her away, but you still...
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Matt Crow, you complete me.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Matt, Matt...
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   [music]
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Here's Leo's.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Just...
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   What?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Well, you've got the gaffer tape out.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Just cover up the webcam on your notebook
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   before you have your alone time with the Mac Pro.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Whoa!
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You never know.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You know what's great about the Mac Pro?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   No webcam, so no one can see you loving your computer.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   995 per minute.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Not available in the district of Columbia.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Web my Apple.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   [music]
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   [music]
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Oh, man.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Somewhere there's an Apple engineer feeling really uncomfortable.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   He's like...
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I never planned that.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I love that music.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   By the way, pardon me for this interruption.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   David Hakka-Bolle is a photographer
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   who's done a set on Flickr called Mac-Turnity.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I think we should just sit back and enjoy these pictures of David and his Mac Pro.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   He's having my baby.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   What a wonderful way.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   [music]
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Just a never-feel sunlight on your face.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Did you ever know that you're my hero?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You know everything, everything, everything I'd like to be.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I wish, for those of you listening to the audio stream,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   you could see these lovely pictures.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   A Mac Pro-Poudoir photo.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I thought my fondle cam was going too far,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   but apparently here's a man who loves his Mac Pro even more.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I'm a illegal in several states.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Can I take a marry a Mac Pro in a California item?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I got 20 bucks that says that the moisture sensor inside that is very, very much red.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Taking off the headphones for a while.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   But I think I always think about what...
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Just keeps on going.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Full multi-core action.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   It's just 1995.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It's the hippie headband that throws me off his...
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   The headband's a little weird.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Just what I'm about to sort of say, okay, to each his own, it's the headband.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   The back pro Jesus turned water into...
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And at this moment, how many hundreds or thousands of people watching this are saying,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   "That guy got his Mac Pro."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Damn it!
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Where's my Mac Pro?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Damn you all the hell!
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   [sigh]
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   All right.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Johnny and I, how are you feeling about yourself right now?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   You feeling a bit about yourself right now?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Can't innovate my ass.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I can never unsee that.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Credit to David HB on Flickr.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Davin, not David.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Davin HB.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Davin.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   How cable bowl.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   B-O-L if you want to see these pictures.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I think you're going to give him.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   You may flee to Flickr and see them all.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   We do love that Mac Pro.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   How are you coming up?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   It wasn't the only product that shipped from Apple.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   This year, I think you know what I'm talking about there.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   There was a little one in there.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Really big one.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Before we get to that though, I'd like to tell you a little bit about our sponsor this week.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Personal capital.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I love personal capital.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   We're all in the same boat.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Planning for retirement.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Planning for a really big purchase like a house.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Just making sure that our money is working for us.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   You put a lot of work into earning that money.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Don't waste it away.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Don't let it fritter away.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Use personal capital to see how your money is doing, where it's going.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   If you're overpaying in fees, if you're paying too much for financial advice, I love personal capital.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Best of all, it's easy to set up and it's absolutely free.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Visit personalcapital.com/macbreak.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Personal capital, I have it written right here on the shelf.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Personalcapital.com/macbreak.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   You can set it up.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   It'll take you a few minutes.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Get all your accounts in there.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   You're checking your savings, your investments, your mortgage, your assets.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   For one thing, for the first time ever, at least it was for me when I set it up, you'll know how much you're worth.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   You'll also see where your money is going.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   You'll see if you're overpaying in fees.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Personal capital will help you arrange your investments for maximum return at minimum cost.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I've got to tell you, this is the best thing you can do.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   It works on your desktop, your tablet, your phone.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   They even have an Android, a ward-winning Android Wear watch app, one of the very first.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   So you can see, you can get updates at any time how your money is doing.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Personalcapital.com/macbreak.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   This would be a 2015's here.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I know you made some New Year's resolutions.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I've got a few, but there's no resolution more important than making sure your money is earning.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It's keep that it's not being wasted.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   You worked hard to get it.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Make sure you use personal capital to keep track of it and make it do the work it needs to do so you can retire at a young age.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Personalcapital.com/macbreak.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You're going to love it.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Well, this was the year we got new iPhones, and wow, they really were new iPhones.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So another rumor, more rumors on the iPhone.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I think at this point, can we lock it down?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   There will be two iPhones, probably September.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   4.7 inch display on one 5.5 inch on another.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I don't see, is Apple really going to do a 5.5 inch iPhone?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Well, that's a departure for them.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   That's a new Apple.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   It is in the way it isn't.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   You talk about not just the sources of rumors, but the velocity of them and the directions they come from.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Although I would not have predicted even four months ago that Apple would have gone with two different larger screen iPhones.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Now, I'm really starting to believe that there's going to be a normal sized phone that's large than an iPhone.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And also one that's kind of like a pop tart.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I would never guess that.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   That is the one's indication of the...
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Kind of like a pop tart, ladies.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   The frosting on the pop tart is the sapphire.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   That's the only way to put it.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   And the great thing is, occasionally I have to go down to the store, buy some chocolate pop tarts, make the comparison.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   It doesn't taste as good.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I'm willing with that.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   This is the first thing I noticed with the Nokia 1520, because it looked very, very familiar.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   So I bought a box of pop tarts.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   It is exactly the size of one and one half pop tarts.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   You put one and one half pop tarts on top of it.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   You completely cover the foots.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   So you've blown the ratio, though.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   That can't be...
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   You can't.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   That's a long pop tart.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Nobody wants that.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Do you have an iPhone on you?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I do.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   This is a comparison, because I...
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   This is not an exact comparison, because...
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Here's...
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   This is an iPhone 5S.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Do you have the over the shoulder?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   That's the 4-inch screen.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   This is a HTC M8.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   That's a 5-inch screen.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So it's bigger than the 4.7 will be.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I don't have my Moto X.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   It's in the middle.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   It's in the middle.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And this is...
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Let's see, note 3.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   This is 5.7 inches.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   This is fairly close to what an iPhone 6 might look like.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   That is a jump of a...
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   It's a big question, though.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's like a big question for me there is that the note size...
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   The phablets have not sold in North America in any appreciable number.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   They've sold gangbusters in Asia, but they sold at a rather low price point.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   I don't think Apple's going to do low.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Give me that again, because then this is a pop tart.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   And...
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   The pop tart...
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   I don't want to work there if you've got pop tarts.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   The pop tarts...
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   The pop tarts...
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   On top, man.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   On top, man.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   It'll be 16.9, won't it?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   What if you had two pop tarts together?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Would that be the 6-inch...
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   That's the iPad mini.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   That's kind of the iPad mini.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And here's an air.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   So...
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Oh darn.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Well, I guess I'm going to have to eat that one.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   The air is more a sirely cake.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Would you like a pop tart?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Sure, yeah.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   I'll hand it over.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Yeah, we do have pop tarts.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   That's part of the employee benefit program we offer.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   They have sugar, coconut, pop tarts, and there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Not coming through.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   What?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I can't hear you.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   I've got a pop tart in my ear.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Holding it upside down, Jason.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   You're holding it wrong.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   The home button isn't working.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   They haven't solved that antenna problem on the pop tart.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   What the hell kind of flavor pop tart is this?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   This has got sparkles on it.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   You need a bumper of icing before you can get calls on that.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Icing bumper.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   They make...
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Okay, this is not a healthful snack.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   No, have you seen the calories in that thing?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   This is not a healthful breakfast.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   This is like as many calories as like a Big Mac, baby.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I don't know what I'm having for lunch.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Make sure you note that in your health app, Leo.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Wow.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I'm not even that.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   We just got the pop tart, the TV desk too.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Everybody gets pop tart.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Soooooo!
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Jason, push one towards the TV.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Push one towards the TV.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Who buys pop tarts for the staff?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Sorry.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Is that Debbie?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Is that Lisa's idea?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Debbie?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I think we bought them like six months ago and they've just been hanging around.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Oh, well that's a good thing about a pop tart.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   They keep for a long time.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Last forever.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   So let's talk about...
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   So Alex, you just have to recuse yourself.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Actually Alex, you're playing with everybody's...
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   You're our guinea pig, by the way.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   I know.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   You're our guinea pig because you haven't bought yet and are you like most of the United States of America and soon China and the rest of the world in a conundrum and a coundery?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   It is very upsetting for me.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   The whole thing is is that if the image optical image stabilization was on the small one, it would be a no brainer.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Let me just point out something real quickly.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   That I think is significant.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   These are identical except for size, right?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And now the pixels per inch are not, but it's not like you get more icons on the screen.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   You get an extra row, don't you know?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Looks like the same number rose may.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   No, this is not zoomed.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   This is standard.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Zoomed would take away a row as a matter of fact.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   A way until developers start targeting that screen.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Just like when the first iPad mini came out, it was just every single full-sized iPad app only like two hundred thousand dollars.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And then after a few months, people started targeting that user interface and making it better.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   So we're seeing that a little bit with some of the Apple made apps, but I think that we're going to really see this as an entirely new device platform.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And that's another really important point for today, which is many, many apps are not scaled properly at all.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So this is Google+, none of the Google apps were modified for the new resolution.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   So this is Google+, basically as it would have been on the 5S or any other phone.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   The scalers pretty good though, especially on the 5 plus because it's got so much such a high density.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   On the six, you'll see the little line wave sometimes because it's scaling it.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   But on the six plus, the density is so high, you can barely see this.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Yeah, but I got a point.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Okay.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   So again, look at this here.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   This is exactly you're seeing exactly the same thing.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   It's not likely you're using more of the screen at all.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   And so these are fairly, fairly big tech.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Now again, this is for an unmodified app.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   You're absolutely right.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   It will soon be better.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   But also if you have the app, go ahead.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   I'm saying if you have an app like the Kindle reader where you can adjust font sizes, suddenly you can make the font a lot smaller than you had on the, even on the regular six and still be nicely readable.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   So today it's even a good idea.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   I think in the future though, it's going to be even better.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So there's this Apple's app presumably up to date.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And you can rotate it on the six plus Leo.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   So you get the, if you don't have it.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Turn it off.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Hold on a second.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   You'll get the split view controller.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   You know why if Apple didn't rotate the home screen, the springboard, I wouldn't, I would leave it on.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   But I hate it when springboard rotates, right?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   So you get the iPad style of app on horizontal.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   That's nice.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But I, but see what I don't like is that is when this happens.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   But even if we have that resolution, is it, it still won't actually load iPad apps, correct?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Or does it make the same?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   It still runs iPhone and also it doesn't have a lot of the nice features of the iPad.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Like a lot of the four finger gestures for navigation system.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Why don't work?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   I don't believe it works with the, some of the iPad accessories through the lightning adapter.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   So it's very much still a super big iPhone as opposed to an iPad that's smaller.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Which I think is kind of a bummer because I think that it would be, I mean, I would replace my mini with it with the larger one.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   That would be more, more of a temptation for me.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Well, I'm saying that over the past week I have been using keyboards with this.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I've been doing a lot of experiments that way.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And I find that a lot of reasons why I would like just toss an iPad in the bag because I'm going out for the afternoon is now being replaced with.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Well, I've got the iPhone 6 Plus.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Maybe I'll just grab this pocket keyboard in case I want to write something.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   But otherwise I'm going to be good.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   So here is app, presumably Apple Mail is updated, right?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   So as soon as that this loads, I'll show you.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   So this is a nice spam message, but I didn't want to show you anything, any personal details in it.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   So bail arm, you're getting a free ad.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   You're getting a free ad.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   So when you turn it sideways like that, I like that.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And that actually is probably the best example of why a bigger screen is useful because of course that doesn't do anything.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That's because of all those new adaptive UI classes.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   So you have compact and regular classes and this iPhone presents itself as basically developers can target it as an iPad and horizontal view.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Right.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So I don't see a lot of, again, this is the segment which we help you decide which to buy.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   This is my problem right here.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   This is one of my chief problems.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   I really only actually wear one shirt that has different colors and this is my problem.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   This is barely fit.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   It fits beautifully.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   What are you talking about?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Now you're probably going to want a case.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   So you probably should include the case.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Once you have a case on it, it gets this one fits better.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   You need pockets of holding.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I know exactly.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   It was definitely pocket of holding.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   So, yeah.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   So, okay.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   So new apps will come out that will take advantage of the real estate and that won't look scaled.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I have to say I see the scaling but that won't look scaled and that we saw.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   This happens every time.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   There's OIS in the six plus not in the six.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And I think although a lot of people are saying the low light performance of the six is excellent, the OIS doesn't turn on unless you're in a low light.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Andy, have you done any like real side to sides or, or, or, I'm actually going to be doing that?
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I'm actually going to be doing my really intensive eight way side by side comparison tests Wednesday and then into Thursday.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I did some quick stuff with it in the backyard and like in basically in darken rooms.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   I think that you can in the right situation, you certainly can see the enhancement of the six plus.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   The I don't think you're correct.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I do think it's always image state.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   All right.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   I believe it's I believe that it's always on.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   There are the, but the reason why the iPhone six does such a good job in the light is that there are a bunch of other tricks behind the scenes.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   For instance, there is a three shot to behind the scenes trick that they're doing.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   So that let's say that you're you're taking a picture of somebody inside a church.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   It will take one show.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   It will take a sequence of three shots without you knowing it.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   The first shot will be a long exposure to capture whatever is not moving around like the actual church.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And then it will actually look combine that with those two other pictures to find sharp areas in which people weren't moving and combine that synthetically into one shot that looks where everything looks like it's nicely in focus.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   So there's a lot of elf and magic behind those that hollow tree.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   It is an amazing camera on both phones.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Yeah, we did some tests with them.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Yeah, Renee.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   We did some tests with them and it's really close.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   The six is phenomenal.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   It's phenomenal.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   But you can just see that things you zoom them up.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   You can see that the way it handles the pixels on the six plus is it's better.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   It's less noisy.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   It's one of those things where if you buy the $1000 lens as opposed to the $500 lens, some people can tell it apart.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   You know, probably you could tell it apart, but it's harder for me.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Well, I think it's the difference between Instagram and then your grandchildren 20 years later.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   And then you can see that the iPhone will take a picture that's just fine for Instagram or Facebook.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   The question is 20 years later when you realize that, oh, that was the last time that we really had everyone, all the family from Chicago and Boston and San Francisco all in the same place together.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   And you're glad that you had the iPhone six plus because this is something that will take a picture good enough to actually print out and put on the back of your sofa table.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   And then the other cameras are like, okay, that's nice. We'll put that on the Apple TV, Mark 21, and we'll wish that Grandpa actually used a proper camera.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Actually, you know, I can actually see a little bit of, well, this is not a good set test.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   And my game is doing my process.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   There's doing so much work in the background.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Also, we need the face time.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   The front facing camera is doing interesting things to the front facing camera here.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And the front facing camera is doing a lot of work in the front facing camera.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And then the front facing camera is doing a lot of work in the front facing camera.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And then the front facing camera is doing a lot of work in the front facing camera.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And then the front facing camera is doing a lot of work in the front facing camera.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And then the front facing camera is doing a lot of work in the front facing camera.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And then the front facing camera is doing a lot of work in the front facing camera.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And then the front facing camera is doing a lot of work in the front facing camera.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   So, you know, we can see it on YouTube in the backyard, kind of like a couple hours before sunset.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And it's in shade.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And so, and this is a 1.2 megapixel camera.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Let's not forget this on the iPhone 6.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And so because of the HDR, the colors are a little bit odd, but the tonality is right there.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   So there's so much, so much tricks out there.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   That's why you really do have to take it out and rock and roll with it for a few days before you appreciate that has specs that go beyond what the actual hardware is.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   So, okay.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   So we're just talking about differences.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Obviously screen resolution, camera, and then battery life.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   How about that?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   It's a monster.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   I go to sleep and it's still a 38%, which is nuts for the 6 plus.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Yeah, I have yet to put when I'm finally wrapping up my last Android phone stuff today, which means I can finally put my sim in this AT&T iPhone.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   So it's only been used on Wi-Fi for the since Friday, but I was charged up fully on Friday and had to charge it again today.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And that's a guy who's been spending all weekend playing with it and watching movies with it and listening to music with it.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   It's just a monster, this iPhone 6 plus battery.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   6 plus.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   How about the 6?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   What's the battery life for the 6?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   The 6 is good.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   I think I would put it at a little bit better than what you get on the iPhone 5S, but not so dramatically better that it would influence your buying decision.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I mean, if you're, there are a lot of people who actually have tethering on their iPads because they can just use that as your two day broadband base station.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I think that this is going to attract a lot of people for the same reason.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   If you're using this also as your internet access point as you travel or even spending the day outside the office, you will be able to, after using this as your base station for your Macbook or any other notebook all day long, you'll be able to board the community train home and still have enough juice left to have it.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   To have a good time on that train right home.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I've had the exact same thing.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   The battery life, some people have been confused because when you first install it, if you restore from a backup, it's got to download everything again.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   It's got to re-index spotlight.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   There's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   So the first couple of days, it's hard to get good battery readings, but it's lasting a little bit longer than my iPhone 5S, nowhere nearly as long as a 6 plus.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   And to Andy's point on Rogers now, Rogers LTE is obscene.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   It's not even LTE advanced yet, but they've got, I think, 15 to 20 lanes of LTE.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And I'm getting 90 down in my condo and 90 down at Starbucks, which is twice as fast as my broadband.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I turn off Wi-Fi.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   I'm curious what AT&T is giving us here in the studio.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   I don't think AT&T has the enhanced, I think, Verizon's the only one in the US.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   It's only Verizon.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Well, this is Verizon.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Let me turn off.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I got 90 down on Josh's T-Mobile.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Sorry?
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   That's because no one uses T-Mobile.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And it's probably true.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I just got, that's what I was interested.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I want the Wi-Fi calling.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   A couple of other points.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   The Apple store was telling us, and I asked several people, the T-Mobile is locked.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   The T-Mobile is not carrier locked.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   We have learned.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I bought mine completely un-lorn.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And another point, which I think is great, is the Verizon version is SIM card unlocked as it has been in the past,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   which is very good news because, for instance, I could take this to England, have Verizon here, get all those bands of LTE,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   but still take it to England and use T-Mobile and have the free international.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   And also now the new Verizon will allow you to do both data and voice.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I've voiced a royalty here, I think so, yeah.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   So now you can--
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   So let me turn off Wi-Fi as you as a speed test because I'm curious what we're going to get here.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Now, I don't know what Verizon is like normally here.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   All right.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   So I think is that all of the pros and cons that we would need to make help Alex make the right choice?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Size, obviously.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Battery life.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Camera.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Number one thing for me is just knowing how much of a difference the optical image stabilization is.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   The only other thing I point out is it depends on your use case.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   For example, I quite often use my iPhone 5S when I was walking around with coffee or if I'm on the streets.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   I can't do that with the iPhone 6.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   It's just big enough that it's not that I can't reach it, when I try it, I feel like I'm going to drop my phone
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   and I just stop and I say, "No, I'm going to put it down."
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   It's a hand and a half.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   The iPhone 6, I can use perfectly well one-handed without any problems because it's so thin, it's so round that it still feels great.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   The iPhone 6 plus, I can't do that anymore.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   I think that it's the first iPhone where I think that having it in a really good case is going to change how you use it.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I can't wait for really good folio cases, fold-over cases come out for this because you're absolutely right.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I've been carrying this without the case only because I want to be able to feel like how warm does it get in the back when I'm using it.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   All this sort of stuff when you're just testing a phone.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   But I also have the silicone sleeve for it.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   When it's in that sleeve, I have a little bit more of a firm control over it.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   This is one of the slipperiest phones I think Apple has made.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   I was just putting it down on the end table just about a couple hours ago while I was getting other stuff ready.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   I could just see it slightly going.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   It's like the Nexus 4. Remember that it would fall off a flat table?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   So I think that you're right.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Once we have cases that allow you to get a little bit better grip on it, I can certainly walk and use it so long as I don't have to access most of the screen.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   My basic takeaway on it is on the 6 and the 6 plus is that your default should be the 6.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   I think that any iPhone user will be extremely happy with the 6 and will not have a complaint about it.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   If you have a reason for the 6 plus to have this larger screen, whether you want to, your system administrator and you want to do remote access and have more screen, you watch a lot of movies, you read a lot of books, you really want to want the extra battery life for for acting as a base station
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   or assuming that the camera tests pay off as well as I hope they will, you really, you really do are frustrated by low light photography in other iPhones.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Then get it, but don't you have to have a reason in mind. Don't think that while I've got, I don't know which one to get. I mean, as we'll get the bigger one because I think you're going to be kind of unhappy with it, especially after spending five years using phones that are, you know, as small as this.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   This is like, I had to get, I had to get out like the pre stretched out version and holy cats. Is that a difference?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   The 9-phone is about as long as this screen is wide. It's amazing. All of the people I know who have come from 5S or even less are struggling a little bit with the 6 plus because it is such a big jump.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   I surprised myself. I've been using a phone of the 6 plus's side for the last six months. And I really like the 6. I think the size of this, I've always felt 4.7 is kind of exactly the right size for a phone.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   What is that screen shot? Oh, that's showing us. This is the amount of pixels in the original iPhone, which is way down here. That was 2007 and the current.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   You might as well show a blackberry pager next to that. I mean, it really does feel like the iPhone 6 is a linear successor to the iPhones and the 6 plus is something new. It's like the giant size.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Very much do.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   When you use this for just a few minutes and you look back at an iPhone 5S and it looks so thick and small and square and then you look back at one of the phones and he held up and it looks like a little toy. It's amazing how quickly your brain recalibrates.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Having used all the iPhones and not full time for the last couple of years, I admit, this the 6 itself is easily the nicest iPhone they've ever made. I really feel like this is a stunning work of Apple.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Apple says that every year they say that we believe that this is the best iPhone we've ever made. And of course means in terms of specs in terms of features, that's always true.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   But this really is the first time it feels like they could almost have called this the iPhone 2 like Mark 2 because it's almost as if every iPhone before this was just laying groundwork for this because this is so superior in every way.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   There's hands down the biggest upgrade I think they've ever done in hardware.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Did you see John Travolta?
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Oh, that was painful.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   So it's called too many martinis before the show.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   He, I don't even know whose name he was trying to say.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Edina Menzel.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   He didn't say Edina Menzel, did he?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Someone, one of my favorite bloggers said, you know, John Travolta's job on stage was he only had to do two things. Die his hair a natural color and say Edina Menzel, he failed to do either of those things.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Let me play. Let me play the clip of. I think he's on this is on here. Oscar is Oscar moments.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Please welcome the wickedly talented one and only.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I don't think he knows.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Listen.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   The wickedly talented one and only.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   I don't think he knows.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   I don't think he.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   It's like someone in American Idol and I can't remember the words.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Well, I mean, so the funny thing about this, you know, we work on a lot of live shows with a lot of people.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   We work on a lot of live shows with celebrities and what you end up with.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   You saw this with Harrison Ford as well.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   You can set like if you work on enough of these shows, you can tell who was worried about their presentation and who didn't care.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   So like Harrison Ford obviously did not.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   He's probably not on there. It's not like he made a mistake, but he obviously the first time he saw whatever he was saying was the first one on there.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Yeah, it's called cold reading versus right.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   But you can tell that some people who thought about it, they worked on it. You can tell they probably practiced it over and over and over again.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And then there are some people who decided that they were just going to, you know, this is something they have to do.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And so they just they got up and did it because they want, you know, so he was he was supposed to say.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   What was the name he was supposed to say again?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   He didn't even tell.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And he said and still.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   So now there's a if you go to slate, there's a little calculator that tells the same name generator.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   You could revoltify your name.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Let's see. Leo LePort.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   That's where you're going to crack up.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Luke.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   He's.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   That was the Alex.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   You can only do it once.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   They force you to reload so that they get all the pages.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Alex Lindsay.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And now the wonderfully talented.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Let's welcome the stage.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   The wonderfully talented.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I got a little Swiss.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Just call me our guy.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Les was.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   And that's and that's the day that he finally believed his wife that yeah, maybe I should get my contact when it's written updated.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And then I actually very sympathetic because once you've done that, you can't like say what let me fix it.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   No, they've moved on.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   And you're.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   You live in infamy forever forever and infamy.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   This is actually very exciting.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   We have launched the Twitter Internet.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   What is it?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   International.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Friendships satellite.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   And now it can be seen in places without the Internet all around the world of places where the Internet is blocked.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And I think our video engineer Alex Gumpel is prepared to.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Are you going to flip the switch?
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Well, we actually have a live shot of the satellite.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Let's see it.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Wow.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   That's exciting.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   It looks like Sandra Bullock is out there fixing it.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   I was not counting my friends.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   [laughter]
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Pro.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   What do you do?
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   What do I do?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Now in space.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   So whenever you're ready we can go ahead and do an additional friendship.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Satellite.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   You're producer is getting your.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   [laughter]
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And now let's flip the switch.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Are we ready to use the satellite?
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Let us begin our broadcast day coming to you live from the Twitch friendship.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   International friendship satellite.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Okay, you can launch it.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Let the switch.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Here we go.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   [laughter]
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   There you look at that picture.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Okay.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   That's coming to you from space my friends.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Alright, let's listen.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   So now all of our broadcast day will be coming to you from the satellite.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Look at that quality, huh?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   I love it.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Even you can't do that.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Take that, Internetz.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Welcome to MacFrake Weekly.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Coming to you live from space.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   This is really a red light.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   It's going to space.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   It's going to space.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   We want to say hello to all our friends in North Korea.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   In Turkey.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Look at this.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   In Russia.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   It is, it is, it is really the launch of the international friendship satellite.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   It's such a really significant, I think, advance for us here at the.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   I really see I think the lower thirds have really improved as long as I am.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   You like those?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   We had a little issue with the Tri-Castor lower thirds.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   We can't really use, so we have to have our own character.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Joe Kyron there.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Circa 1982.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I like that.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   There's Andy.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   It's got the wrong URL for his.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   We can't fix it now because the guy who actually set those lower thirds up is dead.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   It's okay, it's a pun though.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   [laughter]
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   But you, that's him up there.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   [laughter]
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   He's space.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Fixing the satellite.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Wow.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Renee Ritchie from Montreal.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Good to have you from iMore.com.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Renee, are you opening a store?
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   It looks like you're opening a store.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Renee's got some serious Lego action.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Did you put the Arkham Asylum away in this?
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Right over here.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   I don't know if you can see it.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   I need to get better lighting for it, but it's right behind me.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   It's an episode of Ham Nation.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   [laughter]
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Hey, we got a special Ham Nation tonight, by the way.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Joe Walsh is going to be on the show.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   I'm Troy Knight with the Eat from the Eagles, and he's a ham.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   I didn't know this.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   And he did the Ham Nation theme song.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   So I'm hoping we'll put that episode of Ham Nation on the International Friendship Satellite as well.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   I think that's fairly important.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Why did you go?
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   I'm a little concerned because video engineer Alex Gumple went running across the studio.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Is there something I should...
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   I'm just checking the thing.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   He's just checking things.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   The flux capacitor seems to be on the fritz right now.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Do we have a shot of the signal processor?
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   We're sending this stuff through.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   You would like this.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Did you see this?
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   I haven't seen this before until today.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   I didn't realize we had this all.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   We're entering the 20th century now.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   [laughter]
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   This is not a joke.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And actually, if you look at the wiring, it spells something...
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   That is awesome.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Geek TV?
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   So with that...
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   The signal is going through that coiled wire.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   They've run a 60 Hertz process, a power cord across it.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   What else can you do?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   The fan's good.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   It generates a little bit of...
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   [laughter]
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   This is awesome.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   [laughter]
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   There's a serious case of why didn't I think of that?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   I said they're in spend a lot of time doing effects and after effects
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   and other things and I could have just made a coil of wires and
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   shake them.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   So good.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   So good.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Thank you, Alex, for...
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I charged him.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   I said, "What would this show look like in 1968?"
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   For transcript of the Phil Donahue show, send a selfless dress on
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   look to Mac Break Weekly, 396 episode Boulevard.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   [laughter]
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Even Alex looks the part.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Thank you, Alex Gumpel.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   You rock.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   That's great.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   And Happy April Fool's Day, everybody.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   I'm not good at April Fool's jokes because I get bit.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   I believe these things.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   It's very hard to go around the internet this time of year and try
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   to figure out, is this true?
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Is this not true?
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   It's particularly a problem in the Mac news industry since so much
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   stuff is rumor and bizarre anyway.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Is my mother's favorite holiday?
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Shh.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Is she the kind of person who puts salt in the sugar bowl so
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   that when you get up for breakfast and you have your cookies?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   That was one of her many, many mornings.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   She's short-shaped the beds.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Her favorite one was changing all of our clocks to two hours
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   earlier for school.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Oh, that's so mean.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   And then rushing us around and then us finding out that we're two
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   hours early.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   I mean, she would do...
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   She would...
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   My dad actually wrecked his car on April one many years ago and
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   he called and she wouldn't believe him.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   He's like, "I need you to send someone I'm hanging upside down."
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   And she just laughed at him.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   No, we can go clean now.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Okay.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   I don't want to hear it.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   A cigarette company is sponsoring a study video.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   [laughter]
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Ah, Tarraton!
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Well, then we got...
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   What was the one where people had black eyes from...
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   I'd rather fight than switch.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   I'd rather fight than switch.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Was that Tarraton?
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   All right.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   Let's...
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   [music]
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   [music]
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Okay, here we go.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   No, no, no, no, it's so...
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   No, no, no, no, it's...
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   You know, if you're wondering how he eats some greens and other
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   sides of Max, just repeat to yourself, it's just a show that
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   I should really just relax.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Or a backbreak weekly, four nights, six.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Is that live?
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Yes!
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   It's live.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   We didn't record this.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   That's a real can with a real beat on the front of it.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   That's a beat?
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   I don't know.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   I don't know.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Brought to you by Emerson TV, the clearest, sharpest, 12 inch
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   picture in America.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   [music]
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   RCA.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   [music]
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Hey, Burke.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Burke, are you there, Burke?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   [music]
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Thank you, thanks.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   With which to kill people that are dust.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   They have to zoom in and then see him, like, hanging.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   At Aloma, we have a problem.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   I wonder if they'll figure out what my little joke is for today.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Oh, that's what I hate about April Fool's.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Oh, I can't keep it in.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   It's supposed to be Sir Galahad, but it's actually Sir Gawain.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Gawain wasn't taking the empty table at the round table.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   You can go to the show.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   I'm so excited.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   You're such a jokester.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   I just sit on that one, Leo.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   I knew I'd blow it.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Because everyone's probably like, "Oh my God, that looks like the
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   round table."
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   But that doesn't look like...
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   That's exciting.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   We're going to sit...
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   This is really exciting.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   This is the year 2015, next week, starting next week, that we're
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   going to get to see the new Apple Watch and maybe a new Apple
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   TV and a lot more.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Remember when Andy and Aco got his first glimpse of the Apple
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Watch?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   He was there at the event.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Tucked a little bit about it on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   We are down there in Cupertino using something called a live
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   view.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   We've used it before.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   It's yours and I thank you for lending it to us.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   That gives us a connection live in real time via LTE.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   But there is some internet latency.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   So we think there's one or two seconds.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   It's set to three.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Okay.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   You can turn it down.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   You can turn it down?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   We're getting a great image.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   I can't believe it.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   We'll see what it looks like when we turn it down.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Turn it down.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   We don't need to see Andy and High Death.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   I mean, look at...
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   I'm used to seeing him and High Death.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   We're used to seeing him in...
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   I don't know what's going on with the camera.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   There we go.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Andy and Aco.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   And I don't know if he's going to be able to hear me, but let's
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   see if he can.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Andy is in Cupertino.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Andy, welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   We're joined by I Justine, Mike Elgin, Alex Lindsey.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   And I already have seen the tweet you put out of you bulging
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   your eyes bulging with the Apple Watch.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   [Laughs]
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   No, I'm just...
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   It's pretty darkened there.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   So if you want to get those diopters functioning in your own
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Metapro and polypsis, you've got to basically give them some help.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   We have a little bit of latencies.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Sorry about that.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   I've been examining tiny, tiny pixels for the past hour.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   [Laughs]
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   What?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Well, and that's my question.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Now, I know it was in a demo mode.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   It didn't look like you could actually manipulate it, but you were
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   at least able to watch it.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   So, what's it like?
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   Does it feel big?
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Does it feel thick?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   How does it compare?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   You've got the Moto 360.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   What does the screen look like?
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   It's obviously a high-res screen.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   The resolution on the screen is fantastic.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   You really have to strain your eyes to see any pixels whatsoever.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Obviously, every time Apple does an event like this, they create a room
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   in which their screens look great.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   But even under those conditions, you have to say that that screen looked great.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Big, punchy colors.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   There is a mode where it's showing you a special button, when you punch it,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   you see pictures of your favorite contacts and every picture in there
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   looked like a beautiful, tiny little cameo portrait, as opposed to just like an
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   avatar or a little icon.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   It's really quite a treat to use it.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   The weight is surprising.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   They do have three different models.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   If you have the sport model that's made out of a special kind of aluminum,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   that feels pretty okay.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   It feels about the same weight as the Moto 360 on my wrist, which is so
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   light that oftentimes I forget that I have it on.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   I go back to the bedroom to get it off the charger.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Oh, wait, no, you actually have it on.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   If you have the stainless steel model, that's a big,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   chunk of watch.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Not so much that it's going to intimidate you.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   If you're familiar with high quality watches, you have definitely felt watches
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   of the solid before, but maybe you're not quite expecting to be that big.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Everything's rounded over.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   There's no blemishes.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   The fit and finish is perfect.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   They have a leather magnetic watch band.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   There's the one that I wore.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Instead of having a buckle like this, it just simply flaps over itself and holds
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   fast, which means it's infinitely adjustable.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Maybe I should have asked first, but after they put this on my wrist,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   I went like this to see if it would fall off and it was holding just perfectly fine.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Yeah, I would have done the same thing because I'm not sure I'd trust in magnet.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Those bands do look really nice.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   What do you think, Annie?
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   They're going to charge $49.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   It depends on which one you get.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   The cheapest one is that I have to go back to my nose to find exactly what it is.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   It's typical pricing I thought for an Apple product, which is it's certainly
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   more expensive than whatever the rest of the industry has decided is the going
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   rate for the sort of product, but not so much expensive that you wouldn't say,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   "Well, I'll wait a few more months," or "I'll make the kids combined birthday
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   and Christmas present."
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   What Maraisie's been seeing is how well all this stuff works together because as you say,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   the one thing you absolutely were not allowed to do was to touch it.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Jason Snell is the hero of our little group because he actually was able to put a finger
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   on it, and I think that whoever was letting do that was hustled out under a bag.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   I tried to even take -- I met some friends of mine who work for Apple,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   one of which who had one on, and it was like, "I can't show you this and I can't let you do this."
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And that's fine, you have to ask anyway.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   So that's no different than what the original iPhone was like.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   I got a briefing for that one in which I got to actually use one of these things
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   that was three months away from being shipped, and there were a couple of things that --
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   it worked except for one or two apps that weren't ready yet, so maybe that's the situation
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   because obviously if you let just 100 different journalists peak pro-poken prod,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   they're going to find the one app that's just a JPEG, and then they say,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   "Oh, well, you know, the notes that have been functional, it's just a painting,"
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   and they might, using that tone of voice in their writing,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   do something that's completely unhelpful and uncalled for.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   So I'm not -- it'd be interesting to have a more -- a greater picture based on that,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   but you get what you get.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   The most interesting thing that I found is that not a peep as to what the battery life is.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   It was -- I was so scraping for details that I had to take quick notes as Tim Cook was talking
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   about this wonderful, inductive magnetic charging system,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   and I heard him say, "It's so easy to -- you're going to find this so easy to connect to the charger every night."
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   Anyway, look at this styling in the bands, and so I don't know if that means that they are expecting
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   one day of life per charge, but we'll see how that goes.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Again, so many unanswered questions, but I think that what we were looking for is,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   does this thing look like it's something that's cool?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Does it immediately sort of activate the lizard part of your brain that says,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   "Aquire, acquire, acquire," and it certainly did that.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Certainly to a better extent than any of the Android Wear watches from LG or Samsung,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   and the Moto 360, I think this is a really, really nice watch.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   I've been wearing it for the past four or five days.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   I've been testing it for review later this week, and I've been finding it very, very useful,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   and even that doesn't look quite so nice compared to the Apple watch,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   and I was surprised that I would like a square wristwatch like this,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   but again, like so many things they solve the problem.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   See, I never got in the comic books as a kid.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Like all you guys really are just reliving your childhood.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   I was programming --
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   If you like 300, you see the response called three.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Oh, look, there's what I just ordered.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Wait a minute, you have it in hardcover.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Of course.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   That's what she said.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Oh, oh.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Well, wait a minute, I got the wrong one.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   They don't have a hardcover on Amazon.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   They do have absolute sandman, Leo.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Look for that.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Oh, I'm going to quickly cancel this.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   I would show you mine, but Guy English has them right now.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   So I don't want paper back.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   This is the best one.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   This is the --
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   Cancelling.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   This is the volume that has the emperor Norton story.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Cancel, ordered by mistake.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   What do you say when you cancel an Amazon thing?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   They say select cancellation reason.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   And mostly it's just because I don't want it anymore.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   That darn kid of mine.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   They should have that.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   They should have a drop down.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   This is too easy to order in the first place.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   That's right.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   Your stupid one click gets me in trouble every time.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   So it's called -- what is it?
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Sandman?
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Sandman?
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   This one, this is absolute sandman.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   Absolute sandman.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   I don't know if I have that.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   I think --
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Is that the complete sand?
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   They've done these things where they recolored the entire thing.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   And there's bonus.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   There's volumes.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   There's four volumes.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Well, now I'm talking $500.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   Oh, so worth it, Leo.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   I just wanted one thing.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   You're already thinking about it too much.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   This is why one click is so good.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   And this is why Comixology is throwing them stuff.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   You're eating bucks each.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   If you give yourself five seconds to think about whether I want to --
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   whether I want to start getting into the original Sin Maxi series on Marvel,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   you're not going to buy it.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   It's a five-second thought process.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   There are five volumes at almost $80 each.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   We're talking $400.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   But it's kind of ribbon.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   You see a ribbon that's like a ribbon bookmark.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   It's classy as hell.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Should I order volume one and see if I like it?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Here's the barcode.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Just like grab the barcode off of this.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   In case that's all you need to do.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Anyone who's downloading this, just get this barcode.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   You can't go half wrong with it.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   I watched that silly newspaper Comix movie you mentioned,
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   and I went out and got the complete Calvin and Hobbes because of you.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Now this.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   And now your life is so much better.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   There's a happy face on your absolute watch.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   What can you guys are such nerds?
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   See, not just we had comments,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   but we could bring out our slip-case editions on 30 seconds notice.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   They're sitting next to you at all times.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   So good.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Of course, you don't have the tip-in book plate that had the Dave McKeon thing to share.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   What's that, Merlin?
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   What's that?
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Is that hard drives?
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   You're muted.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   You're muted, but I'm sure he's saying something fast.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   We can't hear you.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Audio gone.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   I was just going to say if you're really a fan of Sam and do what I did and get the raw files.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   It's $165,000.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Aaron, Aaron Berger, change your Dropbox password.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   Daniel gave his hard drives.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   But not for another few days because I'm still downloading the finale.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   Oh my God, I love you guys.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   Let's just forget this and just do this show from now on.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   This is fun.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   Comics break weekly.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Comics break weekly.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   Hey, something happened.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   While I was gone and I was kind of a gas shocked, blown away, and I'm talking about the video.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   I first saw Marcus Brownlee's video of the sapphire, ported sapphire screen of the iPhone 6, the
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   4.7 inch screen.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Then he mentioned Sonny Dixon.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   He got it from Sonny Dixon.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.560]   I saw that Sonny and others had posted videos from China.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.000]   I think this surprised me.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.280]   Typically you'll get these anonymous posts from Chinese sources.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:51.560]   For somebody who have Marcus's stature to come forward and say, "I have what I believe
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.120]   to be the iPhone 6 bezel in sapphire."
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:57.040]   He cut it with a knife and he bent it and all this stuff.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:01.280]   But the thing that I found, in fact I immediately wanted it, I almost called you Renee and said,
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.280]   "Is this possible?
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.920]   What do you think?
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   Is this real?"
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.400]   It'd be awfully hard to fake whatever that is.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.280]   Now, by the way, no one knows if it is sapphire.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.800]   I don't know if there's a way to tell, I guess, a mass spectrometer.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:16.960]   Gorilla Glass 3, which others are using, is similar, is it not?
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.640]   It's hard to know what the practical difference is going to be.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.720]   I don't think the Gorilla Glass can stand up to the sort of abuse that he seems to be
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:23.920]   giving it right now.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:35.800]   So I have in my hands, this is a Samsung Galaxy S3 front cover.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.120]   Let's just take this off.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.320]   I want to get 5 million views.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:46.960]   And I have a hard, sharp knife.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:47.960]   Not a scratch.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.400]   It's pretty hard to use a sharp knife.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.480]   Also, the panel by itself is thin and will bend when it's on.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   Oh, it's flexible.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.480]   Oh, it's flexible.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.480]   Oh, please.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.680]   I think I'm bleeding.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.680]   Ah, damn.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.680]   Oh.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   Well, there you go.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:08.320]   Somebody please sweep those glass shards off of the table.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.320]   Is that glass?
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.440]   Yeah, well, there's pointy.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.440]   Is that blood?
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.440]   Wow.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.160]   That really, OK, don't do this at home.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.040]   I can't drink my water coffee now.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.040]   Exactly.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.000]   And I hope the people in the front row in the studio, I answer OK.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.880]   And meanwhile, let's get another shot at blood because I do want those 5 million views.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.520]   Yeah, that's real blood.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.160]   That's really a look for his audience.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.400]   Now, let's be really careful here.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.120]   And look at that stuff you peeled off of that top.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.080]   Did any of them say, don't try to break it with your bare hands?
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.200]   Because if it doesn't, we got a lawsuit.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.720]   That sounds like money, Leo.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.720]   Sam's on money.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.720]   I didn't really expect that.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.120]   Can you give me a break?
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120]   I think it hurts.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   I've been punctured.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.120]   Well, I'll take a look at it.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:57.560]   That's not something that I would have instinctively thought to do myself.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.840]   Hey, but I, you know what?
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.920]   I take a hit for the hits.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.760]   We suffer for our art.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   Our art.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.760]   Wow.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.800]   As the power of millions of smart phone trains.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.960]   Keyboard strokes in those hands.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.600]   So OK, so we could say this much.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.800]   It's better than the Galaxy S3 front cover.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, I've proven it.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:23.280]   I get if you, if you would, but you still can't drive your rental truck over it.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.800]   And really, why screw with us, Apple?
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.840]   If you're saying you can't drive a rental truck over it.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.720]   I don't know if that's glass or just shards of plastic.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.080]   If people are watching, we need a super cut now of Leo and Marquez both.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:38.240]   Let's talk about big boy pants.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   Put them on.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.840]   We're one of ours.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.200]   I sense a title.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.560]   Put on the big boy pants.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:50.520]   The squirrer memorandum, which is not like the born identity.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.520]   It's something different.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:55.960]   It feels like this should be a novel by Grisham.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.760]   The squirrer memorandum was revealed on Friday.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:05.120]   The judge did against Apple's wishes, unseal it and gives us a little bit of an insight,
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:09.400]   a little bit of a picture into the agreements Apple makes with its suppliers.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:16.480]   You remember the story is GT Advanced, which is a, they were a Sapphire furnace maker.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.360]   They sold Sapphire furnaces.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:26.920]   Apple lent them almost half a billion dollars to build a plant in Mesa, Arizona with GT furnaces.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:30.760]   But with GT running it to make Sapphire as yet.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:31.760]   These guys hadn't been the vice.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.760]   They hadn't been making Sapphire.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:33.760]   They had never done it.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.360]   They made the machines that made Sapphire.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.040]   Of course, remember most of Apple suppliers are probably not in the US, I would guess.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.680]   They're in mostly in Asia.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.160]   But I guess the same template is applied to them.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:52.520]   A squirrer in the memorandum says, "Apple never really entered into negotiations.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:57.480]   Appling instead, the managers should not waste their time negotiating because Apple doesn't
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.240]   negotiate with suppliers."
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:04.040]   We don't negotiate with terrorists and we don't negotiate with suppliers.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.400]   According to a GT, after the company said, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   We got it."
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:14.120]   Apple said, "Look, these are our terms for other Apple suppliers and you should quote,
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   put on your big boy pants and accept the agreement."
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:21.280]   And by the way, we've worked with, we work with a lot of Fortune 100 companies and that's
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:25.200]   a pretty standard thing for, I mean, we weren't even talking about Apple being that way, but
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.720]   most agreements that we get, we have the choice of either doing work with them and signing
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.480]   that contract or we're not going to do any work with them.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:32.480]   That's a pretty common thing.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:37.560]   Are they wearing Darth Vader suits when they negotiate?
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:40.040]   No, no.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.240]   They just really mean emails about why.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:51.560]   So, at the closing meeting, we're going to have to ask that each person bring in one tire
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.480]   from their car and give it to us.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.560]   I know we don't need it as a part of the deal.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.480]   We just want to make you know that we can make you do whatever you want.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.480]   Right.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.480]   Right.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.480]   Exactly.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.000]   And yeah, I mean, I think that most people would be so happy to get an Apple deal that
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   they'd go, yeah.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.720]   There's a lot of companies, there's a lot of carcasses along the road that have made
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.400]   big deals with like these companies and this is one of them.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.400]   GT is one of them.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:19.280]   We've almost been killed by big contracts, you know, and it's it is a.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.080]   I guess you can't expect Apple.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.480]   I mean, should Apple be a kinder gentler Apple?
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.080]   No, no, but it's okay.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.240]   You couldn't make this Sapphire.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.840]   But if you're a little company, but no, no, no, not at all.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.280]   You're doing you're doing a deal with the devil.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:35.320]   You're saying, all right, I'm putting the, I mean, that's where squiller.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.560]   You actually need to put on his big boy pants and say, look, squiller, you're the COO.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.880]   He's the chief operating officer.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.800]   You made this deal.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.320]   If you didn't think you could do it, you shouldn't have made it.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.320]   It's like going to Vegas.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.560]   I'm going to, I'm all in.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.360]   And the thing is, is that you, yeah, you definitely have to accept when you, when you
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.200]   sign these contracts, and the reason we're so particular about our contracts is that
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:58.160]   if you, when we sign that contract, we assume that they mean everything and like, they'll
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.240]   tell you, oh, well, that we're not going to ever do that.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.600]   Well, they might there, you know, you don't, you're talking to one person.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.360]   You don't know how it's going to turn out some, some major.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:13.440]   And so, and if you think that there's a problem, you need to, you know, as a CEO, it's your
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:19.120]   job to, to make the decision that we're, and we walk away from business because the contracts
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.120]   don't work.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.400]   I can't, I can't do that.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.400]   I can't do that.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.400]   GT should have.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.360]   So we're just seeing the car wreck that sometimes happens when a company, like, but it's hard.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.920]   I mean, they're offering you half a billion dollars and as a little company, I'm, I'm,
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.640]   it's very clear why they did that.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:36.600]   Let me tell you what went wrong because we know from the memorandum and we know the first
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:41.480]   thing we already knew was a $50 million penalty if you breach confidentiality per occurrence.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.200]   We knew that that's, that has been out already.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.560]   This is a, maybe you should have looked twice at this, Mr. Squiller.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:54.160]   No manufacturing process can be modified by GT without Apple's prior consent, but GT
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.720]   must immediately implement any of Apple's suggestions.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.760]   That's kind of giving up your company.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.720]   You're like wondering why Apple doesn't just buy you and build the stuff themselves at
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   a point.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.720]   I mean, that's worse.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:08.800]   GT must fulfill any purchase order placed by Apple on the date Apple picks or you have
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.240]   to buy substitute goods at your own expense.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   Yes.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.240]   So if you don't have this app for the day we want it, you better give us some.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.280]   In addition, the plant was built without input from GT.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.280]   That I don't understand.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.840]   I mean, like this, here's the thing is, is that I get that Apple pushes a hard bargain,
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.320]   but this was not a smart move.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.240]   This is a really hard bargain.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.880]   The plant was built, for instance, without backup power generators because Apple deemed
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.960]   them too expensive.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.120]   But now remember if GT can't deliver on date and time, then, you know, so if the power goes
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.160]   out there, screwed, Apple also embedded its own employees at the Mesa plant who, quote,
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.280]   assumed a level of authority and, quote, it had to be reminded not to order GT employees
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280]   around.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.280]   So you're right.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.280]   They should just bought the thing.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.320]   I mean, if you're going to have that much control, you know, nobody has enough control
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.280]   to make it actually work.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.040]   Here said Apple initially wanted to purchase the Sapphire furnaces from GT, but ended up
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.400]   offering this different deal, a new structure where GT borrowed money from Apple.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.680]   Remember, this isn't a gift borrowed money from Apple to purchase the furnace components
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.960]   in order to supply Apple with the Sapphire crystal.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.320]   Apple also prohibited GT from doing business with other manufacturers or suppliers working
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.400]   in consumer electronics.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:27.680]   They have an exclusive squiller called Apple's tactics, a classic bait and switch strategy
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.240]   and described the final agreement as onerous and massively one sided.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.280]   On the other hand, you signed the deal squiller.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.920]   Yeah, that's exactly it.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.800]   Making things worse for GT, if Apple decided not to use Sapphire crystal in its upcoming
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:48.680]   products, which they in fact did, GT would be required to repay the loan fully in cash.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.520]   And so this is all unsealed as part of a settlement in which Apple agreed that GT could sell the
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:57.560]   furnaces and whatever they got would be sufficient to settle that with Apple.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.040]   In other words, Apple said, "All right, we're not going to get all our money back."
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.280]   So in fact, I think Apple, you could make the argument that Apple did the right thing.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.880]   I mean, both of them were throwing a long bomb.
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.880]   Both of them wanted a cutting edge technology.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.520]   You know, GT wanted the big contract.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.160]   Apple wanted to have this new thing that nobody else has.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:20.600]   And they both took a big risk and they should put their big boy pants on.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.080]   That Apple, but GT, look.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.240]   They made a long bet and you lost.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.240]   And there's no time.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.320]   This is not the time to start saying, "Well, it was an unfair deal.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.320]   I didn't like that."
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.320]   Play the Kenny Logins music, Leo.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.560]   Play the Kenny Logins music.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.560]   Which one?
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.560]   Play the Kenny Rogers.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.560]   Kenny Rogers.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.560]   Oh, you got to know when to hold them.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.440]   But you can see how when to fold them.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.000]   Now, saying all of that, you can see that the tactical thing to do is exactly what GT
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.440]   did, which is declare bankruptcy.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.600]   I mean, there was no way they're going to be able to do anything else.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.280]   And so, while it sounds like they're complaining now, I think more of it is they're just making
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.040]   the legal argument that says we can't pay that.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:58.720]   I think Apple could reasonably complain saying, "Look, we're getting pennies back on our
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.720]   impasse."
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:00.720]   But I'm saying, we can all complain.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.520]   But what we're watching here is legal.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.520]   This is how it happened.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.520]   This is legal.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.480]   You're saying that as the son of a litigator.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.160]   I'm just saying that when you're not going to be able to make all the bills, you're going
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.160]   to have to claim bankruptcy.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.160]   What happens?
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.760]   And in that, you're going to say, "These are the things that happened and these are
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:16.240]   the things whether you were right or wrong, the bottom line is you're in a position where
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.680]   and the only way for them to leverage themselves out of it was," you know.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.160]   And it's a chapter 11 bankruptcy, which is essentially reorganization saying to creditors.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.160]   We can't keep all the money.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   The prime of the money being an Apple.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   It was essentially--
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160]   It was a stock sale that was interesting before the--
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.160]   Okay.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.160]   So the CEO of GT--
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.160]   The day before Apple's iPhone announcement.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.160]   No.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.160]   Oh, I thought it was--
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160]   The day before the Apple announcement.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.640]   Oh, a month before the bankruptcy announcement.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.920]   Sold like $100 million of stock.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920]   So--
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.920]   Was it that much?
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.920]   I can't remember that much.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.920]   You want to show that.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920]   You want to show that?
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920]   You want to show that money.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.080]   I think it was $160,000 of stock.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.720]   He sold-- you're right.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.480]   $160,000 in stock.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.560]   He said it was part of an ongoing stock dump.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.920]   I've been dumping the stock for years.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.440]   But the fact that it was the day before the announcement and the announcement at this
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.960]   point he knew was not going to include sapphire screens.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.240]   Hopefully he was doing that regularly because otherwise that's a--
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.120]   Well, I'm sure if there's any irregularities here that the SEC will--
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.120]   Yeah, he'll end up in jail.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.120]   We'll investigate.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120]   Or the big find.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.400]   He says it was part of a pre-arranged plan that was established in March.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.400]   Probably--
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   A lot of CEOs do that.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.600]   I mean, and most CEOs of that size, a lot of CEOs will set up a payment like every month
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.360]   or every week or even every day.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.600]   You know, that's where they--
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.920]   You should go on and sell the day after the Apple--
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.160]   Yeah, I would say the most cases you would sell after your big announcement involving
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.680]   your product unless you knew.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.000]   Well, and again, a lot of CEOs will do it regularly all the time, specifically not to
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.440]   show any irregularities.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.800]   Is that the travel size Emmy?
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.720]   Because it doesn't look like it's in a skin.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.720]   Oh, wow.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.720]   He just swung that out.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.160]   You didn't even see it coming.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160]   It was like Braveheart.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:04.320]   No, no, I've never won an Emmy.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.320]   So I don't know what it is.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.320]   What is the travel size Emmy?
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.520]   So it's like the one that gives Kristen China weather something so that she doesn't look
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.520]   quite so small.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.720]   That was like the sectional staff in Braveheart.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.720]   He just swung it out.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.480]   Leah was just walking by.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.480]   Ah!
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.960]   You know, you can actually do with this thing.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960]   This thing is sharp.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.600]   Right to the heart.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.200]   All right, I'm just going to put my Emmy Emmy on.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.640]   You just gave it away.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.280]   Like hold the base of the camera again.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.240]   Hold the base of the camera again.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.840]   You can see the barcode where you bought it from Spencer.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.840]   Owls.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.840]   Owls.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.280]   I'm sorry to have nailed you like that, but--
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.280]   I guess a mini Emmy would be a memory to me.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.280]   I can't even read it.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.280]   I mean, I can't even read it.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.280]   It's a mini.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.280]   I can't even read it.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.280]   I can't even read it.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.280]   It's a mini.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:50.520]   It's a property of and rights are reserved by the National Academy of Television Arts
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.520]   and Sciences.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.840]   I can't even show this Emmy on the air.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.840]   You just can't sell it.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.360]   I think that's the big deal.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.920]   It is manufactured by RSO and it's a company Chicago, Illinois 603630.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.480]   Well now we know who to order a new one from.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.000]   Well also, like if--
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.200]   Is this reproducing it if I show it?
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200]   No.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.200]   No.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.520]   But you won that like before--
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.520]   Travel Emmy.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.840]   It's a travel Emmy.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.840]   You nailed it.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.800]   I'm saying that there's nothing on that sticker that says you can't use your phone to do one,
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.760]   two, three-D catch, make it with three.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.760]   Model and print as many kinds as you can.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.760]   Oh.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.760]   We could do that.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760]   I like it.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:31.440]   We thought today would be the day that the big announcement that Apple was acquiring beats
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:38.200]   for $3.2 billion, they said the-- around Tuesday, maybe tomorrow.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.560]   I'm on record saying it's bogus.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.400]   It's a bogus rumor that these sources are Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.200]   But I don't know.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.920]   OK, I mean obviously that's the biggest story to talk about.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.400]   You've got your ear to the railroad tracks.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.240]   You know Leo, we actually have it on tape.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.240]   Let's see it.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.240]   Oh crap.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:04.440]   It was a rumor created by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine in an attempt to sell headphones and
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:10.120]   stock or whatever and to drum up, gin up some interest in a company that is actually failing.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.120]   Failing.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.120]   Failing.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.120]   That's what I--
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   Thank you to our editors.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.120]   You're doing too far?
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120]   Way too far.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.120]   So I'm on record.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.280]   You're going to send editors from Fox News or something because that's a well-turned-be
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.280]   promotion.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.720]   We're going to save that.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.120]   And then when they actually announce it, we're going to play that so I can be completely
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   humiliated.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.920]   Or John Stewart can play it.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.920]   Yeah, right.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920]   Exactly.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.080]   Hey, I think it's a bogus rumor.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.440]   I think Dr. Dre is right now secretly laughing as he listens to all of this.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:46.240]   And B, if it is not a phony rumor, then it is a clear sign that Apple has completely
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.240]   run out of ideas.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.480]   All right, there was a big story this week that happened the day after Mac Break Weekly
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.440]   last week that we didn't really get a chance to talk about.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.320]   Today was eclipsed by WWDC.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.280]   But real briefly, let's talk about Beats.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.520]   The deal wasn't a rumor.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.560]   It wasn't a false rumor.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.560]   It was true.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.920]   It sold for $3 billion.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.800]   Most of that going towards the headphone business.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:12.800]   I've seen some interesting speculation that in fact, Beats was in financial difficulties
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.360]   and that they needed to sell.
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.800]   Only one of the analysts has said that.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.560]   But an interesting point of view.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.440]   I stand by my initial reaction.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.520]   There's a terrible idea.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.680]   And I'm shocked that Apple did it.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.360]   Obviously it wasn't a false rumor, but it's still a terrible idea.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.720]   Tim Cook was not wearing Beats on stage.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.720]   Lee, I'll look closely.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:29.720]   We just see Dre briefly.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.040]   I was up here from him.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:37.040]   He called Dre and Dre made him wait until the third ring to answer.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040]   Oh, boy.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   That's a baller baller baller.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   And he called him doctor.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.880]   And he also said, what time do I show up for work on Monday, sir?
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.560]   The thing, and you touched on this, at recode Jimmy Iovine at EQ, take the stage.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.960]   Jimmy Iovine, or no, it was at EQ, said music is dying.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.360]   This is so manifestly not true.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.400]   What's true is that the music industry, as we knew it, is dying.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:03.480]   And this seemed to me a music industry bailout bill more than anything else.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.240]   This is not the kind of-- Jimmy Iovine, his old school music industry.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.880]   And I don't think this is the guy you want to bring back.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.400]   He said we want to bring back the album.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.600]   Steve Jobs single-handedly killed the album with 99-cent singles.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   And now we're going to Apple to bring the album back?
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.600]   That doesn't seem like a good thing.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   I don't necessarily his motivation.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.400]   From what he said from his motivation is $3 billion.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.720]   Well, but he also remember that--
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.080]   He even took $205 million out of the $500 million carlile deal.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.760]   They wanted $5 million each.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:34.760]   They took out of that.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.840]   And making Tim Quickway for three rings is a ballroom move.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.320]   But here's the thing that gives me a little bit of pause.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.880]   And this is why when I saw the terms of the deal, I clarified some of my thinking
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:50.240]   on this, that imagine what it would have taken for Steve Jobs to sell Apple to somebody
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.400]   else and then become an employee of that business.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.080]   That was not his original technology business.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.080]   And he didn't sell the company.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.440]   I know that he sold next to Apple, but that's as he sold him to him.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.720]   He sold his company back to a company he founded next month.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:12.680]   Imagine if he sold next to a music business and then became a music industry officer.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.680]   What would that say?
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.240]   Jimmy Ivey seemed to do the exact same thing.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.880]   He walked away from a 25-year career in which he is a legend in that business, not just
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.480]   for making money, but also having the right ideas and being someone that both artists
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.920]   and executives respect.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.040]   The idea that he's willing to dump out of the music industry business to become an employee
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:33.320]   at Apple, I think that says to me that he wanted to...
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:37.840]   I think that says to me that this is about headphones, this is about accessories, this
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.200]   is about a streaming business, this is about his ability to negotiate.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:47.880]   But all the other big factors, this is about beats' attitude and opinions about technology
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.840]   and industries adding to Apple's own experience.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.680]   I really think that Apple decided to expand their mind by buying beats as much as acquiring
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.680]   a couple of different suits.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.760]   Time will tell, but that's just a guess to work on my part, but that seems to make sense.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.480]   I can think of no reason why this makes any sense.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.480]   Not makes sense to me.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.600]   Apple can't afford to throw away $3 billion on the possibility that there might be something
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.600]   there.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.600]   Maybe it's an experiment for them.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.600]   Not a lonely experiment.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.840]   I congratulate Jimmy Ivey and Patrick Dre for being the happy recipients of this experimental
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   money.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:23.080]   I think one of the things though is that the streaming market is very new, it's very small.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.700]   Regardless of how many people we're talking about and Spotify or whatever, in the grand
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:30.080]   scheme of things, it's very small, it's still very early and it's very crude.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.760]   What Spotify does, what Pandora does is crude and barely works.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.120]   We're very excited about the rule that we get.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.760]   The thing is there's a lot of opportunity for disruption that these guys have.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:44.120]   I don't know whether they're going to actually disrupt things, but there is a lot of opportunity
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:52.520]   there because the services that we have right now are medium at best and very ripe to be
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.520]   turned upside down.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:12:00.000]   I think it was Philip Elmer DeWitt who quoted an analyst who had some fairly negative things
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.280]   to say about this.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:07.000]   The Carlisle Group, which is a merger and an M&A group bought Beats.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.520]   The impression I got was to save Beats.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520]   Well, to flip it.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520]   To flip it.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520]   That's what M&A does.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.520]   To flip it.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:19.480]   Part of the reason was Beats had mortgaged their IP and their name to borrow money.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:24.760]   Apparently, when they moved from monster headphones to in-house, the margins went way down.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.840]   This may not be the solubrious deal that people think it is.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.800]   I think Apple the margins probably will go back way back up.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:35.040]   Again, with Apple, Apple brings hundreds of millions of credit cards, people who've already
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.720]   bought a lot of music and they apply that to a streaming service.
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:44.440]   The thing is that 10 million paying customers with Spotify is a drop in the bucket compared
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440]   to where it can be.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.880]   The thing is, for the music industry, it does not pay off to be on Spotify when there's
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.680]   10 million paying users.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.920]   It does pay off.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.240]   The subscription service does pay off when there's 150 million users that are paying.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.360]   That's one of the money quotes that I have invited during the Code Conference saying that
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.360]   Spotify has 10 million users in the world.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.360]   That's crazy.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.360]   There should be 10 million in the US.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.360]   It should be a much bigger market.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.360]   It should be 150 to 200 million.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.680]   The music goes to Eddy Q, the hardware, the headphones goes to Phil Schiller.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.000]   None of their stuff has global reach.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.800]   None of their stuff has global manufacturing yet.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.920]   There's a lot of things Apple can do to just leverage the heck out of those brands.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:27.960]   Imagine the Mon Shark Tank and Eddy saying, "You're doing exactly the wrong model here
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.240]   because I think that you're doing high markup stuff.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.040]   You should be doing, you've got no international distribution.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.040]   I'm out."
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.120]   I do hope 3 billion for 100% of your company.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:40.360]   I do hope that Jimmy Iavine doesn't represent the old school music industry coming into Apple
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.400]   and saying, "Hey, here's how we got to do it from now on."
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.280]   I just feel like that's exactly the wrong direction.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.200]   I feel like they wouldn't have made that offer to give him such a prominent spot on
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.320]   the executive team if he had not shown an ability to work with Apple.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.680]   You don't less long an Apple as an iconic class.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.600]   He's been working with Apple for a long time.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:03.200]   He's the part of why all these deals got done in the first place.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.160]   It's not like they just went to Beats.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:10.400]   Do those deals follow Beats or do they stay?
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.400]   Do they leave?
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.840]   Are those not that the streaming music deals are that important?
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.960]   I think they're very important.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.560]   I think the streaming music deals are part of the part of the biggest about whether they
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560]   go with Beats.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.560]   I've seen different reports.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.200]   I've seen completely opposite answers.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.400]   I don't know what the answer is to that.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.640]   I don't think they have to.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.960]   I think that if they don't change the service, I think Apple can own the service as an ownership
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.360]   without making it part of iTunes and I think that they would retain all those.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.360]   They're keeping the brand.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.800]   They're doing a lot of things to have it almost.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.600]   They're file-makering it, basically.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:45.680]   I can't wait to the fault we see a Beats branded something to see how they integrate the Apple
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.480]   brand because there's no sort of history with Apple integrating other brands into their
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.480]   own umbrella.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.200]   Again, their Siri, there's file-maker.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.200]   There's not iTunes.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.040]   Is it something I'm doing?
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.960]   iTunes is also considered a brand.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.760]   They said they're not doing that.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.760]   How so?
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.760]   Apple said they're going to maintain the Beats brand.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.760]   They're not going to integrate it.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.280]   But I'm saying, would they treat it as though it's an in-house product or were they treated
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.280]   as though something that here's an in-house product?
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.280]   I thought they were very clear.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.280]   They can't stand alone.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.080]   They can't monkey too much with it because they're people who coming in as fans of Beats.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.280]   One of the most compelling things that I came across is-
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.280]   All you're buying is a brand.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.440]   Well, there are people who have switched over their idea.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.640]   Their aspirational thing is someday I'll be able to buy my own Apple thing.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.520]   That's a lot of that I switched over to someday I'll be able to own my own pair of Beats headphones.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.400]   I didn't find in a bus terminal.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.920]   So if they monkey too much with that brand, then they will make that disconnection of-
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.200]   Christina Wormitt had a great post where she wrote about how-
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.640]   It used to be the iTunes everyone wants and now is the Beats everyone wants and owning that
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.640]   brand affinity.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.280]   Well, as we well know, fashion is very fickle and the fashion trends don't last that long.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.680]   I heard a bunch of fashion people, Leo.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.320]   They can make them golden next year.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.320]   I was-
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.920]   That's a lot of money to spend on something that might not be very hip and six months.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.520]   I was outside of Walgreens yesterday and I was walking and I saw a guy with a pair of
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.720]   Beats headphones who also had an iguana on the top of his head.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.480]   And I took a picture because I thought it was the freakiest damn thing I ever saw in
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.880]   a bad use of the Beats logo.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:12.400]   I think that the real answer to this is a billion A what it used to be and three billion
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.880]   A what it used to be and it was chicken feed for Apple and it was an experiment.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.880]   Maybe it's a failure.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.760]   And even if they get absolutely nothing out of it, which is exactly what they're going
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:25.960]   to get, Jimmy and Dre are going home in about five weeks, they said three billion so what?
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.720]   They made more money than that last week.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.720]   I like to see Apple taking some risks in that area too.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.960]   I mean, I think that I like to see them trying to do something down that path and taking
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:34.960]   some risks.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.960]   Is there any risk really?
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.760]   I mean, there's just none for them.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.760]   There's no real.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.760]   There's not money.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.640]   So they can remake that money just by selling a lot of high priced headphones.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.240]   It's just a lot of lots of time and focus.
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.240]   It's the worst.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.120]   The worst of all possible outcomes is they lose a year of time.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.240]   I hear MC Hammer is available.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.040]   No, it's Samsung is going to buy ice cube and bow.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.960]   This time next year.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.000]   It is something I hadn't thought about.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.360]   If Apple was aware enough about Beats to know that you're making money but wow, you're
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.440]   running your business poorly.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:06.160]   We ran it, we could make so much more money out of you and we would pay this off in about
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.160]   two years.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.240]   So that's something I'm not a business reporter so that's the first time I really thought
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.240]   about that.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:19.840]   Yeah and the one negative analyst report was from Sam Haggadah of Proofco who is somewhat,
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.000]   there's some question about how accurate.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.720]   I mean, you know, analysts, we don't know.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.080]   If Angela Aron's can sell Beats in China, Leo, is it the problem solved?
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.240]   Just put a little plaid on them.
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.040]   I think it's a terrible idea.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.000]   I think it's a huge mistake and in my mind it's very reactionary.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   It's exactly the wrong direction.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   Well, should we?
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.520]   No, I'm certainly not saying this in a hostile way but I'm wondering that that is an interesting
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.840]   comment that to see if both of these executives are still working on Apple in five or six
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.840]   months.
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.840]   I think that they will be.
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:53.360]   I think they will be because again it doesn't seem like, okay, well, we're for flagship
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.280]   purposes and make this look good.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.440]   We have to sort of have an office and make sure my car is seen pulling into your driveway
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.440]   every Tuesday.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440]   That was a great.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.840]   It'll be it will be interesting.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.720]   I think that if if if if I have been still with Apple in January or February, that will
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.520]   really lead to a lot of I believe this is a real deal and that would be the best conclusions
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520]   I agree.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.480]   And I think I think we're going to see what they're planning in the fall.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.960]   I will say I will say I was wrong.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.040]   Where is Andy's hat?
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.040]   That's question number one from the questions on air team.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.040]   You can show this.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:31.000]   But where is Andy's hat tech for hire poses, but it got 14 up votes.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.680]   The up votes are what makes us a question pop to the top.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:41.520]   I will I will tell you that I usually I usually shower three to five times a week and almost
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.280]   never on Tuesday because I've got lots of things coming on Tuesday.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:48.160]   And today I happened to shower and shampoo and condition and whatever.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.000]   And so I wear a hat on camera when I feel as though my hair is an absolute fright when
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.640]   it's not a total fright or at least beyond my standards of absolute fright.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:01.600]   Then I believe that you know, you don't want to be the guy who will refuses to be seen
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.880]   without like something on their head.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.520]   Chad says forget the hat.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:09.200]   Where's the squirrel?
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:14.280]   He's he's he's both getting he's he's he's in he's in Tokyo working on a pixel core project.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   I'm going to say done.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.720]   He's he's on the NDA.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.640]   I didn't so I'm not allowed to.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:24.640]   But there's your answer.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.640]   I'm collecting the done button.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.640]   We're going to pop the stack one more time and and move to let's see.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.640]   We pop that pop beats now.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.640]   We're back to WWDC.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.640]   Thank God.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:41.640]   I woke up to word that Burger King was buying Tim Hortons and moving the whole shebang to
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640]   Canada.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   I don't know what to do with myself.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   I call shenanigans.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.640]   What was it?
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.640]   It was a huge amount of money.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.640]   It was billions and billions.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.640]   It's like 11 11 billion.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.520]   I don't I'm really donut shop.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.640]   I like Tony Horton so much and I don't like.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.440]   Oh yeah, he loves Tony Horton.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.040]   His favorite hockey player.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.680]   Yes Tony Horton's are going to be a thing Tony.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:04.760]   So the thing is is Tony Horton Tim and Tim Horton are we're the brothers.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.760]   Tim Hortons are going to be a thing.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.760]   Tony Horton.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.760]   So the thing is is Tony Horton Tim and Tim Horton are we're the brothers.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.760]   Tim Hortons takes your belly and pushes it one way.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:14.960]   Yeah, believe Tony Horton pulls it back in.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.960]   So I'm I try to stick a little.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.120]   Tim Hortons is good for neither of our countries.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:23.600]   Leo, what's weird is that they're moving Burger King to Canada.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.600]   We already have a queen.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   We're we're okay.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.600]   We're good.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:29.760]   King and a queen now.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:32.920]   Look forward to seeing more drunken people at hockey fights wearing those paper freak
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:33.920]   free.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.400]   That's a good visual.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.400]   Free advertising.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.040]   We're Jim Dalrumpel's not even here and he's being made fun of.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.480]   Every scott born gave us that gold card at Burger King.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.840]   Yeah, unlimited Burger King.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.640]   I guess it's all over for Scott and his unlimited Burger King card.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.440]   Does any have a card that he can eat free forever?
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.440]   Something like that.
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.440]   That was the story anyway.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.440]   I don't buy it.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.480]   I think it was just a good story.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:59.320]   So apparently this is a when it came across the wire.
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.320]   They said it was a tax inversion.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.320]   Yep.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.320]   That's helpful.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.320]   The hell is that?
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.000]   Any tax Canadian dollars must be cheaper.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   It is.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.280]   That's language they use in the first reel of a sci-fi horror movie to explain the thing
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.000]   they can't explain that caused the giant monster to visit upon this.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.080]   It was a tax inversion.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:23.480]   We thought it was impossible in this dimension, but I think we're going to what's happening
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.480]   right now.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.480]   I think that's what cars shark made.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.480]   Oh, it's a tax inversion.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.480]   Isn't it?
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.480]   Very well.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:30.480]   Several inversion.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:36.080]   According to Canadian beaches first, Canadian beaches pretending to be US beaches.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.760]   Several inversion deals have developed this year alone.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:43.440]   US-based Abvee bought Irish drug makers Shire, and then they moved Ireland, right?
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.160]   The idea is you move out of the US because the taxes are the corporate taxes are so
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.160]   higher.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.960]   I think we're pretty generous in our corporate tax structure.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.960]   I don't know.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960]   You say no?
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.960]   No.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:56.960]   No, it's fine.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.960]   It's fine.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.600]   No, it's Canadian corporate taxes like the Canadian civil taxes are.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600]   Adonculus.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.600]   Yep.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:07.280]   I think the United States is pretty close to the highest corporate taxes in the world.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.280]   Really?
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280]   That's why everyone's doing this.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.280]   That's why it becomes a big business.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.280]   It must be.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.280]   I mean, that's proof is in the pudding.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.280]   Right.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.280]   So you should go to Saskatchewan instead of Pennsylvania, Alex.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.960]   I don't have any families to scotch away.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.560]   I'm not really...
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.560]   I'm not moving to Pennsylvania for a tax inversion.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.560]   Doesn't...
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:28.840]   Isn't Canada like kind of practically a socialist nation with things like universal healthcare?
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.200]   How could the taxes be lower in Canada?
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.280]   I think none of this makes sense to me.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.360]   I think it's higher for individuals though, isn't it?
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.360]   Yes.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.360]   Oh, I get it.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360]   Huh.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:46.040]   So that makes them a capitalist communist country.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.760]   It makes us very cold in winter and very happy in some...
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.440]   Now, I should point out that Tim Hortons...
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:54.520]   I don't know why we're going on and on about this, but Tim Hortons was owned by Wendy's.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.720]   And theoretically, and I'll argue that they use Max.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.720]   That's why...
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.720]   There you go.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.720]   That's why we're talking about...
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.720]   They have an app.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:05.400]   We're in Delaware until 2009.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:10.360]   And then they move back to Canada shortly after the conservative government.
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.360]   Thank you, Mr. Harper.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.840]   We were repatriated.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.640]   Lowered the corporate tax rate.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.680]   The new company will be based in Canada.
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.800]   It'll be called Burger Hortons.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.400]   There must be a lot of tax on burgers.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.800]   I think there will be a lot of people who are going to whimsically drop the last syllable
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.800]   off of that.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800]   Amen.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.800]   What a good dinner burger whore.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.800]   Talk about your wokker.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.800]   Woo!
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.800]   No, I don't know.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:42.600]   We should restart this show, I think.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.520]   This is from Andre in San Francisco.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:49.400]   What has been the defining moment after 400 episodes of Mac Break Weekly?
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.840]   God, there's so many.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.360]   I think Leo with his laptop.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.360]   Andre's a laptop.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.360]   Thank you, right.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.560]   Me pouring water in my laptop?
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.560]   No, no.
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.760]   Who with your laptop with Steve Jobs giving you the evil, giving you the...
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.760]   Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.960]   No one will ever forget.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:04.960]   That was...
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.760]   Because it changed the iPad announcement.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:10.040]   We haven't seen an invite since 2010.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.760]   I think of Merlin Mann, the King of the Rat Hole playing the guitar.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.480]   I think of Andy playing the ukulele.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.760]   We've had some fine musical moments on this show.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:24.400]   I think of Becky Worley stepping up to Steve Jobs and asking him question on FaceTime.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:30.680]   I'm saying, when our FaceTime protocol is going to go open, like you promised.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.360]   I'm brushing her.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360]   Enough.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.760]   Four questions.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:39.520]   There have been many great moments.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.600]   Scott Borne with his iPhone vest.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.600]   Yes.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.360]   I think that was a Merlin Mann trope.
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.560]   All right, another question.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.560]   Is Yacht Wax?
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.560]   Yacht Wax?
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.560]   Who could forget his Yacht?
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.560]   Scott Borne's Yacht Wax.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:52.040]   Did your Swiss ball break on Mac Break Weekly?
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.040]   Leo, was that a different show?
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.440]   I don't remember that one.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.320]   I think it was a different show.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.600]   That would have been a moment, though, wouldn't it?
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.880]   This show has always been so much fun.
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.200]   And thanks so much to people like Merlin.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:09.880]   I'm so glad to see you again and Andy and Aco, to our founding member and the guy who created
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:16.880]   Mac Break, Alex Lindsey, and to the new kids, Renee Richie.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880]   That's it.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.880]   Just you.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.080]   The new kid.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.080]   Any other questions?
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.080]   I just say that I think we've picked a really good show to end on.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.200]   I'm glad that we're ending it before we start going through that downhill thing.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.000]   And before there's all these rumors about guest hosts.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.840]   I don't want to cut you off, Andy.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.800]   But this is a nation and an industry that the fears are genius.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.840]   This is an industry that is scared of brilliance.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:44.720]   And I want to say, Andy and Aco, as I sit here with you today, it is nice to be with a genius.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.720]   That is what I'm going to say about that.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:48.160]   This is an industry that is full of fear.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.480]   It is not what a triangle thinks.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:54.600]   This is the show that may Jerry Lewis, the star he is today.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.600]   I'm proud to say.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.760]   We told JJ Abrams reboots this thing.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:03.080]   Let me tell you, Merlin, when I got my invitation to be a panel on this show, man, all I wanted
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:08.960]   to know is Tuxedo or Deshiki and what time, because to be on a stage with Merlin Man
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:16.000]   is to know you have arrived in this industry because you do not suffer fools, Merlin Man.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.040]   And this is a time when I'm going to speak from what I call my heart.
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:25.480]   When you have an Andy and Aco, there is no can that can hold that genius.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.960]   Okay, that's number one.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:30.800]   The opener for that can is love.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.800]   It's love.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:34.800]   It's beautiful.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.700]   Oh my God.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:38.000]   Any other questions?
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.520]   We don't get to do our medley, Leo?
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.520]   Yes.
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:51.880]   You know, I think what the world needs now is love and what kind of love?
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.880]   Sweet love.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.880]   Next question.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880]   Oh, cool.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:00.720]   So you're probably keep trying to keep this on focus, Alex, but go ahead and join the
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.720]   best I can.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.720]   Next issue.
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.720]   Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.720]   Issue three.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.720]   Issue three.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:08.720]   Show three.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.960]   I hope you've enjoyed this edition of our holiday edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.160]   We love doing this every year, taking the best events.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.600]   I want to thank everybody who wrote in with your suggestions for the best moments on
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.600]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.600]   They have been so many.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.160]   It's such a fun show to do.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.720]   I want to thank our regular hosts, Andy and Aco, Alex, Lindsey, Renee, Richie for helping
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.240]   me make a great show for you.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.360]   I hope you've enjoyed Mac Break Weekly all year long.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:37.600]   And I promise 2015, it's going to be even better than ever.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.480]   Have a happy holiday and a very happy new year.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.760]   Don't forget we'll be here all day.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.320]   New Year's Eve, 3M New Year's Eve to 3AM New Year's Day.

[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.400]   We'll see you in 2015.
