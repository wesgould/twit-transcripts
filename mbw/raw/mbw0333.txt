[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   this is where we're going to cheer you up about Apple's tumbling stock price the
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   lack of sales of the iPhone 5 and a consumer electronics show that was nothing
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   more than just more cases slightly taller ladies and now I'm depressed.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Ladies gentlemen Mr. Andy and not go from the Chicago Sun time.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   You know Leo and all listeners out there who own Apple stock you know fresh pine
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   apple still tastes like fresh pineapple that God the memory of your grandmother's
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   fresh baked Christmas sugar cookies those are still wonderful and affirming
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and nourishing in his own way so the fact that apples prices now believe it or not
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   a single share of Apple stock is now actually less expensive than many apple
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   products I know that's weird but that doesn't mean that this is going to be a
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   miasma of darkness and what is it joyless over it's over Leo Leo Leo
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   you know again I want you to take off your shoes right now and go well pass it
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   on the right side of the screen about it rather but we're we're here right now
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I'm taking my shoes off I'm going to go downtown Pasadena fine so fine so fine
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   so fine some cool glass grass run around try to step around the hyper dermics
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   in the broken glass that's Pasadena that's not been a little breathing
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   also here from Montreal where hyper dermics are freely available to any
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   addict who needs one mr. Renee Richie of imore.com
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Hey hi Leo how are you doing I'm taking the opposite bent from Andy everyone
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   who's been shorting apple stock and spreading fake rumors so that they don't
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   have to cover it it's party time well done you succeeded winning winning
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   and finally let's say hi to Adam angst of tidbits hey Adam good to see you
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.400]   look at he's at a beautiful this the it looks like an ocean and via are you in
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.000]   Hawaii right now from his office high a top the most about even watching the DC
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   good to have you Adam welcome to the show how are you all it's my first Mac
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   breaking sometime I want to thank Sarah Lane for filling in for me last week
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   while I was slogging through CES in the week before the holidays and the week
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   before that was a best of and I haven't been here in a month but and I'll tell
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   you what since I was here last the apple stock prices gone down over $200
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   so maybe I was just thinking maybe we could wait until it gets even a low
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   wow down 16 bucks today alone probably based on that Wall Street Journal
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   report that iPhone sales are down dramatically there's kind of a battle
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   going on over this though during fireballs John Gruber says hold on there
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   hold on didn't didn't Verizon say that iPhone sales are strong didn't
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Verizon say that they had 9.1 million smartphone activations and a higher mix
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   of Apple smartphones and previously didn't AT&T report its best quarterly sales
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   of Android and Apple smartphones of course both of those reports have
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Android mixed in there which the Wall Street Journal said weaker than
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   expected demand from people familiar with the situation one and a half of them
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   expected by who well that was the question Gruber said
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   expected by whom and what was the expectation all that out I mean they
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   actually had a figure in the original article of 65 million for Q2 which is
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   an outrageous outlandish number but I Q2 standards this not the holiday
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   quarter it's the weaker quarter after that and then they they removed that
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   number but it came back when Reuters and Nikke posted almost identical stories
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   with the 60 by the number that telling so all the Wall Street Journal said is
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Apple cuts orders for iPhone parts Apple has cut its orders for components
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   for the iPhone 5 due to weaker than expected demand and if you read that
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   without that 62 million what you might say is oh Apple's the iPhone is not
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   selling very well but that's not what this says no and it's cute John's
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   quoting numbers from Q1 because that's the giant massive quarter that they
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   report on at the end of the month and these are Q2 numbers and Q2 is usually
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   much smaller than Q1 I think it was 15 some odd million two years ago 30
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   million last year but there is no universe real or imagined where Apple
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   would expect to sell 65 million I mean absent the China mobile deal or some
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   why did they but that would be an error then if they if they had that
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   did they have that expectation did they have orders to fulfill of that number
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I mean one and a half people said they did one and a half said it's really
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   down ripple in the loop says Apple cannot respond to these rumors even if it
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   wanted to do the SEC rules Apple can't just say no no it's not true it's not
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   true that's not I mean that's not accurate though it's common practice but
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   it's not legal I think Eric Silva silica from Mac rumors expanded on that and
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   they could say something if they wanted to it was just a general practice not
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   they're kind of in a quiet period leading up to their quarterly earnings which
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   will be a week from tomorrow you know and that's what that's what Gruber says
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   he's I mean the bottom line on this is somebody's going to be embarrassed in
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   a week and it'll either be the the Bulls who say oh no this is this is nonsense
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Apple's doing great or the bears who are saying the iPhone 5 is not selling
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   that well certainly the stock market believes it because as I mentioned
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   the beginning of the show I don't know by the way this isn't really a data point
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   well it's a data point but I don't know how valuable it is as a data point
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   it's just the stock market yeah but down to 485 you know I mean it's what's what's
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   what's the 65 million number I mean there's been this claim that Apple would never
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   sell that many in a quarter but who says that they have to buy for a quarter at
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   once they may be placing orders on down the line to to solidify position you
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   know to solidify stock I mean Apple will often buy in large bulk so they could
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   be buying this for a year in advance right they're gonna be building
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   building phones that have that form factor and they may have decided that
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   maybe they didn't need to buy a year in advance they're gonna buy six months in
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   advance and cut it in half yeah I mean I was I happen to be traveling yesterday
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   and I when I when I came back when I took the train back home and I've got those
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   three hours where I can finally like catch up on all the news I missed I felt like
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   the parent who had left the house in the hands of their kids and come back to
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   find out exactly what has happened why they were spending the weekend away
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   because I read the I read the Wall Street Journal report which immediately made
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   me think for all the reasons that everybody here has been talking about that
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   okay first of all it's one unnamed it's a short unnamed source so although the
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   journal's been good with sources again also realize that this isn't the this isn't
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   like a blog style editorial structure they have to convince a whole bunch of people
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   that this is a good piece of information but still that's still the reliability of
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   a very small core sample they're not going based on hard primary evidence or high
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   hard primary data they're saying here is a bit a component that that we think is
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   being under ordered we don't know that that's necessarily translates to poor
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   sales but we're simply what we're gonna extrapolate like that I thought it was
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   practically it was the sort of thing that's very easy to ignore but you know it's
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   this is why I tend to have a hands-off sort of attitude towards the stock price
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   because it's gonna do what it's gonna do for whatever reason it's gonna it's gonna
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   do what it's gonna do for the company and there's almost no way to predict how
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   that happened if we're gonna get all bent on a shape that this excuse me it's a
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   problem if it causes long-term de-stability for the company but that's not gonna
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   happen to a company like Apple and every time that if you're upset that the stock
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   price is dipping below $500 and you're not an investor you have to also if you
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   if you if you're gonna take it that that means that the popularity of Apple
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   products is waning then you also have to say that well that when the stock price
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   me with the problem when we were when it was 200 points higher that means that
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   oh well that's the that's that's a sign of Apple's complete strength it had nothing
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   to do with the design of their products that nothing to do with their their core
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   strategy we're gonna use this number as the only metric of whether we have faith
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   in this company so it's just I mean it's the sort of baseball that I'm just not
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   interested in the stands for one thing that's worth pointing out is that we won't
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   really find out about this when Apple does their earnings because they're gonna
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   put a key one earnings and these are the numbers so that's at least three months
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   out but there was this really great video from Jim Kramer 2010 that explained
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   how he manipulated rim and Apple stock prices and how easy it was to do by just
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   calling different people and that doesn't seem to have changed when you look at
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   all the rumors and you look at how the stock prices go up and down the wall street
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   journals masthead was on this story I think lent it a lot more credibility than
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   would have otherwise because it really smelled like those kinds of I have a friend
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   of a friend and I'm putting this order here in that order there kind of don't we know
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   who's shorting in large quantity and how much they're shorting or is that not is
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   that a public information can't you kind of don't you kind of know who's gonna
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   benefit from this I don't know how this stuff well even if it's not in large
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   quantities I think you know with the accusations like this I think the SEC
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   looks very very dimly on this sort of thing and so if there's any indication
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   that it was actually done intentionally someone's gonna be really really
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   in trouble although you maintain that they don't understand the way that this being
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   this is done in an information age the SEC does not yeah the SEC can't handle it
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   you can't handle logs work and yeah absolutely all right well let's step back
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   then a little bit from that story knowing that in fact a we don't know
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   what it means or whether it's true we don't even know whether it's true but even if
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   we're true we don't know what it means all we do know the stock bar is going
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   down but that only means that maybe there's some investors who are who believe this
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and some who don't but I okay I'm gonna give you pure from purely anecdotal
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   point of view it does feel like to me far more people are willing to look at
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Android than were in the past that there are significant numbers of defections
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   from the iPhone that the iPhone 5 was not a particularly inspiring update given
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   that it was the big update as opposed to the you know the minor update and then
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   I wouldn't be to me it doesn't sound surprising that iPhone 5 sales might be
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   soft do you do you disagree Renee I would quibble a little bit and say I think
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   the iPhone 5 was a fantastic update but I don't think iOS 6 was in any way
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   inspired especially with what we saw with stuff like Android 4.0 jelly bean and I
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   think that the market is widening and Android is taking a lot of that widening
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   market and I think that's the area that Apple has to concern themselves with not
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   so much the physical goods they're making anymore because we've gotten to the
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   point where almost any phone is good enough for the mainstream user now and
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   it's really the software and especially the services when you have things like
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Google now and you have things like search and all these different things that we're
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   doing with our phones every day and that's the area Apple's gonna have to pay a lot
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   of attention to this year you don't think the fact that the the four inch screen
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   of the iPhone I mean they made it a little bit bigger but it's pretty clear the
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   trend is towards larger screens much larger in my case here's the thing for me if I
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   walk into Best Buy and every television set regardless of size cost the same thing
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   which is what happens in a subsidized cell phone market at a carrier store
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   a lot of people would just buy the biggest television set they get into their house
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   you get more seems like more and in like the Lumia 920 is actually half the price
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   of the iPhone 5 and it's got a giant screen and a lot of carriers list by spec
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   and some carriers are motivated or have better remunerations for selling some
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   phones more than others so given those conditions I think the large screens
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   have a lot of appeal for people who actually want a large screen but for people who
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   don't care but see a large screen is better value and traditional Apple advantages
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   are you know you know are not a Siri for instance has been basically matched by
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Android's text speech to text the camera that was you know always so good on the iPhone
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   maybe it's still the best but it's only the best buy a little bit well that's I think
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   that I believe that the camera right now is the only thing they've got going that is
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   absolutely without any real argument the best in class if you if that is the metric
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   that you really want to judge a phone by you really want nothing other than an iPhone
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   even the Lumia 920 has a camera that can absolutely spank the iPhone in a
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   couple of situations but on a broad carry a broad range of stuff the camera is still
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   good but the problem is the real problem is that it's very very hard to create a compelling
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   case that the iPhone 5 hardware is better than a top tier like multi-core
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Android phone it's hard to make the case that iOS 6 is better than Android 4.1 or
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   4.2 especially you can make the case that it's better for some users just like
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   kicking but you have I think you really now have two platforms that are on
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   absolutely equal footing and it's that point at which someone will say well if I like
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   these two phones equally maybe I may as well get them on with the big screen
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   because it's going to be easier to read oh well look at look at look at the first
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   thing I'm going to launch is the Kindle app oh look they're few I have to do
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   fewer page turns on this app than I do on the iPhone so that's where they're vulnerable.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I really think this is a year in which Apple is going to have to really refocus on
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   restoring the iPhone to a place where we can say yes this is better than the
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   majority of the other hands out there that hasn't been true for several months now.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   The other thing that I think really does come into play here though is the iPhone
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   5 is competing against the 4s and the 4 and as a result the if you just want to pay less
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   for a phone it's really easy to buy an iPhone without buying an iPhone 5 and
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   similarly the jump from the 4s to the 5 even though it's a number jump is not that great
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   you know that it's really comes down to just the screen and some thinness and so
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   you know people aren't going to be upgrading from that too much and Apple doesn't really
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   want you to I mean Apple is very much on a two year upgrade cycle so you know if the iPhone 5
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   sales aren't quite up to snuff I think that really that you want to look at the cannibalization
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   on the lower end models as well.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   I'm going to say something that people are going to get mad at because I like to stir up trouble.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   I think that the what we've been waiting for worried about is actually happening
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   that Apple has lost its mojo after losing Steve Jobs and I think this is the beginning
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   of a long decline. I think this I think no it's not too soon. I think I would have
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   been too soon a year ago is to is I think this is exactly what we're seeing now and I think that
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   you will you will be able to say that the day the iPhone 5 came out is the day that became
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   apparent that Steve Jobs was Apple and without Steve Jobs Apple's back to the bad old days.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Well what do you have done? I don't think we've seen anything here that Steve Jobs would have
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   done differently up until this point.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Like these are probably the devices that he was the last devices. Yeah these are his last
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   device. Yeah that's why I said that's well also I think I think that the real the real issue here is that
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   when you get down to it the iPhone 5 all the features that it has the form factor it has apart from it being
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   super super thin is pretty much any phone that you could describe that have been released up to a year before
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   and so much of why each release of every iPhone after the first one seems so significant and seems so transformative was because it went from being just
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   just an edge phone to 3G went from being 3G to LTE it went from having a kind of crummy resolution screening camera to a wonderful
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   resolution screen camera. So the problem is that now they're at a stage where they have to really I wouldn't say reinvented but they have to
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   figure out what can we learn from the past good God six years of iPhone history that will allow us to make iOS 10 let's say and the iPhone
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   8 let's say something that no current user of the current operating system and phone would even recognize but would instantly dump whatever
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   they've got in their hands right now in favor of so it's we can't allow ourselves to believe that Apple absolutely reinvented the phone
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   every time they went at it so maybe this is as good as it gets for now and until they find a good device going to replace it this is what we're kind of stuff with
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   well yeah the pressure is on the apps now I agree with you except that I think Android has he has a laptop apple right but it's like what
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   okay so let's say Steve Jobs is still in the saddle and he's still as hands on as he was before what would they do to the iPhone that would not have been done already
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I'll tell you exactly what they should do in in May or June is they should release an iPad mini with phone capability
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Oh right now with phone dot app built into it yeah and an asim card or whatever it takes to in other words they should make a mini iPhone
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   they're gonna they're gonna tell you great we've got FaceTime it's even better than using a telephone what's next I honestly think that that's what that's what holds the app I'm not gonna get into what Steve would have done cuz I have no idea what Steve would have done no one knows of course the apple the apple that the apple that I've just like you kind of configure
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   the movie Quentin Tarantino would make next what kind of a movie Spielberg would make next right you know and if I were to figure out what they would what move this director this creator this producer would make it would be the person who says why do we need a phone carrier anyway why wouldn't you want something that could evolve far faster than the phone networks good so I'm not sure if that's what they would do I would think I do think that you know you've even you were mentioning that probably the note too this is I do think that they need to experiment with different
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.860]   to experiment with different form factors
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.700]   because this size device is very, very, very compelling.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.580]   >>I've been using it-- >>I've been using it
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.360]   for a year and a half and I have to say people laughed
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.720]   a lot at me when I started using it.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.820]   And it tastes so, it tastes so well.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.660]   You gotta go, "What are you?
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.740]   What you want such a big thing for?"
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.740]   It looks like a family-sized Hershey bar on your head.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.500]   But what's happened is people say as they gradually
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.040]   gotten exposed to it and started to use it.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.720]   "Oh, this is good."
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.400]   And I think this time, maybe Apple should leapfrog this.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.280]   I think people want something big.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.960]   They wanna take one device that is at both a tablet
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.560]   and a phone.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.080]   And I disagree that FaceTime is sufficient.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.800]   >>I think there's two interesting things at play here.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.840]   Apple is almost never the early adapter,
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.280]   so they're probably content to let Samsung release
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.360]   screen sizes at quarter-inch increments
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.560]   and see which ones like the Note or Huawei's
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.800]   new six-inch, phablet phone are gonna take off
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.360]   while pretending not to watch at all.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.200]   >>Well, absolutely.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.600]   And they'll pick the two models that have the best
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.640]   addressable market for them.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.320]   And then maybe there'll be a four-inch and a five-inch
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.760]   and that'll be it the way we got an iPad mini.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.400]   But the other thing is that Apple still has to address,
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.160]   Apple used to have the lock-in that they had
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.160]   because of their ecosystem.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.280]   But now companies like Samsung and LG
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.360]   who also make ovens, like the big joke at CES
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.800]   was the Android powered oven.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.680]   But it's not a joke.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.280]   You have a vacuum cleaner controlled by Android.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.280]   You have a refrigerator controlled by Android.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.040]   And your phone on your way home can vacuum for you
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.640]   and remind you to pick up milk and do all these things.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.240]   And because these huge conglomerates make so many
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.080]   different appliances and devices,
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.320]   they can offer a very compelling ecosystem
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.960]   that's even bigger than the one that Apple
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.960]   used to have with the Media Hub.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.920]   >>Yeah, but that's not an ecosystem
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.480]   that people have expressed any interest in yet.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.480]   It's a long list of technologies including
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.240]   like 3D video glasses, laser projection keyboard,
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.440]   and to a certain extent voice control
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.480]   that they're cool ideas they make for a great demo.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.960]   You would think that people would want something like this,
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.080]   but nobody has ever, no consumer has ever said
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.560]   that this is exactly what I want in product.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.760]   But it's both companies have a certain degree of power
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.800]   in exercising their leverage.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   Samsung in the sense that we can make whatever we want
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   and we are a big enough company that doesn't,
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.840]   that we don't have all of our fortunes.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.440]   Our stock price is not going to go down
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.120]   because we produced this phone and this phone
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.040]   did not sell as well as analysts predicted
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.560]   because they've got four other phones
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.320]   and 12 other toaster ovens right behind it.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.920]   >>That's a big strength. >>That's a big strength.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.520]   >>Apple has the same thing going on
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.120]   where they can leverage their control not in other hardware
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.880]   but in other forms of content.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.200]   And one of the problems that they're facing is that
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.920]   there was a time when if you wanted music,
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.400]   of course you're going to go through the iTunes store,
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.440]   where else you're going to go.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.240]   If you want to get movies, of course you're going to go
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.600]   to the movies and television,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.640]   you're going to go to the iTunes store,
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.720]   where else you're going to go.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.680]   Now that stuff is being licensed out to so many libraries
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.840]   that you have a great many options.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.000]   And now that you have companies like Amazon
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.880]   that can do really weird things like say,
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.040]   well tell you what, you can buy our music digitally
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.680]   or if you buy it on CD, we'll send you the CD
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.760]   and we'll also give it to you digitally.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.480]   These are things where apples have to figure out
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.600]   what their core story is and make sure that they're telling
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.680]   that story in a way that's really clear and compelling.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.960]   They're losing, I know that they're losing a lot of people.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.000]   I've know a lot of people who were real
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.720]   died in the wool apple folks.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.640]   I'm not talking about myself here, but really,
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.560]   who never thought that they would switch to Windows,
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.040]   never thought that they'd be using an Android device.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.240]   But now they're like, you know what, I, you know, I,
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.520]   we switched to, we had the option of buying
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.320]   a different kind of phone, I tried it for a month
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.080]   and now, damn it, I'm switching to Android
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.960]   or now I really like Windows 7 because of the,
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.600]   there's this style of tablet, there's this style of computer
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.480]   that I really, really like that Apple doesn't make
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.480]   and has no interest in making, but I want it so I got it.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.120]   Or come the end of January when Blackberry 10 launches,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.760]   Apple will have the oldest major mobile operating system
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.560]   on the planet and that's in position.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.920]   They've never been-- - That's an interesting way
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.280]   of putting it, isn't it?
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.560]   Who would have thought that?
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.600]   Plus, I'm sorry, go ahead, I interrupted, go ahead.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.920]   - I'm sorry. - No, I was probably
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.360]   gonna say something very similar, you know,
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.720]   and Blackberry was once a very powerful company
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.280]   and an Apple has shown that powerful companies
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.720]   can come back and they have a lot of interesting ideas.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.920]   And it looks like we're approaching a next transition
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.360]   where, you know, people joke about icons on a grid,
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.120]   but widgets on a screen, all these things
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.480]   are old generation technology.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.720]   It's a way to pull information and we're moving
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.800]   into a push information era with things like Google now
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.720]   and series not there yet, but it could be.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.320]   And iOS 7, I think, is gonna be absolutely key for Apple
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.400]   because they're gonna need to leapfrog again.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.520]   They're gonna need to take interface places
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.880]   like with actionable notifications and things
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.000]   that really allow us to have the data brought to us
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.200]   so that it's not just a battle between who has
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.560]   the bigger screen anymore, but Apple's once again
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.280]   doing what they say they do in their DNA,
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.680]   which is great software to sell their hardware.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.640]   - Yeah, and then Blackberry.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.760]   - For all these hardware, all these hardware,
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.160]   you know, what would it take for you to switch?
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.040]   Is it really hardware or is it that larger ecosystem?
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.920]   I mean, the thing that's been getting me recently
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.840]   about Apple is the level to which they're forcing us
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.480]   into the ecosystem that once you do one thing,
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.120]   you're stuck in with the rest of it
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.000]   and you just don't have any alternatives at all.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.600]   And, you know, I mean, I don't want my vacuum cleaner
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.880]   to be ordering my milk, but nonetheless, you know,
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.840]   there are other possibilities that it feels like
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.240]   could come up and Apple would just simply not approve the apps.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.560]   And suddenly that whole alternative is just not available.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.560]   - Yeah, I definitely agree with you there.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.720]   I myself made, I've had to restructure a bunch
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.360]   of different ways about how I run my office
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.200]   and how I run my creative business.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.240]   And one of them is that, okay, I finally need to have
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.080]   a core central notes app.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.680]   I need a way to track and schedule these sort of things.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.800]   And what I started off with was, of course,
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.120]   reminders and notes on iOS.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.960]   - You can't do it.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.840]   - And after I started using that for about like a month
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.280]   and realize, okay, I can make the system work,
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.040]   it became important to me that I switched to Evernote
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.440]   because I knew that if I build my business around notes
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.840]   and reminders, I will never be, have the freedom
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.680]   to choose something that is not an Apple product
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.680]   because Apple's not gonna extend that
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.600]   to make it work with other things.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   So, I mean, it's starting to be the level of control
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.200]   that Apple exerts over their software and hardware
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.240]   has a great many advantages and so many
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.120]   that can't be denied for people who are,
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.960]   they don't really want to learn new stuff,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.680]   they don't wanna care about how to make things work
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.240]   absolutely precisely the way they want,
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.600]   they just want something functional again,
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.560]   they want the fleet vehicle that works really well.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.440]   But this is starting, I think there might be,
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.960]   we might be at that part of the curve
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.560]   where we're gonna start a decline
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.880]   where this amount of control that Apple's putting on things
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.560]   is actually limiting opportunities for users to do things
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.360]   instead of an asset, it's gonna forever start
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.600]   and become a disadvantage.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.640]   I mean, and the problem is that when you have had
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.600]   the same thing going for the same reasons
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.680]   without a lot of really visible,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.320]   I'm underscoring the word visible innovation,
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.600]   that really leaves a platform vulnerable
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.080]   to someone who comes up with a great idea
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.960]   and Rem is coming up with Blackberry 10
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.320]   at the end of the month.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.720]   The feature that really caught my attention
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.560]   that I had them explain to me like two or three times
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.400]   to make sure they weren't doing this in a lame way
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.800]   was the idea that here is,
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.440]   they're sick and tired of people who have,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.520]   they've got the phone that was issued to them
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.800]   by their company, but they also have like their iPhone
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.920]   or their Android phone, their personal device
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.200]   because it's too hard to keep their different rules
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   and regulations and also they don't want the creepy IT guy
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.960]   to get ahold of their family pictures.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.000]   The feature of Blackberry 10 is that essentially
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.120]   this is two separate firewall partitions in one
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.640]   so that it's like the mullet of business phones
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.440]   where it's all business upfront, but it's party in the back
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.320]   and you really don't get the same.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.040]   And so you can basically have one phone
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.280]   that does everything like that.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.080]   That's interesting. - That's very balanced.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.920]   - Yeah, and that's really interesting.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.400]   And if you have people who just as we've been discussing
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.560]   aren't passionate phone users, aren't passionate techies,
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.320]   they just want something functional that works.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.800]   They might find that there are enough apps
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   inside the Blackberry marketplace
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.560]   that all the lifestyle apps and personal apps that I want
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.640]   are there and now I can just carry this one phone around
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.920]   that will just work for me and I don't have to keep
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.680]   two things charged up at the same time.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.120]   So that's a vulnerability when you have one compelling idea
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.600]   that makes people think, yes, I would like to carry
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.760]   just one device, great, my contract's up.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.240]   I think I'll just give this Blackberry 10 a try
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.720]   or at least if my company's supporting it.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.560]   - Here's the other thing, which is I think that Apple
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.840]   has focused very, very hard on the individual
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.600]   and that's great, but that's actually somewhat in contrast
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.960]   to the prevailing trend on the internet now,
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.520]   which is to bring people together to allow collaboration.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.760]   And Apple's thrown in Twitter and Facebook,
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.280]   they can do some of the social stuff,
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.920]   but when it comes to working on interesting things
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.920]   other people, Apple just doesn't make it any easier
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.760]   than, well, certainly in a year's and anyway else,
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.680]   they certainly aren't doing interesting stuff there.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.280]   Whenever you look at the iCloud stuff,
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.080]   it's all your devices, your data,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.040]   and if you wanna share that data with someone else,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.240]   tough nuggies, it just doesn't happen.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.640]   And so to my mind, 'cause I'm actually honestly
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.520]   starting to think, geez, might be my next phone
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.960]   is not going to be an iPhone,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.320]   if there's something compelling about the collaborative
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.360]   capabilities of another system, because that's what I do.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.960]   I spend my entire flipping day talking an email,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.040]   using Skype, using Google Hangouts,
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.000]   all this kind of stuff where I'm working with other people,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.600]   collaborating in Trello, it's all other systems,
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.720]   and that is to a certain extent work in iOS,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.000]   but I just don't feel like Apple cares about that.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.880]   And there's certain level, if they don't care about it,
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.080]   then maybe I'm gonna go looking for someone who does.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.680]   - I think it's important to put in context,
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.920]   I used Nexus 4 throughout CES,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   and while we're piling a little bit on Apple here,
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.600]   Android is just as annoying, Windows Phone is just as annoying.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.320]   None of them, there's, it's huge competition,
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.920]   and I think Andy said this before,
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.760]   all of them have their strong points and weak points,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.880]   there's no ideal solution, and it's gonna be a lot of,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.400]   like Google, for everything that Android is,
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.720]   Android is less significant to Google's business
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.120]   than the Apple TV is to Apple, and Google's leadership,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.000]   they are not as hugely invested in Android
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.640]   as Apple's leadership is invested in the iPhone,
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.680]   it's just not that big a part of their business.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.920]   So people like us are gonna be disappointed
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.600]   no matter which device we have,
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.880]   because we're always gonna want better,
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.400]   we're always gonna want every feature
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.000]   from every phone all in one.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.040]   - Okay, everybody have their say?
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.440]   I killed that one.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.400]   - No, I thought that was great,
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.680]   and I frankly thought you'd all be yelling at me,
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.280]   so I'm glad to see that in fact,
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.680]   I wasn't that far off.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.120]   - You know, we'll watch with interest,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.880]   it's not our job to predict the future,
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.000]   and no one knows what the future's gonna be,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.840]   but I think we all agree there's a challenge ahead.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.760]   - Yeah, well I mean, we'll end with this,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.560]   I'll spank you lightly about the, again,
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.400]   this is what happens when Steve Jobs leaves the company,
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.760]   'cause again, I've never had a taste
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.880]   for that kind of commentary,
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.920]   I mean, we don't know what he would have done,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.840]   we don't know, we realize that most tech companies,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.880]   they aren't led by the same guy for generation
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.320]   after generation, there comes a time at which
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.280]   this person just doesn't, either has a vision
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.280]   that doesn't matter, the users just move away from them,
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.160]   or their level of passionate interest
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.120]   in making this the focus of their life
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.800]   wanes as they realize that,
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.080]   I got $4.8 billion, why the hell am I worried so much
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.840]   about one part that one supplier may or may not
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.520]   be provide us with at the cost that we needed to be,
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.240]   and at that point, you've got to step aside
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.800]   and move it to the other place,
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.760]   I mean, Microsoft has gone through this exact same thing,
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.920]   because Bill Gates has--
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.960]   - Well, I think you can make a case
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.640]   that Microsoft has floundered since Gates left.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.520]   - Well, they went through a middle period,
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.560]   but now in the past two or three years,
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.080]   they emerged from that malaise when the Xbox came out,
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.200]   and it took it a couple years for them to figure out exactly
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.120]   how much potential they had inside the Xbox,
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.760]   but man alive, they've got all the parts
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.240]   to the killer monster robot in three pieces
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.080]   in their backyard, and at some point,
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.840]   Microsoft's got to be on their back porch
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.360]   with their morning cup of coffee to say,
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.400]   "Wait a minute, if I snap that part onto that part,
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.120]   and the mouse on top of that,
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.080]   we could rule the world."
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.920]   Really, all the pieces are right there, so--
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.320]   - Well, I don't want to get an argument
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.480]   about the future of Microsoft,
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.640]   but I think that there is a data point
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.440]   that you can't ignore.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.000]   We've always said Apple's not like any other company,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.120]   that Apple did not do well,
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.000]   has never done well without Steve Jobs at the helm,
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.960]   and I don't think that that's a stretch to say
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   that without his, partly without his vision,
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.120]   but more importantly, without his marketing and his--
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.040]   - His force of personality.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   - His force, it's hard to be as big a winner as Apple is.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.400]   - Mike, that says that it's a normalized Apple now,
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.880]   the way like Pick's Normalize.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.320]   - Lucasfilm has been sold to Disney,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.040]   so we'll never likely get Empire Strikes Back again,
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.920]   or we won't have to suffer with the prequels.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.760]   - Yeah, we don't have to--
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.440]   - Episode one again, I'm happy.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.280]   - Yes.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.120]   - Okay, but-- - We'll never get
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.880]   the higher highest boy, we won't get the lower lows.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.320]   - Right, I don't know if that's true, actually,
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.640]   but that's another story.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.160]   - Can I disagree with you?
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.080]   - Can I pick upon what I feel is a very useful
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.120]   and brilliant analogy?
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:14.960]   - Yes.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.160]   - That yes, I mean, we get the prequels,
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.400]   which disappoint everybody,
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.520]   but then we also get the Clone Wars series,
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.440]   which nobody who grew up watching Star Wars
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.640]   would have conceived of or approved,
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.760]   but once a new generation has,
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.200]   once the old guard is cleared out a little bit,
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.640]   to simply look at what they have to work with
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.960]   and what they could build from it,
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.760]   man, you can get back on your feet in a hurry.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.320]   - Wise as Andy and Otto.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.480]   (laughing)
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.840]   - We're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.640]   I agree, Wise is that one.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.160]   Let's talk about hover.com.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.360]   If you're wise, you're looking for a domain name registrar
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.280]   that's not gonna get in the way,
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.000]   that's gonna get the job done,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.240]   that's gonna simplify domain name management.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.400]   Okay, yes, I admit,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.760]   that hover does not have skin scantily clad girls
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.120]   in their ads.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.960]   Some might say that's a negative,
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.360]   them bother me.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.200]   They do have,
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   what they do have is the best domain name
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.200]   registrar in management ever.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.640]   I want you to visit hover.com/macbreak
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.320]   by doing so, you could save 10%
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.520]   on your next domain registration.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.400]   Browse around though and see what makes hover so great.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.840]   I moved all of our domains from a variety of registrars
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.400]   over to hover and I can't be happier than I am.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.800]   It's just fantastic.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.880]   By going to hover.com/macbreak,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.640]   you'll see you'll activate the promotional code,
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.360]   you'll get the 10% off.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.960]   It's very straightforward,
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.480]   you don't get 50 clicks,
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.680]   all the upselling that you get
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.000]   from other domain registrars.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.160]   Each domain includes unlimited domain forwarding,
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.520]   no charge who is privacy, that's built in,
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.480]   they know you want that.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.760]   So they just include it at no cost.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.240]   Powerful domain, editing, advanced DNS management.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.440]   In bulk, the management system is very clear,
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.680]   very easy to use, I highly recommend it.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.440]   And they have a no hold policy,
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.360]   which means if you get through to hover tech support
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.520]   during regular business hours,
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.320]   once you get through, they will keep you on the line
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.920]   until they solve the problem.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.600]   Hover offers 23 TLDs like .com.net.org
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.880]   as well as .tv.pro.moby.biz,
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.880]   of course, country level, top level domains.ca.asia.us.uk.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.760]   I'm a big fan, I know you will be too.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.880]   Hover.com/macbreak to save 10%.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.480]   Hover's in it for the long haul too,
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.800]   I gotta say they really are the best part of two cows.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.440]   They've been around since 1994,
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.320]   they're one of the largest domain name registrars
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.080]   in the world, and we just wanted everybody
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.680]   to know more about them.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.200]   So I'm really glad to be doing their ads.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   Hover.com/macbreak to save 10% on your next domain name
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.760]   registration.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.760]   You're watching Mac Break Weekly,
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.760]   Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times, Renee Ritchie
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.360]   from iMore and Adamanks from TIDBITS.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.680]   We're talking about the Apple,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.080]   by the way, some good Apple news,
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.520]   Apple won a technology and engineering Emmy award
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.600]   for 2012, or actually they'll receive one,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.920]   they received one at CES, this is the category.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.120]   Ecosystem for real time presentation of TV content
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:28.120]   to mobile devices without the use of special televised hardware.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.720]   I don't know how they could lose that one.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.880]   No antennas, they win, they win.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.360]   So good going Apple, and they've received
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.080]   engineering awards pretty much every year
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.080]   from the Emmys for Firewire for Final Cut Pro.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.760]   Just one day I would like to see them actually
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.840]   handed one of those awards from somebody
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.360]   in the mainstream Emmys show.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.680]   George, someone--
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.000]   Richard, I think--
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.520]   So they should be presented by someone who has
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.120]   a hit show on HBO.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:56.880]   Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.040]   As opposed to--
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.520]   I like it, maybe Lena can give him--
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.120]   Give him two and a half men.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.240]   And I want the woman from Girls.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.240]   She can handle.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   Game of Thrones.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.720]   Game of Thrones, yeah.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.560]   Let's have him have--
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.000]   Edard Stark give them the award,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.480]   and then chop their heads off.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.040]   Apple slash his price on Thunderbolt Cable.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.480]   About time, not exactly slash though.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.560]   Slash, well--
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.560]   It was $50.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.400]   It was $50.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   How much is it now?
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   40.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.840]   It's a cable for goodness sakes.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.640]   You save a lot of money when you stop making them
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.840]   out of printer ink.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.840]   (laughing)
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.400]   I asked a lot of the accessory makers at CES
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.280]   about lightning cables and thunderbolt cables.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.840]   But the story was always the same.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.480]   It's just that these companies were not ready
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.640]   to supply the parts or the people who need to
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.160]   oversee and approve the accessories
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.800]   at anywhere near a responsible rate.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.960]   And we saw that with Apple in the iPhone launch
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.200]   where they put 50 million phones on the shelves,
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.480]   but not a single lightning adapter for months.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   Right.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.160]   I think it was just a complete lack of preparation
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.480]   or investment in the technology
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.520]   they needed to make these things.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.920]   You know what?
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.560]   I would like to know your opinion on this.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.960]   Apple just started selling these,
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.480]   and I bought about a dozen of them.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.400]   They're $19.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.040]   It's a micro USB to lightning adapter.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.440]   It allows you to sync, to charge.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.560]   It does most of what the lightning adapter does.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.920]   It's $19.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.720]   And it really begs the question, Apple,
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.680]   why didn't you use micro USB to begin with?
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.920]   These are great 'cause they're tiny
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.320]   and you just put them right on the cable.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.880]   And you know, 'cause I have 800 micro USB cables.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.720]   What's the--
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.920]   - Lightning does more than micro USB though.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.600]   So it's an intelligent switch and it's got,
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.960]   I mean, the 30-pin legacy stuff had tons of stuff in there.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   There was firewire and HDMI and line in and line out
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.880]   and video in the video.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.560]   - It charges and syncs, which is most of what you want.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.240]   It eliminates what?
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.760]   HTM-like. - Well, it won't do,
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.880]   the car stuff, any of the car integration stuff,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.280]   it won't do any of the--
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   - It doesn't do, so it doesn't do iPod.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.960]   Can't control an iPod with it.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.960]   - Yeah, and anything that Apple builds in going forward,
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.800]   it won't be able to do.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.440]   I would argue that cables are becoming less
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.920]   and less important general because we do all the sorts
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.720]   of syncing and all sorts of airplane,
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.080]   even wireless charging is becoming more and more common.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.800]   So the cable will probably go out of the way,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.160]   but the lightning cable is designed
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.040]   to do far more than a USB cable can handle.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.160]   - My understanding is that lightning to micro USB adapter
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.600]   was also required because of regulations in Europe.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.800]   - Yeah, they have to bundle it in Europe, yeah.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.760]   It just, if I have to say, if iPhone 5 sales
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.240]   are disappointing, some of that,
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.840]   some significant percentage of that has to be people who said,
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.320]   I am not getting a lightning adapter,
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.360]   I'm gonna stick with my 30-pin cable.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.200]   - Oh, I don't know.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.400]   I think if anybody made that decision,
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.360]   they were very foolish.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.680]   I mean, if I cable once and that's it.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.000]   - Yeah, I had bought so many--
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.480]   - I bought $200 worth of lightning adapter cables.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.680]   - Can we see we bitch every week about we want new things,
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.560]   we want what's next and then when companies introduce them,
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.680]   we say, oh, you've obsoleteed everything I used to have.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.800]   So we complain no matter what.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.640]   - No, I may want it,
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.600]   but I'm just saying most normal people are pissed off.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.760]   - Yeah.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.600]   - They're saying, well, I have to buy all new cables,
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.960]   I have to buy hundreds of dollars worth of converters.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.040]   - Oh, is that my stereo box?
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.400]   - Is that not, don't you think normal people
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.680]   kind of look at that and go, why?
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.520]   Do I have to do that?
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.520]   I know, we know why, I understand that.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.480]   - Well, I think that normal people,
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.560]   they have one phone and they're gonna have that one phone
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.760]   for two years and I don't think that,
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.200]   I just don't think it's that big,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.880]   if you include a charging and sync cable in the box
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.320]   with the new phone that you get,
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.760]   I don't think most people are gonna be very, very upset
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.960]   that all of their, that previous, excuse me,
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.160]   that the nightstand clock rate
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.360]   or they bought two years ago doesn't necessarily work with it.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.440]   They might be bummed about it,
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.960]   but I don't think they have that broadened awareness
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.440]   that says that, gosh, they should have kept the same
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.640]   - Well, it wouldn't make much difference
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.480]   if there weren't good competition,
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.360]   good stuff out there as an alternative.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.920]   But I think it's just, I agree, it's not a deal breaker,
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.040]   but it's one more data point
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.520]   that I don't think is a good data point for them,
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.600]   but I've said that for a long time and obviously I'm wrong.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.720]   - If we didn't have the lightning cable,
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.560]   we would have had a thick iPhone 5.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.880]   - No, I understand.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.400]   - Look, I understand why they did it.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.160]   And I'm technically enough that I get it.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.200]   I'm just thinking that that's got to be a reason
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.560]   that some people go, really?
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.720]   I gotta get all new cables and new connectors
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.920]   and it won't work in my car.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.760]   Really? - You only find out
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.160]   when they get home, Leo, they buy it
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.440]   and then they go home and get upset.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.880]   - I think people are smarter than you think.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.200]   I think they actually know.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.160]   Let me put it this way.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.360]   I hear it on the radio show a lot.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.200]   - Yeah.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.480]   - You know, I talk to real people every single weekend.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.120]   And I'm starting to know what baffles them
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.680]   and bothers them.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.520]   That's one thing.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.000]   I have to say kudos to Apple.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.720]   I bought $1,000 27-inch Thunderbolt display
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.040]   and it did include the changed Mags and adapters
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.400]   so I could use my MacBook Pro retina with it.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.920]   - Yeah, I mean, it's little things like I travel.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.360]   - Yeah, that's a stupid.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.200]   - Huh?
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.600]   - That adapter change is just annoying.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.920]   At least of lightning, they said,
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.600]   "Oh, well look, we can make it so much thinner,
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.000]   "but MagSafe 2, it's just not that much different."
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.840]   - There's no point.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.520]   It was just a way to make more money.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.560]   - Just, I don't even think it was a way to make money.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.520]   There must have been some engineering reason for it,
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.400]   but they certainly didn't justify it
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.960]   in any way that made sense.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.440]   They had to bundle that adapter in.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.640]   I was pissed 'cause I thought I had to buy an adapter
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.680]   and then I fortunately had dug through the materials
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.600]   'cause it's this little thing
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.760]   that you could easily throw out.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.560]   - I find it most noteworthy when I travel.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.880]   For example, when I was at CES,
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.240]   the hotel had a dock in the radio and the hotel
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.880]   so you have to have an adapter if you want to use your iPhone.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.520]   - Yeah, what kind of dock did it have?
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.160]   - It's a 30-pin dock.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.760]   When I go to my mom has a CRT TV still
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.520]   and she has Apple's old AV cable
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.640]   and she can plug her iPad into that and watch on the TV
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.680]   and my new iPad just looks at that
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.160]   and screams in frustration.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.720]   - Yeah, no, when you go to a hotel
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.200]   and you see a thousand room hotel,
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.880]   a thousand clock radios with 30-pin connectors,
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.960]   you just shake your head.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:55.880]   So I think either people are gonna buy adapters
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.720]   which is a significant additional cost
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.520]   'cause Apple's not discounting those adapters.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.160]   Anyway, that's an old article.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.280]   - To me it comes to,
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:09.840]   I would be more upset about it if the 30-pin connector
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.200]   weren't so completely different from the lightning connector
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.360]   and so completely different from the mini USB.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.200]   I mean, there's so many different kinds of devices
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.840]   that are really, really difficult for Apple to build
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.880]   if it's gonna support that kind of really big
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.120]   quarter slot style connector.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.920]   I mean, even micro USB, which can also transmit video
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.760]   which can charge and sync to all these cool stuff.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.640]   It's nice and thin.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.320]   It doesn't really control the size
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.840]   and shape of devices you can make.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.840]   So otherwise I'd be saying that,
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.280]   I haven't, I've never tried to wait for me able to say,
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.320]   "Oh, Apple, why do you so often do things
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.320]   "that are just a style thing?"
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.600]   But I think that it's a bitter pill to swallow
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.800]   but that allows better things to happen in the future.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.960]   I would have been more pleased though
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.120]   if they had decided to go with micro USB
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.600]   or at least said, "We're gonna take the micro USB standard.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.400]   "We're gonna add more stuff to it
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.520]   "so that if you aren't using it,
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.480]   "we want a standard so that if you're just charging
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.680]   "any USB will work, if you're just syncing,
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.200]   "any micro USB will work.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.520]   "However, if you buy our special $90 cable,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.600]   "okay, how about the $30 cable,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.840]   "that exploits the extra pins that are inside there,
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.160]   "then you can actually do more with it
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.560]   "than just those two things."
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.000]   I thought that would have been very consumer friendly.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.160]   - I think Nick Naim in our chat room speaks
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.040]   for a number of Apple people who says,
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.240]   "Apple has always been an exclusive club
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.080]   "and I like being a part of it.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:24.640]   "I don't care if they lose market shares
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.240]   "long as they produce killer products."
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.240]   That's the old Macintosh attitude, user attitude.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.680]   Maybe that's the attitude of the future.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.200]   Maybe that's all it really needs to be,
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.080]   is a boutique product.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.720]   - That's the profit share, a boutique products,
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.640]   it's impressive anyway.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.520]   - It's a good profit share, they're profits.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.080]   Well, we'll see in a week,
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.880]   but I suspect their profits are doing just fine, thank you.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.560]   I mean, it's interesting that ties in a lot of the things
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.400]   we've been talking about.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.200]   I mean, Apple is different.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.040]   They don't have to compete with everybody
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:54.960]   in the entire world.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.240]   They just have to make products that are good enough margin
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.080]   to a loyal enough customer base
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.480]   that allows them to keep making new products.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.520]   It'd be interesting if we look forward five years from now,
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.200]   Apple's still doing very, very well.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.160]   Their market share is still not terribly impressive
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.360]   in their respective markets,
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.680]   but the fact is that the people buy things from Apple
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.360]   because they know they can't get products just like,
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.960]   they have a natural affection and affinity
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.680]   towards the way that Apple designs things
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.800]   and writes their software,
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.960]   and they know that no other manufacturer is doing it.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   So if they're not gonna win the hearts and minds battles
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.440]   with people who, the average person who buys phones,
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.560]   the average person who buys computers or TVs,
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.160]   it's okay for them to still be making billions of dollars
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.360]   in profits every year just on a 5% fan base.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   And that's perfectly, the whole point of playing this game
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.720]   is to get to come back to the ballpark next season.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.880]   And if they keep their batting average up,
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.160]   who cares how much money they actually,
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.440]   how many products they actually sell,
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.800]   what volume they actually make,
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.680]   and what percentage of the market they actually owned,
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.120]   as long as they keep coming to the ballpark
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:57.940]   year after year.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:58.780]   - Yeah.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.900]   - And I think that what's changed is that Apple
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:06.260]   got a taste of being a mass market manufacturer
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.880]   with the iPhone and the iPad,
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.920]   and there are certainly some who thought,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.680]   oh, this is fun, I like this.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.200]   I like, finally, I like being dominant.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.080]   I don't wanna be a put cheek anymore.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.240]   - We were right, we were right, we were right.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   - That was the collapse of Nokia and Blackberry.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.300]   And now Android will probably take the place of Symbian
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:23.720]   and Nokia and Apple will,
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.300]   remember when Steve Jobs first came up on stage
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.760]   and said, we just want one or two percent
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.220]   of the phone marketing will be happy.
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.460]   - Yeah, in the old days, that's all they wanted.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.260]   - Because Symbian and Nokia and all those companies
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.940]   were so huge and so dominant.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.380]   - Could be, yeah.
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.500]   - I'll make them all pay all high.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.420]   (laughing)
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.260]   - I'll finally move out of age.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.260]   - All will pay some Wilbur.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.700]   (laughing)
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.900]   - Well, maybe that's why Tim Cook's going to China.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.060]   We'll talk about Mr. Cook in China in just a little bit,
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.940]   but first, a word from squarespace.com.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.020]   If you're looking for somebody who hosts your website,
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.380]   I got a suggestion for you,
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:58.240]   the best website host in the world, squarespace.com.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.240]   One of the things that makes squarespace so good
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.380]   is the tight integration between the squarespace software,
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.300]   the content management system you'll be using,
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.020]   and the hosting software.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.920]   So they know that sometimes you talk about shared hosting,
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.240]   it's so much more sophisticated than that.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:17.300]   Your site may be spread out around a bunch of machines
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.600]   using a bunch of bandwidth.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.920]   They could turn on more bandwidth as necessary.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.720]   It's so tightly integrated that they have granular control
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.920]   over exactly what's happening.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.800]   And it's why, simply put,
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.600]   you cannot bring a squarespace site down.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.400]   They're always fast, always responsive.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.720]   And from your point of view, always gorgeous,
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.040]   easy to design, easy to use.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.800]   And of course, the best mobile experience.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.400]   If you're somebody who's looking for a website gallery,
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.420]   if you're a photographer or a designer,
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.440]   you've got to look at squarespace.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.640]   Not only does it look good,
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.520]   and will it reflect your aesthetic,
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.880]   a unique aesthetic by the way,
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.520]   'cause every squarespace site starts,
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.600]   you start with the same several dozen templates,
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   but then the customization makes it completely,
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.120]   your own site, makes it look exactly the way you want it to.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.320]   It's why so many artists, so many designers,
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.480]   so many photographers use squarespace,
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.880]   because they can make it reflect exactly their aesthetic.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.400]   And then, just kind of thrown in for free,
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.880]   you get the best mobile experience.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.200]   Your users are gonna love it,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.280]   because let's say your photographer,
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.960]   you're using Avenue as your template,
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.640]   and you want a great gallery.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.480]   The template looks great on all sizes.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:28.000]   Every time you, here, let me go to a live demo of this.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.520]   It's so, this is Avenue.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.640]   It's so great, because as you size the screen
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.400]   from 27 inches down to three and a half inches,
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.400]   the site automatically, it's called
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.480]   Mobile Responsive Design, responds to it.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.760]   Whenever you upload an image to your gallery, for instance,
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.160]   it creates seven different sized thumbnails.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.600]   And then it flows the text, it flows everything around,
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.280]   so that it looks the best on the screen.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:58.360]   And this, you get automatically, this is part of the deal.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.680]   I think you're gonna love squarespace.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.880]   That's why they've got a free template for you,
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.400]   a free trial offer, I should say for you.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.760]   If you go to squarespace.com,
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.120]   just click that yellow Get Started button,
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.160]   and you're already, in there, designing,
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.920]   you can import all your existing content,
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.640]   preserve all the SEO, all the images,
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.560]   all the links, they all go right over.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.400]   Play with it, you got it two weeks free.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.920]   Use all the help systems, the webinars, everything.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.200]   And if you decide you like it,
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.760]   you gotta look at the pricing on this,
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.480]   it's such a good deal.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.520]   They've simplified the pricing,
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.760]   there's only two plans now,
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.520]   the standard and the unlimited.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.040]   You get the best deal when you buy an annual plan.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:33.880]   Actually, I think you can even buy
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.640]   more than one year at a time.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.480]   But if you buy a year, it was worth
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.800]   the standard plan is $8 a month.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.920]   The unlimited plan, the top of the line,
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.080]   is only $16 a month.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.360]   For that, you get unlimited pages, galleries, blogs,
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.080]   unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage,
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.560]   unlimited contributors.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.000]   Whenever you buy an annual plan,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   they'll automatically register the domain name for you
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.040]   and hook it up so it works.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.760]   You get so many great features.

[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.760]   you can take 10% off that first purchase.

[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.480]   If you're a developer, by the way,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.120]   they've got a developer platform
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.640]   you're gonna love the last you to use.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:20.240]   HTML5 stuff like CSS3 and JavaScript.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.040]   And it's got a code editor with syntax coloring
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.400]   and all that stuff.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.720]   Squarespace.com, use our offer code,
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:30.960]   Mac break one if you decide to buy to save 10%.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   Mr. Cook goes to Beijing to meet with China Mobile.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:41.760]   Now that's the largest carrier in China.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.320]   And the iPhone has never been on China Mobile.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.240]   It's always been on smaller carriers.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.520]   So Tim Cook met with Xi Guo Hua,
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.360]   the chairman of China Mobile
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.720]   to discuss matters of cooperation,
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.600]   according to China Mobile.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.600]   In other words, I bet you you're gonna get an iPhone 5
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.200]   on China Mobile, which would be huge.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.480]   They're currently on China Unicorn, China Telecom.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.600]   So this is the part of Apple
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.120]   that still wants to be mass market.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.200]   They wanna dominate.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.400]   And right now I think the iPhone's popular,
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.680]   but not as popular as it could be
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.200]   if we're on all the carriers.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.040]   You would have to, if they get on China Mobile,
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.160]   they would have to redesign the iPhone
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.640]   because it uses an unusual 3G network technology.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:31.160]   And some experts say that Apple might be waiting
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.160]   for a new network technology
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.720]   so that they could put the iPhone on it.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.640]   - It's like Verizon all over again.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.840]   - Yeah, similar, isn't it?
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.640]   - Every time I hear these stories,
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.440]   I keep thinking, geez, what ever happened to those rumors
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.200]   about Apple making its own carrier?
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   - Yeah, well.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.120]   - Still be nice.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.840]   - It would be, I mean--
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:54.680]   - Turned out it was Google.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.480]   - This pipe dream of having FaceTime
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.360]   replace your telecom is wonderful,
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.400]   but I just don't think Apple's ready to do that.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.800]   - Well, there certainly are, there's like true phone,
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.000]   I guess, had some stuff at CES,
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.080]   and they buy all their service from regional providers
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.240]   and then aggregate it into a single account.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.640]   So this kind of thing is possible,
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.000]   but we just haven't seen Apple wanna do that.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.160]   - I think we're getting an idea of how difficult this is
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.520]   by watching Dish Network.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.520]   Charlie Ergin tried to cobble together a mobile network
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.480]   by buying Spectrum.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.560]   You know, he made that hostile bid last week for Clear Wire.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:28.960]   I don't think that's gonna happen.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.320]   - And that's just in one country.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.120]   - And that's just in one country.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.760]   And it's a very iffy thing,
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.960]   and Charlie's super smart and has lots of money.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.080]   Well, I don't know if he has lots of money,
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.800]   but he has enough money to be a player.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.160]   Let's put it that way.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.800]   Maybe he doesn't have $130 billion in the bank.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.480]   Maybe if he did, it would be a little bit easier.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.160]   But I just think it's hard.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.320]   I think that there's a, you know, Spectrum is the issue.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.220]   - Getting Spectrum, it is not an infinite resource.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:56.240]   - And pipes aren't a sexy business.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.200]   - Right.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.960]   I think Apple, admittedly Apple would prefer not
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.720]   to have to deal with carriers,
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.560]   but it's better than the alternative.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.640]   - And the S&C and all the regulations and other countries.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.480]   - Right.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.200]   I think it's just better than the alternative.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   If you wanna be in the phone business.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   Apple did publish a Chinese New Year gift guide.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.920]   Which is kind of interesting.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:22.240]   - A moon cake in the shape of an Apple TV.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.480]   - That's right.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:31.880]   It's aimed, I guess, at Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.040]   'cause it's in English.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:38.760]   But you know, I think the iPad mini did quite well.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.480]   Is it not in China?
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.280]   - Just launching the 3G versions of the iPad 4
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.160]   and iPad mini this Friday in China.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.040]   - Oh, so they're about to come out.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.000]   - Yeah.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.600]   - It's almost time to head home with the perfect gifts,
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.240]   reads the Apple Store tag line.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.440]   Find great gift ideas for everyone on your list
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.160]   in the Chinese New Year gift guide.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.080]   And then here it is.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.560]   And the mini is, yeah, this is in Hong Kong dollars.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.520]   - 2,588 Hong Kong dollars.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.040]   That sounds like a lot.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.800]   - You could fit a Nano in a red envelope, Leo.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.640]   I mean, it is workable.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.480]   - Oh, look at that.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.760]   They even have little mini smart cover
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.560]   that looks just like a red envelope,
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:18.000]   which is the traditional Chinese gift cash gift.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.880]   Comes in a red envelope.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.600]   You're right, you picked right up on that.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.680]   Here's another one.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.440]   Michael Kors' red ziplot wallet.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.560]   This is the modern Chinese New Year.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.440]   Look at this.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.640]   A lot of red in this.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.720]   Let's see, moving on here.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.240]   That's the China, that's the China corner, the China beat.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.880]   - We hope you enjoyed our references to mooncakes
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.480]   and red envelopes, just proving that we are a very cosmopolitan
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.320]   - Cosmopolitan.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.440]   - Cosmopolitan, that break weekly.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:51.960]   - Maybe because of this China stuff,
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.960]   the rumor flew that Apple would be developing
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.080]   cheaper iPhone models.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.960]   A rumor Phil Schiller was quick to debunk.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.480]   This came from, I think from Bloomberg,
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:08.160]   which said that Apple is weighing retail prices of $99
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.280]   to $149 for device that would debut in late 2013
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.520]   at the earliest, according to the person who has to be named,
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.120]   not named because of the negotiation blah, blah, blah.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.400]   Although this person said that Apple's been talking
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.040]   to at least one of the top US wireless carriers.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.520]   - Is that the part that makes no sense to me?
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.160]   I mean, in the US, we all know,
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.440]   I mean, you can get them for nothing.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.520]   It's like, how do you get cheaper than the 49 bucks?
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.360]   - Yeah.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.320]   - Free 49 bucks or 99 bucks.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.720]   And 99 bucks is arguably still one of the, the 4S is still
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.400]   arguably one of the best smartphones you can buy
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.320]   of any operating system.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.720]   - But that's subsidized by the cell carriers.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.120]   So it really the market for a cheaper cell phone is not us.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.200]   - It's emerging markets.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.800]   - Well, or the carriers.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.640]   - That's what I'm saying.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.520]   In the US, that doesn't make sense.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.040]   It might make sense if they were to do this internationally
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.320]   to say that we can do the ability to sell
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.840]   an unsubsidized phone in any market that they want
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.960]   without having to make those kinds of deals.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:09.240]   I mean, I think that the company that can manufacture
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.440]   really decent smartphones, they could simply sell flat out
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.360]   unsubsidized at an affordable rate
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.640]   where they can break the $200 barrier
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.160]   and simply tell people that this phone is just about as good
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.920]   as a top drawer Android.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.200]   It's just about as good as an iPhone.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.400]   It costs almost the same as an iPhone.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.640]   But the thing is, you never have to have a contract.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.800]   You can put any sim in it.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.720]   You can hop from carrier to carrier to carrier.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.120]   And here's how much money you will save
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.640]   over the cost of a two year contract
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.920]   by having this owning, this unlocked phone.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.840]   I think if a company can ever crack that,
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:42.960]   that's gonna really, really upset a lot of the industry.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.600]   - Actually, apparently a mistranslation
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.880]   of Phil Schiller's interview with the Shanghai Evening News
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.120]   implied that Apple would never make a cheap phone.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.560]   In fact, he did not say that.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.680]   The later translations say he indicated the company
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.000]   would make the best products
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.800]   and never blindly pursue market share.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.040]   That's kind of what we were just talking about.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.600]   We're not gonna chase market share.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.640]   We're not gonna go for the larger market.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.880]   We're just gonna make the best products.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:12.720]   - It's the net book thing.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.120]   Apple never makes cheap products.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.600]   They can make less expensive products.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.720]   And they've shown over and over again,
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.360]   whether it's the iPad or the iPad Mini or the iPod Mini
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.920]   or the iPod Shuffle that they're very good at
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.000]   either removing features or reducing size
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.600]   or making a compromise like screen resolution
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.800]   that lets them put out a high quality product
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.360]   that is less expensive than the full-blown version.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:35.040]   But these rumors about the cheap iPhone rumors,
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.680]   I remember reading them in 2007,
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.880]   July of 2007, right after the iPhone came out.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:43.000]   And I heard from very reliable sources going back
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.320]   to three years that Apple was working on
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:46.640]   a lower-cost version of the iPhone,
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.520]   but they decided instead to drop the price
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.760]   on previous versions,
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.440]   which made a lot of sense in a contract market.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.360]   So, I mean, this could be just like the television
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.960]   and just like everything else that we hear about
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.560]   it's a project in Apple's labs.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.360]   And when market conditions are good enough
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.720]   where they believe that emerging markets are something
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.840]   that they want to challenge Blackberry or Symbian
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:07.000]   or whomever or low-budget Android phones for it,
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.600]   they'll release the product.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:13.600]   - So, after reading all of the different reportage,
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:19.520]   it seems that it's unclear whether,
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.320]   the original quote was that Phil Schiller said quote,
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.600]   that cheaper phones would never be the future.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.920]   That's kind of been withdrawn.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.320]   And what he really said, John Gruber even says,
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:33.400]   doesn't mean Apple isn't going to produce a cheaper phone,
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.160]   which if you untangle the double negative means they could.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.080]   - Never putting video on an iPod.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.600]   - Yeah.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.120]   It was unusual that though I have to say,
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.160]   when an Apple executive like Phil Schiller
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.920]   makes remarks on the record,
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.560]   even if it's to a Chinese newspaper,
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.360]   that's unusual and it's something to pay attention to
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:52.640]   and parse carefully.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.640]   Because there's a reason why he's making public comment.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.480]   - True.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.200]   - They took that story down and put it back up so often.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.840]   - I know, that's why it's hard to know what it means.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.000]   - On the other hand, he's not making those comments
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.360]   to a grand jury, so he's free to say what it means.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   (laughing)
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.660]   - He's not on their oath.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.080]   We don't know the laws of China Andy,
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.080]   we don't know what applies.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:15.160]   It was quote an official interview,
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.480]   not an unofficial interview.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.040]   - Realness surviving based on the money
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.840]   they're making from emerging markets,
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.920]   S60 or whatever the last build of Symbian
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.520]   is surviving based on emerging markets.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.280]   There is definitely phone business in those countries.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.480]   - So you make this distinction between cheaper
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.800]   and less expensive, you've even wrote an article on it
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:35.800]   for imore.com.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.160]   What do you mean by,
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   what is the difference between cheaper and less expensive?
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.720]   - So again, I go back to Netflix.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.000]   You can take cheap products,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.840]   use cheap manufacturing techniques,
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.720]   cut a lot of corners and put out a very cheap product.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.000]   And that's what Tim Cook says when,
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.720]   you buy it and it seems cheap,
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.160]   but you take it home and it's a horrible experience.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.880]   And Apple didn't make a cheap version of the iPad.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.720]   They didn't use substandard technology.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.960]   You can argue about they didn't use a retina display,
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.520]   but the build quality on an iPad mini is fantastic
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.160]   and it's less expensive.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.320]   So Apple has gotten very good over the years,
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.120]   again, starting with the iPod mini and the iPod shuffle
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.560]   at putting together a higher quality product
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.760]   that they can still offer at a lower price.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.360]   And that's very different than just a cheap product
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.080]   that has, you know, squeaky plastic or the parts fall off of it,
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.760]   which has played other devices.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.040]   - Yeah, imagine the shock Apple ever released something
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.080]   that was like, cheesy.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:27.920]   - Right.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.960]   - Something like that. - Oh, back 4,400?
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.800]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.760]   - Yeah.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.480]   No, I mean, I've seen a,
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.320]   there's a Samsung convertible tablet that,
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.040]   and price-wise is excellent, feature-wise is excellent,
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.720]   but you just hold it in your hands and you're like,
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.800]   wow, I can just feel like the air inside this
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.000]   that is not being support.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.880]   I feel as though if I were to just do like this slightly,
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.960]   I would crack the entire thing and have.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.160]   But that said, however, I mean, you look at a device
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.800]   like the Nexus 7 tablet, there's nothing cheap about it.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   I mean, there is plastic on the back of it,
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.680]   but it's not as though it's flimsy.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.680]   It's not as though that it rattles around.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.160]   You could even say that it makes it easier to grip
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.200]   than slick metal.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.120]   And there is something that is like Google,
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.880]   which is different than being cheap.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.200]   - Consumers don't care.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.400]   Consumers say, wow, we don't know.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.240]   - We don't know. - We don't know.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.400]   - And it does everything that I wanna do
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.080]   for a small tablet.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.480]   Great, I'll take it.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.400]   - I think the lesson of netbooks was that you can't,
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.560]   in the long run, make something that crappy.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.560]   People know.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.160]   - Well, no, the lesson of netbooks is that
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.000]   existing notebooks were not serving the modern needs
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.240]   of consumers.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.000]   That what I think what really blew people's minds
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.920]   about netbooks was the idea where,
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   wait a minute, this has a really cheap mobile processor.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.240]   It's very, very slow.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.120]   It has a smaller keyboard that's not nearly as handy to use,
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.080]   but for some reason, people are okay with that.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.000]   So I think that really was like the signal fire
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.040]   that told a lot of designers and manufacturers that
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.600]   if we, it's okay to delete a lot of features
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.800]   off of a device to make a really compelling $500, $400,
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.760]   or even $300 computer, because these days,
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.760]   people are not necessarily gonna be taking this
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.960]   mobile device out to do five hours of spreadsheet work.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.440]   They're taking it out to just keep up on Facebook
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.320]   and watch videos and stuff like that.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.520]   So that was just the first expression of a product
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.800]   that eventually became the modern tablet.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.120]   So even that product was useful.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.960]   - I do agree that consumers don't care
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.640]   if a company is subsidizing their product,
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.040]   but John Fingers, what a really good article on this
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.760]   for Engadget, that for example, the Amazon Kindle
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.600]   is subsidized by Amazon, but only in markets
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.280]   where they can make up that money on content.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.120]   So it's not available in a lot of countries.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.440]   The Nexus 4 is subsidized by Google in some countries,
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.240]   but it's hugely expensive in other countries.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.680]   And traditionally companies that, I don't wanna say dumping,
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.320]   but that's one term that's applied to it,
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.920]   don't survive over the long point.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.760]   And those companies, the people who dumped VHS tapes
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.920]   decades ago, or people, sorry, VHS players,
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.640]   were companies who dumped other products up until recently,
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.240]   aren't in long-term markets.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.960]   And Apple has always maintained margin
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.680]   and maintained their business over decades.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.760]   And I think that's the kind of plan they'll continue.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.240]   I don't see them operating in a manufacturer
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.880]   or subsidized market.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.280]   - Well, I mean, Amazon, the last time I saw
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.560]   a manufacturing breakdown on a modern color Kindle tablet,
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.920]   they're making a very acceptable profit
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.360]   on each copy that they actually sell.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.080]   And that doesn't even factor in how much money
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.480]   they're making off of the content of it.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.680]   Every device that's sold is gonna have,
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.680]   whether it's made by Apple or not,
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.440]   it's gonna have a shelf life of about two or three years.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.320]   So you underscore the most important thing,
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.160]   I think there was to know about Apple,
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.200]   which is that so long as they can sustain
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.560]   those heavy markups on every product that they make,
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.520]   they have an immense number of freedom
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.680]   to do exactly what they wanna do.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.480]   And one of the Apple strengths has always been
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.880]   that what they want to do, and this sounds naive,
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.720]   but I'll say it, they want to make great products.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.720]   They never wanna make a single product
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.320]   that they'd be ashamed to give as a gift to a loved one.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.920]   And that really comes through in every single,
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.320]   practically everything's single thing they do
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.840]   in every single thing that they actually ship.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.480]   - That's something Steve Jobs beat into them.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.360]   I think that they did make some crappy products
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.280]   and they're the Gilda Mio-Yo era.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.520]   - Yeah, that just fills it.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.480]   Hey, we have this gap in our product line.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.280]   It feels as though we should be making
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.120]   an all in one that has these features,
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.280]   so we're gonna make this feature.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.680]   It feels as though we should be selling computers
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.040]   through big box retailers.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.800]   We'll make a special model that we can sell
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.120]   through a big box retailer.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.160]   Rest now, they're saying that is a good idea,
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.640]   but we can't make a computer.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.840]   We would be happy with that way,
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.880]   so we're not gonna do it.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:40.720]   - Exactly.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.680]   - So I think the fact that, I'm sorry,
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.680]   I will wind this up.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.400]   The fact that Apple can be so successful
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.480]   selling high markup and high, really expensive
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.200]   compared to other comparable models
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.240]   doesn't mean that every other company has to do that.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:59.400]   There are ways to make a decent profit on smaller margins.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.280]   - To get back to something Renee was talking about earlier,
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.360]   though, is that Apple has been doing
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.360]   awfully well in hardware.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.160]   I won't anyway, Chris says they're hardware,
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.400]   but I really think the software quality has been flopping.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.600]   That Iowa 6 has significant bugs.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.440]   Mountain Lion has issues.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.200]   They're releasing, they do an update, and it kills stuff.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.000]   I mean, security updates, we're breaking MacBooks.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.880]   I mean, this is the kind of thing
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.480]   which it just says that they're not testing,
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.320]   if anything else.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.640]   - Is it the Scott Forestall problem?
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.040]   Is it gonna be better now that he's gone?
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.320]   - I don't know, but it's been bad for a couple years now.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.840]   And I have not seen that commitment
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.480]   to just saying, this is gonna work,
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.120]   and it's gonna work right.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.560]   - You know, I think we have some rosy glasses.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.600]   - You know, a friend of mine who's an iOS developer,
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.080]   I said, friend of mine who's an iOS developer says
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.560]   that he has reported more bugs with iOS 6
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.760]   than all of the previous versions of iOS combined.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.840]   You know, and they've come back, Mark, is duplicate.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.680]   So they're real.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.400]   I mean, he's not making this stuff up.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.600]   - Are Rene, are you about to say
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.840]   that this is always been this way?
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.560]   - No, yeah, I think history kind of blurs things a little bit,
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.000]   but every time a new version of iOS comes out
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.120]   or Mountain Line comes out,
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.840]   we get flooded with people who have problems.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.920]   I mean, the point O version of every version of iOS
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.920]   has been hugely problematic.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.920]   And now it's compounded with things like iCloud,
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.440]   which you talk to any developer,
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.920]   the, you know, maybe key value store works great,
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.680]   but document store is a nightmare.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.840]   And there's just so many things happening in iOS now
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.640]   that it sort of magnifies the problem.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.440]   And if that's a Scott Forestall issue or not,
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.440]   we'll see you when Craig Federico, you're running everything.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.000]   But iOS 6 was very much Apple's placeholder.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.600]   They got Google off their operating system.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.800]   They sent out social to Twitter and Facebook
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.160]   and they set up a lot of stuff.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.440]   And I think now is the year we have to watch them deliver
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.200]   on that foundation.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.080]   - But they broke a lot of existing stuff.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.160]   I mean, that's, I mean, audio is broken in iOS 6.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.160]   You know, that-
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.520]   - Maybe it's a measure of how many lines of code there are.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.600]   As you said, this stuff is much more complex than it used to be.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.800]   It's hard to make it as reliable.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.320]   - Although audio breaks every beta,
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.360]   every beta will break audio.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.200]   I forget things.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.360]   No, there's a specific reason for that in core audio,
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.840]   but every time you get a beta,
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.520]   things like the podcast app and the iTunes app,
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.480]   stop working for any normal human,
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.600]   because why you shouldn't install them.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600]   And usually they fix it,
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.560]   but there's always little issues that follow the new release.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.000]   And now they're doing less releases.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.560]   In previous years, we'd have a 1.1, a 0.2, a 0.3,
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:30.000]   and we're still on iOS 6.0.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.840]   - But I guess-
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.920]   - Just to reiterate though,
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.000]   this is not the kind of thing we see happening
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.400]   in the hardware world.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.040]   In the hardware world, Apple is taking the time
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.080]   to get it right, to get those,
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.320]   those millimeter measurements,
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.120]   as small as they possibly can.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.560]   That doesn't come easy either.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.920]   And yet they're doing not.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.960]   They're just not doing it on the software side.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.040]   - They are a hardware company.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.600]   - Yeah, but they don't make a hardware company
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.280]   if their software works.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.600]   - Yeah, I agree with the Adam.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.520]   - I mean, there are a short number of things
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.880]   that are absolutely, historically,
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.360]   but an absolute Apple signature features.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.720]   And one of them is always,
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.840]   I'm sure you can almost say this with me, it just works.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.680]   And I think that in 2012, they lost that.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:13.520]   - It doesn't work.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.560]   - I don't know if they lost that completely,
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.320]   but there's no longer for me,
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:23.200]   that sort of assumption that if I go with iOS,
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.640]   if I go with Mac OS,
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.320]   this thing is gonna function stable
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.320]   and securely for the foreseeable future.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.680]   I just don't trust it to work that way.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:37.760]   And as to Renee's point, absolutely true again,
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.040]   anytime you go to a point over release,
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.360]   you gotta, that's the dust count on the horizon.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.360]   That's when you know that the person that,
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.000]   the person that the sheriff put into jail five years ago,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.600]   just escaped and he's headed back to dry gulps
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.840]   for retribution,
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.040]   you know that bad things are gonna be happening.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.920]   But the difficulty is that they've made
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.760]   so many changes to so many basic things
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.800]   that if iCloud is screwed up
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.600]   and iCloud is the only easy way to move documents
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.280]   between yourself and your devices,
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.000]   that's a big issue.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.720]   And that's something that really affects everything.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.720]   And it's not enough to make someone abandon what they're,
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.760]   abandon what they're familiar with and what they like,
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.760]   but it is enough so that if they are at end of contract
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.400]   and now they're kinda looking around where they say,
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.000]   wow, you mean this Windows phone, show me SkyDrive again.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.920]   Wow, you mean it's that easy to,
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.680]   I mean, the people I share the stock with
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.200]   can actually edit it on a webpage.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.200]   They don't even necessarily,
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.480]   wow, that's interesting.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:33.800]   And whether that's a legitimate thing that they're doing
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.880]   or just simply reacting to a good demo,
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.440]   that doesn't change the fact that now they're locked
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.920]   into a different phone for two years
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.640]   instead of being locked into an iPhone.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.680]   It's an interesting new variable, I think, that's all.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.200]   - Speaking of things that just don't work,
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.720]   you probably saw the Department of Homeland Security
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.840]   told users to disable Java support in their browsers
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.840]   because Java 7 has such a massive security vulnerability
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.320]   and it is already being exploited in the wild.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.320]   Safari does, unlike Internet Explorer,
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.200]   where there's really actually no way to disable
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.000]   Java support, at least not fully.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.760]   Safari does have a simple checkbox that just says,
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.080]   you know, don't use, it's in the security,
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.760]   it says, you know, web content enable Java,
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.280]   just uncheck that and you're protected
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.720]   because that's the issue is Java loading on web pages.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.400]   However, Apple has done something interesting.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.880]   I guess they did this in an update.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.120]   They updated the XProtect's P-LEST backlist
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.400]   to require for Java to work on Macs
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.800]   and as yet unreleased version of Java 7.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:48.720]   Presumably the patch that Oracle or Apple plan to push.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.680]   So if you try to use Java 7 on OS 10,
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.440]   it's gonna fail the check in the anti-malware system
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.720]   and it's just not gonna run.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   That's the Java 7 plugin.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.800]   So I presume that Apple, I was just checking update
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.680]   to see if Apple has pushed out,
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.440]   has yet pushed out an update for,
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.960]   it doesn't look like they have for OS 10,
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.200]   but the best bet, really,
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.560]   'cause most websites don't use Java,
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.200]   the best bet is just to disable Java in Safari and move on.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.840]   It's not that easy in Chrome either.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.640]   You have to do Chrome colon slash slash plugins
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.040]   and look for Java plugins.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.400]   Although to Google and Apple's everlasting credit,
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:37.400]   when you do run Java in Safari or Chrome,
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.000]   anytime you run it, regardless of what your settings are,
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.040]   it will warn you and say, you're about to run Java,
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.080]   are you sure?
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.440]   You really wanna do that?
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.960]   So you still have one last chance to say no.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.000]   - Yeah.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   - I have not, I should try.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.560]   I don't understand if this was an update,
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.240]   it must have been an update to OS 10 that I didn't see.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.000]   - Unless there was a kill switch.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.080]   - Yeah, basically it's a kill switch, it says that.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.760]   You can't run it until you get the update.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.520]   - T-Mobile will soon sell iPhones,
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.800]   according to the CEO at CES.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.440]   No surprise there.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.280]   They've wanted to do that for a while.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.280]   - I saw T-Mobile 3G at CES.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.880]   I haven't seen that outside of Moscone Center before.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.200]   - On an HSPA+ right?
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.040]   Not an L2.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.640]   - On an iPhone, they were doing it on the PC.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.480]   - Oh, on an iPhone?
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.320]   - Yeah, on a PC.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.160]   - A little box out front or something.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.000]   - A bubble.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:31.840]   - Bubble.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.960]   And something we talked about on,
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.760]   Twitter, yes, Sunday, and we will be talking about
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.120]   on Thursday on a special.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:45.600]   Personal audio LLC is suing podcasters in East Texas.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.440]   They sued Apple last year.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.280]   I did not know this.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:53.280]   In 2011, they sued and won a patent infringement lawsuit
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.720]   against Apple and won an $8 million judgment.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.040]   The jury found Apple infringed two patents
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:03.400]   related to downloadable playlists with iOS devices.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.200]   One covering an audio program player,
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.080]   including a dynamic program selection controller,
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.520]   the other covering audio program distribution
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.880]   and playback system.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.000]   They're now going after content creators directly.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.960]   They've sued Adam Corolla's Ace Broadcasting
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.680]   and the How Stuff Works podcast,
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.560]   saying they have violated a patent for a system
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.600]   for disseminating media content,
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:29.920]   representing episodes in a serialized sequence.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.720]   You laugh, I'm crying.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.520]   - Dickens, wait, it was Dickens, wasn't it?
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.360]   - I'm just waiting, yeah, Dickens invented that.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.560]   I'm just waiting for the summons to arrive
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.520]   at our front desk.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.760]   - A lot says letter.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.560]   - Yeah, this is crazy.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.400]   So we're gonna talk to Adam.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:51.440]   We'll do a special simulcast between Adam Corolla's podcast,
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.200]   seven o'clock in the evening,
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.160]   Pacific time Thursday evening,
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.240]   10 p.m. - It's like the formation
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.560]   of the Avengers, it's wonderful.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.520]   - Well, you know, to Adam's credit,
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.440]   normally when you get sued, you say,
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.080]   "My lawyers say we're not gonna talk about this."
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.960]   But I think it's really important
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.800]   that we all talk about it as risky as it is
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.000]   and to come up with a strategy to try to save podcasting.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.520]   These guys already won against Apple.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.840]   - Do you know what they're suing over, Leo?
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.520]   Like, is it over at the app that distributes it,
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.800]   over the creation of the RSS feed, over the--
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.080]   - It sounds like it's the creation of the RSS feed.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.720]   I haven't seen the lawsuit.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:32.480]   And maybe Adam will have a better idea.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:35.760]   I can read you the patent that they claim.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.080]   - That's a dramatic reading, Leo?
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.160]   - Would you like a dramatic reading?
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.560]   - Ladies and gentlemen, a system
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.880]   for disseminating media content,
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:48.280]   representing episodes in a serialized sequence.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.120]   You can't item not a lawyer, and you know,
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.320]   if I read these things, they don't make any sense to me.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.080]   I don't even know why you could patent something like this.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.240]   They filed for this patent.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.740]   I might point out in 2009 and were awarded it last year,
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:05.320]   an audio program and message distribution system
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.040]   in which a host system organizes and transmit program
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.640]   segments to client subscriber locations.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.320]   By the way, we do not do that.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.560]   iTunes might do that.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.360]   The host organizes the program segments by subject matter
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.240]   and creates scheduled programming in accordance
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.560]   with preferences associated with each subscriber.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.040]   We do not do that.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.880]   Program segments are associated with descriptive subject matter
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.320]   segments and the subject matter segments
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.840]   may be used to generate both text and audio.
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.240]   This doesn't sound like it's related at all,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.600]   but this is what they're suing over.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.160]   - Probably assuming that everyone will just settle
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.520]   because it's cheaper for them than litigating--
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.360]   - Precise thousand bucks from everybody.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.360]   - Precisely.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.120]   And the fact that they have an $8 million,
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.040]   they've also, they say they have licenses
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.760]   from many, many other companies, including Blackberry,
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.060]   including XM or Sirius, I guess.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:58.160]   So, I don't know, we'll have a much more detailed conversation
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.720]   if I could try to get some lawyers on with us
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.880]   on Thursday night and talk about it.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.880]   I just think the podcast and community needs to say,
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.880]   hey, wait a minute, hold on there.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.160]   - Slow down.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.160]   - Has there ever been like a summit between like guys like you
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.640]   and Adam Corroa and Chris Hardwick,
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.800]   but people who like head broadcasting network
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.520]   to talk about these sort of issues?
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.520]   - No, but I think it's a show,
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.160]   or even just like, let's get together for dinner,
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:23.040]   get a private dinner room and just talk about where we're going.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.360]   - No, not to my knowledge unless they have one--
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.240]   - It sounds like it'd be an interesting dinner.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.240]   - Yeah.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.920]   I think probably we should do one in public
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.480]   and then one in private, in which we could divide
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.040]   the known world.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:34.880]   (laughing)
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.200]   - In a volcano headquarters.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.920]   - You know, the room that they film,
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:42.160]   like the meaning of the five family scenes,
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.880]   five family scenes with Godfather,
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.400]   I believe that is actually a building that is still exists
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.600]   and you can actually use that room.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.600]   - Oh, that would be cool.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.760]   - Just put a ditch of walnuts in front of everybody.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.600]   That's all.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:58.160]   - Yeah, I mean, yeah, the good news about what we do
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.000]   is we're in such the infancy that we are not in any way
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.280]   really competing with each other.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.840]   So as this is now is the time to decide who gets drugs,
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.080]   who gets numbers, who gets prostitution.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.880]   (laughing)
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:14.320]   - What Jason had this week at Radio Castle,
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.760]   I forgot all vengeance because this is the business
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.080]   we have chosen.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:18.920]   - Exactly.
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.880]   - If Matt Brick Weekly should lose its bandwidth,
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:26.080]   I'll be struck by a bolt of lightning that I will know.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.320]   (laughing)
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.000]   - And if Adam Curl is there,
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.080]   he'd be liberally profusely salted with profanity.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.000]   (laughing)
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.960]   No, it's funny, we all get along.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.040]   I'll tell you the closest to that,
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:44.400]   which I was at a week ago is the New Media Expo.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.280]   And that was a great event with a lot of podcasters
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.520]   there, not the big names.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.720]   So I think Chris Hardwood came later.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.920]   Adam and Chris were in town for CES.
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.280]   I don't think they came to podcast Expo or add New Media Expo.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.880]   But I don't know.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.320]   I think maybe now is a good time to start doing it.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.280]   - You are the Beatles of podcasting.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.200]   - Exactly.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.920]   - John Paul, George and Lee.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.600]   - Exactly, I don't even mean that as a joke.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.440]   - I do.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.280]   (laughing)
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.200]   - It would be an interesting experiment.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.040]   - Yeah.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.880]   - It's nothing else.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.960]   - Yeah, interesting.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.760]   And I'll just have an intern start my car
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.840]   for the next few months.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.680]   (laughing)
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.080]   - It's a suggestion beat master.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.240]   - Not okay, not only that,
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.320]   but you could also start a charity taunting
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.560]   where each of you puts the names of your favorite charity
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.200]   and puts $5,000 in the pot.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.800]   Given like the personalities
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.320]   and what you guys do for a living.
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.160]   - Yeah.
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.160]   - And the last person to,
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.400]   and that there's,
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:38.120]   you'll have the private meeting and the public meeting
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.840]   and the last person to ever mention something
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.000]   that happens in the private meeting
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.840]   gets the entire pot for his charity.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.680]   (laughing)
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.680]   'Cause at some point,
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.640]   all of you are podcasting 20 hours a day
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.120]   or say, well, and then,
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.040]   Lee on the point, he showed me the sprint.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.040]   Oh, damn it.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.800]   I mentioned the one he showed me.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.600]   Sorry, Leo, okay, I lose the $5,000.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.520]   - I would lose that one for sure, right away.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.000]   One more story that we're gonna take a break
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   and get to our tips and products of the week.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.360]   I know you all have some.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.040]   But if you were you watching this morning
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:11.800]   when Facebook announced it's a social search feature,
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.240]   any thoughts about that any of you?
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.760]   Renee, did you watch it?
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.080]   - I did, I was lured there
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.120]   by the often present rumors of a Facebook phone and then--
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.480]   - Oh, it's such a mess.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.560]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.000]   - I actually got to watch it with the folks from Tech News today
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.120]   that were kind enough to have me on.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.640]   So we got to watch it as it happened.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.840]   And I mean, social graph search is interesting.
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.840]   It's natural language, interface is interesting.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.680]   I just am hoping that all that stuff gets
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.480]   rocked up into an API so that my iPhone and Siri
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.360]   can search with it in iOS 7.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.920]   - Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.880]   - But I think it's also like, it's a way for Facebook
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.600]   to try to convince us to give it more data,
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.280]   which is actually, like Facebook's business
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.760]   is not making search for us.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.520]   It's getting our data from us
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.320]   and they surface search as a way to get it.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.640]   So none of my family, none of my close friends,
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.760]   none of my real acquaintances use Facebook.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.200]   So it'll have limited appeal to me,
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.960]   but I can see pressure mounting to say,
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.160]   you know, what are, Rene, I can't find your restaurants.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.160]   Why aren't your restaurants in Facebook?
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.000]   - That's exactly what they were.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.280]   - I don't wanna tell you, ask me personally.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:07.960]   - No, it's too much trouble.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.480]   - I don't wanna talk to you, I just wanna know what your data is.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.800]   - The simple fact of the matter is,
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.320]   is that I think you have to actually care
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:18.200]   what large numbers of other random people think.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.320]   And I mean, I would never search for something on Facebook.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.160]   - Well, that's different.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.360]   Like it's not a large number of random people.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.600]   A large number of people that you care about.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.760]   I was in my meeting with me.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.040]   - Facebook, they're random.
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.040]   They're not friends. - But this is Facebook
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.320]   we're talking.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.560]   - I mean, I see the kind of--
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.480]   - They're full and full of friends.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.040]   - I see the kind of point that they're kind of making.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.600]   Yesterday I was in New York City,
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.440]   unexpectedly people from like Europe,
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:43.800]   that I was meeting with asked me,
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.040]   hey, let's go to lunch, you're American,
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:48.320]   you must know a great restaurant in New York City.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.840]   And I know a few, but it's like, I wish that,
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.320]   if there were a way that collectively,
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.280]   all the people I know who live in New York City
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.960]   could be pulled and asked, I'm at 57th and Broadway,
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.280]   what's a good restaurant within,
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.520]   let's say a five-block radius
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.800]   and get that sort of answer, that'd be valuable.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.640]   But what was disappointing about that entire announcement,
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.240]   to which, by the way, Facebook teased a week in advance
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.760]   with a big like media event sort of a push,
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.680]   is that if you're not,
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.360]   if you don't give a damn about Facebook already,
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.840]   this is of absolutely no use to you.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.600]   It's not gonna make somebody want to make Facebook
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.560]   a bigger part of their lives.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:30.480]   And if any, and it seems as though the push
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.440]   is towards integration as opposed to making sure
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.000]   that you're spending most of your time
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.480]   inside one social network.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.480]   If they were saying that we have made
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:41.200]   forced in alliance with pretty much every social network
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:46.200]   that's out there, that on an explicit opt-in basis,
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.120]   if your friend is more of a Twitter person
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.640]   or mobile Google Plus person,
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.400]   they can integrate with you personally
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.080]   can have access to their search results
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.960]   so that you will get that sort of invaluable
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.440]   personal recommendations of personal information.
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:02.240]   As is, it's like, I'm not gonna switch my Facebook habits,
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.800]   which now is, I will dip in there once a week
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.520]   just to see what my nieces and nephews in college
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.080]   are up to, that's what I do with Facebook right now.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.920]   I really don't post anything to it.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.120]   I'm not gonna start investing in Facebook
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.280]   just because I want to find out
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.080]   what a restaurant is like in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.760]   on the off-chance zone has actually been there.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:22.680]   It's just not a good value proposition for me.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.600]   - I think there's a tie into Bing as well,
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.320]   which means that if you used Bing,
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:29.400]   which I don't know anybody who does,
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.640]   but if somebody used Bing,
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.120]   then you get some social signals.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.960]   - Well, any search that Facebook's not doing now
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.040]   will offset to Bing,
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.680]   so you'll get a Bing result instead of a Facebook.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.800]   - Oh, it's in that direction, not the other direction.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.600]   - So it'd be better if we're in the other direction.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.440]   Like I search Bing and then I get,
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.520]   it's massaged by social results.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.120]   'Cause it is all about get you inside Facebook
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.480]   and make sure that you don't have to,
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.160]   the Facebook is the great casino of social media.
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.200]   The idea is to make sure that they can feed you
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.400]   and they give you restaurants inside Facebook,
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.040]   they give you pen and teller inside Facebook,
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.720]   they give you a song inside Facebook, exactly.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.240]   So that you always, always, always are within reach
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.080]   of the slot machines,
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.040]   which is the social media information.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.040]   They do not want you ever to set foot
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.480]   outside Facebook until you've got no more money left
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.200]   and they've got the titles to your car in your house.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.520]   - All right, let's take a break.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.240]   Anionako from the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.040]   Renee Richie from iMour.com,
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.160]   from tidbits.com, Adam Anxtur, all here
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.240]   and we're gonna get there.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.800]   Pics of the week in just a moment,
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.680]   but first I have a pick for you,
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:40.720]   a way to back up your data, Mac or PC
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.800]   for less than five bucks a month per computer
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:47.280]   for everything, automatic, continuous, offsite backup.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.160]   It's everything you need in backup.
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.760]   It's carbonite.com.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.680]   Because carbonite allows you not only
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:56.040]   to automatically encrypts during transmission,
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.640]   but allows you to further encrypt your data
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.320]   when it's there, it's complete trust, no one protection.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.440]   So if privacy is an issue, carbonite is a great choice.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.680]   A lot of other services do not offer
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.560]   that kind of trust, no one encryption.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.200]   It's also cloud storage, which is nice
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.920]   and they don't really doubt this,
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.000]   but what's nice is it's you can see your data anytime.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.040]   You don't have to wait for a disaster to strike.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.200]   Just log onto your carbonite account on any computer
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.000]   or use their iPhone or iPad app.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.120]   And there's your stuff, you can download it and use it.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.280]   So you've got the benefit of cloud storage,
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.120]   plus a backup you can trust,
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.680]   automatic and continuous means it's always up to date.
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:34.680]   It's a great way to make sure that you can sleep tonight.
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:35.920]   Try it free for two weeks.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.200]   You don't need a credit card, just our offer code,
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.920]   Mac break if you decide to buy,
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.760]   $59 a year and if you've used the offer code Mac break,
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.240]   you'll get 14 months for that price
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.440]   and additional two months free,
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.680]   automatic, continuous backup offsite.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.640]   So it's safe even if the worst happens,
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.760]   that's carbonite, carbonite.com.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.800]   The offer code is Mac break, give it a try today.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.640]   Our picks of the week will kick off with you Andy and not go.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.080]   Mine is something that's somewhat old news,
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.760]   but suddenly new news to people in 22 cities
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:14.240]   it's area streaming TV service.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.120]   Ooh, one of the best announcements from CES last week
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.400]   was that this service is gonna be expanding
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.560]   into 22 new cities.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.280]   What it is, and hopefully you can see it,
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.760]   and there we go behind me,
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.960]   is that it's a streaming service
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.880]   where that gives you all the broadcast TV channels
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:38.000]   inside your metro area available for DVR recording,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.360]   available for streaming and playable through
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.360]   almost any desktop browser and through iOS Safari browsers.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:51.200]   And I just love this because it is so deviously cunning
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.680]   and here it is, we're streaming right now
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.320]   the PBS station.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.240]   So it's in Boston?
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.440]   It's, well, no, this is an only in New York right now.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:04.080]   This is actually a demo account that they gave me
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.520]   for testing purposes.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.760]   It is, let me explain that if you haven't heard about this
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:13.120]   before, the deviousness, the cunning of this idea.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.000]   What it is is they ordinarily they'd have to license
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.440]   the feed from NBC to a deal with CBS,
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.720]   to a deal with Fox.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.720]   What they did was instead, I'm gonna pause
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:22.800]   so that you can actually hear me,
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.840]   what they did instead was they said,
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.000]   well, what if we have a different antenna
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.480]   for every subscriber that we have?
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.600]   We just put up an antenna that we simply lease
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.440]   to each one of our subscribers in that city.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.760]   And they come up with this technology
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.000]   where for every subscriber,
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.040]   there's a little antenna the size of a dime
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.200]   set up someplace.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:44.720]   So that, oh, no, no, we're not,
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.280]   we are not recording any of this.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.360]   We're not rebroadcasting.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.800]   We're just simply letting people use the antenna
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.000]   that this user actually owns and uses.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.760]   Yeah, you're running an antenna.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.440]   Exactly, so they open.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.640]   Exactly, so they, and you can record,
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.480]   you can do all the sort of stuff.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.960]   And so they opened it up in New York City last year,
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.640]   basically to see if they would get sued into oblivion.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.040]   But they actually, and so they did get sued.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.120]   They did get sued.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.200]   They won most, excuse me,
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.360]   that they were successful enough
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.760]   that they were able to now expand.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.800]   They got 30 million bucks in funding.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.440]   And now this is gonna be like a school
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.160]   and a snow announcement.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.440]   Wait until your city has been announced.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.880]   It's not gonna be available soon
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:24.720]   in the next couple of months.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.840]   In these following cities,
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.600]   Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham, Alabama,
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.040]   Boston, Gopats, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver,
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.320]   Detroit, Houston, Kansas City.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.360]   I don't know whether at which point,
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.480]   whether they're next to each other.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.840]   Madison, Wisconsin, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia,
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.920]   Pittsburgh, Providence, Rhode Island, Raleigh, Durham,
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.440]   North Carolina, Salt Lake City, Tampa, Florida,
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.080]   and Washington, D.C.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.200]   Nowhere on the West, I might add.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.120]   Nowhere on the West.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.840]   They don't wanna go anywhere near Hollywood.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:54.680]   You've done this one.
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.200]   Exactly, you don't want them to hear who you are.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:01.640]   And so, and the pricing is really, really great.
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.680]   You can get this access to this for one day for a dollar.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.200]   So if you're, and I should mention that
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:12.680]   this only is available to you if you live in that city.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.600]   And it's not as though,
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.480]   so it's not as though you can like be living someplace
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.080]   and get like local sports games.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.560]   But it's a dollar a day for a day pass.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.360]   We just want it for one day.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.920]   If you, for a month as eight bucks for a year,
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.760]   it's $80 and that includes 40 hours worth of DVR.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.760]   So really, really great stuff.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.640]   This really has brought me many steps closer
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.600]   to wanting to cut cable because that was one of the,
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.240]   one of the missing pieces because ever since
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.320]   the change over to digital broadcasting,
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:45.720]   I lost and I'll get five broadcast networks.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.960]   I get maybe three of them and I don't get CBS.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.520]   And since I like to watch Letterman,
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.720]   that's a big minus for me.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:56.720]   But I really recommend you go to ario.com, A-E-R-E-O.com
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.480]   if you're in any of those cities.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.120]   They're not going to be getting started
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:00.920]   for another couple of months,
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.360]   but if you pre-sign up,
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:03.640]   you'll be one of the first who was eight,
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:06.160]   who were able to sign up for an account there.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:08.560]   And it works just brilliantly great.
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.520]   And the price is pretty much just right there too.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.000]   - It's really great for the iPad.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.040]   One of our viewers was visiting us.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:15.880]   - Yeah.
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.800]   - You know who she is.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.280]   And she brought her ario and her iPad,
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.120]   a count on her iPad.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.000]   So we were able to watch it here
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.320]   because it's over the internet.
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.840]   And it really is kind of neat
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.080]   to be able to watch local TV.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.760]   It does solve that last mile problem
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.240]   that cord cutters have to survive.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.080]   - It's lovely.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.520]   And what you're seeing,
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.880]   the video that you're seeing behind me
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:36.040]   is actually being streamed off my LTE iPad.
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:41.040]   So that's what you get just HD, just off of LTE.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:44.720]   And well, they just do a whole bunch of things
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.840]   that were very correct about this.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.680]   One of them is that you can manually select
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.680]   what quality video you want to stream.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.960]   So if you are like on a 3G network
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.360]   or if you're on really dodgy,
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.040]   like hotel Wi-Fi or something,
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.280]   you can simply say,
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:58.040]   I know what David Letterman looks like
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.120]   at this point in my life.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:00.760]   You can just give me the lowest quality
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.240]   just to maximize the limited bandwidth that I have.
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.240]   - I have to point out, this is an interim solution
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.080]   that someday the cable companies
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:12.200]   and the television networks will become more enlightened
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.720]   and make this all work over the internet
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:15.640]   without the use of these ClueG little 10,
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:17.120]   you know, 10-cent and 10s.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.640]   But until then, I think--
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.000]   - Oh, the Meteor hits the dinosaurs.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.560]   - This is Barry Diller's company, by the way.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560]   And I think Barry is old and he says,
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.200]   you know, I know it's only gonna be 10 years
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.120]   before this, there's completely useless.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:28.520]   I'll make some money now.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.240]   I'll worry about that later.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.560]   I think it's great.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.880]   I really like the idea.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.720]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.040]   - I have two half picks.
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.160]   I wanted to first make sure I echoed Sarah's pick
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.680]   from last week, which is hundreds,
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.600]   a new game for the iPhone and iPad.
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.440]   - Oh, I have a play.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.120]   - Made by Adam Salzman, who did Cannibalt
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.640]   along with some of his partners.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:50.440]   And I used that on the plane in the hotel everywhere
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.200]   over CES to keep me whenever there was some downtime
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.840]   just to relax and it's a fantastic fun game.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.600]   - Is it better than Simpsons tapped out?
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:30:59.440]   - It's different.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.440]   It's--
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.280]   (laughing)
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.120]   - I can't stop.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:02.960]   - It's more of a brain teaser made game.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.400]   - I can't stop playing this.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.880]   Help me somebody, please.
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:08.240]   (laughing)
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.280]   - I built a real-style screen field.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.520]   (laughing)
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:17.520]   - The other one is doing what I do is very strange
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.880]   because I travel for half the year
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.480]   and then I'm pretty much home for half the year.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:23.400]   So starting with CES, there's Macworld, GDC,
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.320]   WWDC, other shows.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:28.040]   So every January like clockwork, I install TripIt
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.680]   and I just email everything that I get to TripIt.
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.440]   I have the paid app, the pro account
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.280]   and it takes care of everything
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.800]   because come January, I've forgotten
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.040]   how to run my travel life.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.040]   I lose track of everything.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.720]   And TripIt just, it pops up alerts.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.720]   It tells me about gate changes would happen all the time.
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:46.600]   Travel changes when planes or runways are iced down
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:48.920]   and it means that I don't have to worry about that anymore
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:52.040]   and that's the best kind of technology for me.
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:55.080]   - Hundreds by semi-secret software, is that the one?
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.280]   - Yeah, and we actually had the pleasure
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.800]   of doing an hour-long interview with Adam
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:59.840]   about the game and we'll have that up on Friday.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:00.680]   - Oh, oh, fun.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.440]   - The way he thinks about level design is really interesting.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.640]   - I'm downloading it right now, $4.99.
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:08.840]   All right. (laughing)
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.960]   My life is over.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.800]   Adam angst, your pick of the week.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.440]   - Well, one of the things that's been bothering me
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:19.800]   for a long, long time about the whole social media scene
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.480]   is the fact that you kind of have to choose.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:23.680]   I don't want to choose.
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.880]   I want to do, post to one thing and have it go everywhere else.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.720]   It's like the cross-posting debate.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.280]   And the simple fact is I see myself as a publisher
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.080]   and people can choose to read me wherever they wish.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.480]   And the best place I've found for the sort of starting
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.680]   my post is Google+, and there's a new service called
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.680]   friends plus me.
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:48.680]   That's www.friendsplus.b, which is the first of these things
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:52.840]   I've seen that doesn't feel like a really serious hack.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.000]   There's been a ton of little ways of getting Google+,
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.120]   to cross post to Twitter and to Facebook,
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:01.480]   but they've really all been pretty horary behind the scenes.
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:06.480]   And so, friends plus me, it's got an attractive dashboard
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.960]   and it just works.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.920]   Ooh, that Apple's saying that it just seems to work.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.760]   There's nothing too fussy about it.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.400]   You want to post something from Google+,
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.080]   to the other services.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.760]   You can either do so via a hashtag or just say,
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:22.760]   everything that goes to the public should be sent on.
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:25.480]   The only downside of course is that when you're not limited
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:28.960]   to 140 characters on Twitter, things get truncated
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:31.200]   and there has to be a URL sent in the back
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.680]   to the Google+, people on Twitter sending them back
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:37.400]   to the Google+ page to be able to read the full thing.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.920]   But, you know, as I said, certain level of,
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:45.120]   I'm just tired of having to think about each of these places
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.040]   as a different venue.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.280]   I don't ever post to Facebook, so cross posting
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.800]   from one of these other sites is the best way
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.320]   to get me there at all.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:55.960]   And Google+ has been working pretty well for me.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.320]   - You know, the only thing it puzzles me about
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.320]   is the website look is a rip off of the Squarespace.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:03.080]   So that's friends plus me and that's the Squarespace site.
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:04.600]   Friends plus me. - Maybe they're using Squarespace.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.440]   - Squarespace, maybe it is Squarespace, I don't know.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.120]   I looked at the bottom, I didn't see it, but boy,
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.000]   that's, maybe this is just like,
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.240]   this is the new look, all sites.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.640]   Some day all sites will look like this.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.600]   - And you have to, you can't automatically post
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.000]   to Google+ so that has to be the origin of all your stuff.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.960]   - Ah, and that's key 'cause Google+ does not have
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:24.200]   a right API, so like all of these plugins,
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:27.200]   you start at Google+ and then it goes to Facebook.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.640]   - I believe there actually is starting to be a right API.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.320]   I just got email from a service we use
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:34.640]   called Deliverate, dlvr.it.
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:36.040]   - It was a two. - And we have posts
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:38.680]   that posts our, the tipitsnoots headlines
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:40.360]   to our Facebook page.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.840]   And they just said, if you have a pro
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.200]   or a premium account on Deliverate,
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.200]   you can, you know, we'll post to Google+ for your nanos.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.120]   - Really? - It's possible
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.120]   that that API is opening up in a small way.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.840]   - Interesting.
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:53.280]   - But the Google+ app, I have to say,
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.760]   the Google+ apps on the iPhone and the iPad are really pretty.
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.080]   - Yeah. - They're a little stupid
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:01.080]   at two ways, you know, if the post fails,
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.520]   for whatever reason, it just loses everything you typed.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:07.840]   But it's still a pretty system and, you know,
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.760]   it feels more flip board-like than just
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:12.120]   a reading Twitter or whatnot on the iPhone.
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:15.600]   So, as that, you know, I actually almost never read any
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.440]   of these services, I deal with them as a publisher,
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.760]   so I'm in right only mode.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:21.040]   But, but nonetheless, I'll respond to whatever people
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.760]   reply back.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.920]   - I'm gonna mention something that comes
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:27.200]   from our sponsor Squarespace, actually.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.600]   I don't know if anybody's mentioned this before.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:31.040]   It came out in October, it's free and it's really cool.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.360]   You don't have to have a Squarespace account.
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.640]   It's called Squarespace Note.
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.000]   And I know a lot of our audience has started to use it
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.040]   and I thought, you know, I probably should talk about this.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.320]   It's an iPhone app, but I could show it on the iPad.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320]   It works just fine.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:47.320]   It's a way of taking notes on your iPhone
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:51.760]   that then you share with lots of other places.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.880]   The folks at Squarespace have a pretty advanced
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.680]   iOS development team.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:02.160]   So, they've done a great job, I think,
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:07.160]   of keeping their own iPhone and iPad app up-to-date.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.440]   And Squarespace Note allows you, and I thought,
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.600]   Andy, since you mentioned that you use Evernote,
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.680]   you might be interested in this.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.760]   It's just a new interface to Evernote in effect
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.960]   'cause it will save to Evernote.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:19.280]   It'll also save to Squarespace.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.880]   You can email it, Twitter or Facebook or Dropbox.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.880]   But it's got a very nice note-taking app
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.760]   that's just elegant as heck.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.560]   I can't figure out how to get back into it
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.640]   because I started to share a note.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.480]   That's the other thing.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.800]   It's a lot, oh, there we go.
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:35.640]   Here we go.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:37.320]   So, it's very clean.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:41.560]   You just type your note and then you slide down.
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:42.400]   Let's see, is that right?
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.240]   Nope.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.280]   Maybe he's just slide.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:46.120]   Oh, yeah, nope.
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:50.840]   You slide it from the left to see your other notes.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.440]   You slide down.
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:55.960]   I always have trouble sliding down on iOS to send your note
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:58.240]   and then you can send it to all these other places.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.120]   Never mind, forget I even mentioned it.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:02.360]   It's clean.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.240]   A lot of people recommend it.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.600]   It's a very clean way of sharing, of creating notes.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:07.680]   You would like it, Andy,
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.520]   'cause I know you want a very simple clean.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.400]   My promise, maybe I could just never get this.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.080]   How do you get this keyboard off a year?
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.000]   I don't want that keyboard.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.400]   Anyway, there's more stuff underneath there I can't get to.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:22.240]   Forget it.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.080]   Free.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:23.920]   Use it.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:24.760]   (laughing)
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:25.840]   You might like, I don't use it,
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.760]   but a lot of people recommended this.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.880]   And so I thought I'd give Squarespace a little plug for it.
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:30.880]   They've really done a nice job.
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:33.800]   Beautiful, simple, clean.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:36.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this edition
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.040]   of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.520]   I do want to thank our talented team,
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:40.600]   especially you, Adam Anxt,
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.800]   for making time in your busy day.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:43.640]   Thank you, thank you.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.400]   Join us, we always love having you on.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.400]   Is it freezing, cold, and snowing?
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:51.480]   I wish, as I said, it was 55 degrees a couple days ago.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.320]   It's freezing.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.080]   All of our snow is gone.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.720]   I'm gonna have to move north at some point.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.880]   You're in Upper New York State,
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.040]   and it's 55 degrees, I don't get it.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.200]   We have put in here, Adam, do it.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.200]   Yeah, I think--
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:08.080]   Up in Montreal, you've got snow, I'm sure.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.400]   Yeah, it's melting into ice, and then re-freezing,
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.680]   and then melting again and re-freezing,
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.120]   so we have layer cake ice now.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.240]   Layer cake ice.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:15.080]   I'm on his house.
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.760]   It's a special kind of ice,
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.440]   just for people who like to live in the frozen north.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.640]   Yeah, thank you for being here.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.600]   Adam Anxt is at tidbits.com.
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:27.320]   That is a great place to go to subscribe to his free
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.840]   tidbits weekly newsletter.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.560]   Although, my recommendation, if you like it,
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.080]   is to become a sustaining supporter,
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.200]   because your contribution, if you're a member,
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.840]   keeps tidbits going, and you just do such a great job.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.440]   It's such a resource, the longest running Macintosh
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:51.400]   to publication, 21 years.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.240]   And in the whole--
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.240]   We actually got in a new number there, Leo.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.400]   We are now the oldest publication,
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.280]   internet only publication around.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:02.120]   Wow.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:04.080]   Yeah, the previous record holder,
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.760]   the people that was the Irish immigrant news,
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.480]   they retired last year.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.720]   They folded.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.400]   It was great.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.600]   Finally, a barry-n-up.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:12.640]   You're barry-n-up, Adam.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:13.240]   Yeah, you know.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:14.240]   You put 'em at it.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.600]   That was the beauty part.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.160]   I didn't wish them any ill at all.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.160]   I didn't want them to go under anything like that.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.280]   And they retired.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:22.480]   It just got old.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.320]   It was perfect.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.760]   The winner of Survivor Newsletter.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.080]   (laughing)
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.240]   So, well, that's nice.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.120]   The oldest running, longest running,
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.800]   internet publication of them all.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.680]   You are the London Times of the technical press.
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:36.520]   Online press.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:37.440]   You can see the only one.
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.600]   They also do those great take control e-books.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.560]   Another wonderful resource you can find it all at
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.320]   tidbits.com.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.800]   Renee's from imore.com.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:52.200]   The king of the iPad iPhone rumor mill.
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.920]   iPhone 5S, what do you think?
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:54.760]   June?
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:57.160]   It's gonna be interesting this year
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:58.760]   because there is this big spring period
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:39:59.960]   where they've released everything,
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.800]   but traditionally they have iOS devices.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.840]   So you're anticipating the iPad mini
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.680]   with a retina display, a thinner, lighter iPad 4
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.320]   with a new design language.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.960]   And however many iPhones they released this year.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:12.320]   So it's gonna be an interesting year.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.400]   But you do have a big article saying,
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.840]   forget the new hardware.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:19.680]   2013's all about iOS 7 and iCloud.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.120]   I really believe that.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:24.680]   So from your lips to Tim's ears,
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.960]   I hope you're right.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.240]   'Cause they could both use a little bit of a...
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:30.000]   Adjustment.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:30.840]   Kicking the pants.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.800]   Yeah, kicking the pants.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.880]   There's the phrase I was looking for.
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.920]   From the Chicago Sun times and regular here,
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.800]   of course Andy and not co-always with pleasure Andy.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.640]   You didn't miss anything,
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.320]   not going to Vegas, I could tell you that much.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.000]   You coming out for Macworld?
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.040]   No, I'm afraid not.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.320]   Ah, bummer.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.600]   But to Adam, you and will be.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:49.800]   What are your plans for Macworld?
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:52.360]   Are you gonna be, are you doing your party?
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:56.640]   If you're available for the vast media conspiracy dinner.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.640]   I liked it.
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.640]   I might come up a couple of days early and visit Uleo.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:01.240]   Please do Renee, that'd be fun.
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.920]   I'll let you play with my new 27-inch iMac,
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:04.920]   which is right behind.
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:05.760]   Awesome.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.720]   I got it with the Fusion Drive on it.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:11.560]   So the next thing I really wanna do is spend some time.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.960]   It's funny thing 'cause you can't really test
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:16.120]   the Fusion Drive very easily
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:19.360]   because it supposedly gets faster as you use it.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:22.560]   I just thought of a really mean-spirited practical joke
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.360]   that I'm gonna be able to do.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.560]   I just thought of a really mean-spirited practical joke
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:29.880]   that people with that office could do to you.
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:32.080]   What they could do is just take a half-inch strip
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.920]   of masking tape and put it on the side of it.
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.360]   And then people wouldn't have no idea
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:39.000]   that you'd actually have the brand new iMac there
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.520]   'cause otherwise we'll look exactly the same
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.680]   as last year's model.
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:44.840]   I actually, I can't get up 'cause I'm wired in,
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:47.640]   but we wanted to get a pedestal or something to rotate it.
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:49.480]   'Cause from the front, yeah, it looks like the,
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.160]   and even from this, you know,
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.640]   when you see the bulge, it doesn't look that thin,
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.840]   but there's one angle.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.240]   It looks really, really thin.
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:57.600]   Okay, here comes Chad.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.080]   Chad is going to rote, oh look.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.520]   Wow, there it is.
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.680]   From that angle, it disappears.
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:04.640]   It just disappears.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.480]   If you're watching-
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:06.320]   It's too dimensional.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.480]   It's flatland.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:11.160]   And I got, you know, I got, I got 16 gigs of RAM
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:14.960]   and i7 3.4 gigahertz i7.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:18.600]   And what else did I get in there?
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.280]   The Fusion Drive, three terabyte Fusion Drive.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:22.880]   So I'm excited, I'll be playing with it
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.480]   and I'll give you some,
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.120]   you can see my dates on that.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.680]   It's pretty, I gotta say it's light.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.160]   It's the first thing you notice.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.080]   I'm sure that your iMac steward
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.920]   will be very, very pleased that you upgraded.
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.880]   (laughing)
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:39.800]   You know what they wanted to use it for?
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:40.960]   And I said, you can't.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:42.000]   They wanna use my old one,
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.680]   which is only a year old now,
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:48.840]   with a very fast processor and dual drives SSD
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:49.960]   and spinning drive.
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:50.800]   Well, you were gonna use it for what?
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.240]   A Skype test machine, right?
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.680]   A Skype test machine.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:54.800]   No.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.280]   We don't have any other,
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.000]   we have too many computers here.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.360]   Well, I'm not giving it away.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.040]   See, don't say that 'cause then the chat room's gonna say,
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:02.560]   well, you can give it to me.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.840]   You can give it to me.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.920]   Anyway, no, we'll find something good for it.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:09.680]   The last one, my last iMac is now at the front desk
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.360]   for reception where my daughter last summer
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.840]   during her summer internship watched
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:18.960]   all eight seasons of the office in sequence.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.880]   Well, a lot going on at the front desk.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.440]   You need seven Lio, like Steve Jobs,
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.400]   you know, every year you can add a new one.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.480]   That's an idea.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.760]   There you go.
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:27.720]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:30.360]   We do a Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.440]   Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time,
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.520]   1900 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:36.240]   Do watch live, love to have the chat room.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.240]   It's always fun to have you watching
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:41.040]   and listening and communicating with us.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.880]   But if you can't, don't worry.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.960]   You can always catch any audio and video
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.040]   that we do here in the Twit Break House
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.160]   on demand after the fact.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.760]   Just download it from twit.tv
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:53.880]   or wherever finer podcasts are stored.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:56.560]   And if you choose to use the patent and fringing iTunes,
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.060]   be it on your own head.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:01.320]   No, no, please be my guest.
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:02.160]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:03.000]   We'll see you next time.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.200]   Another, now get back to work.
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:06.040]   Break time.
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:07.680]   I can't, I never remember the ending of this.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:09.200]   Break time is over.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.040]   Take care.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:15.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:20.200]   (upbeat music)
