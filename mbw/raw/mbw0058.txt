[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Time for MacBreak Weekly and MacBreak Weekly today.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Features, I'm so pleased to say Chris Breen from the
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Mac 911 column in Macworld magazine.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Of course, he's a regular on the Apple phone show.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I'm sure every other Mac podcast should be a regular on this one.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I don't know why we've unaccountably not had you on more often, but welcome, Chris.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Well, it's great to be back.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Thanks, Lee.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Old buddy, old friend, old pal.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Are you going on Mac the Mac crews in November?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   No, I'm not.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I was on the list to go, and then something came up and they said,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   "Ah, you were the last one to be invited."
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Oh, not.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   That's too bad.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Well, I'm not going either, so there you go.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Okay.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   That's the answer I said.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I said, "Uh-oh, something's happening.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   You sound like Donald Duck."
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Did you all of a sudden start downloading email?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   No.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   That's a neat effect.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   You know, I have reason to believe that Chris Breen might be a silon.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I think that's as a red light going up and down his back right now.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Talk some more, Chris.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I'm talking some more.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You sound just like a silon.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   This is what we should have made the mackerelope sound like.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Chris, I'm going to hang up on you and call you right back, okay?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Merlin, let's start over.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Merlin, man, I just edited it.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Make it all smooth and silk.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You'd never know it happened, if I remember.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Merlin, man is also here from 43 Folders in the Merlin Man Show at the merlinmanshow.com.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And 43folders.com.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Hello there.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   How are you today?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Suffering from a massive head cold.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I think something like crawled into my nose and like laid eggs.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Machelion.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Something very unpleasant has happened and I'm under the weather.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   No, I'm totally loopy and high on the cold medicine.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   That's good.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That makes it for a wonderful matter.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah, whenever you can be looping high, we hope you will join us.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I'm loopy and high.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Chris Brin's proud of it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Alex Lindsay is also here at an undisclosed location somewhere, a Hilton somewhere in the world.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's actually a Marriott.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   They change, you know, these guys, they buy and sell each other's hotels.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So it's a Marriott in Burbank.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I'm actually waiting for a meeting.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So I'm in the quietest place I can find in the Marriott lobby.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   None of you are at surprise to hear TechCrunch 40, which is going on in San Francisco right now.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You don't care about Web 2.0?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   What is that about?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Is that for 40 year old people?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, you're not too young, are you?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   You're right there.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I would just get in.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   You must be this tall to monetize.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   You just got it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I like it.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Mike Harrington's conference going on right now in San Francisco and I'm just watching.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I just watched Twitter Pounce and Jai Koon.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You know, you get basically get the whole conference that way.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's the easiest way to do it.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Chris Brin's a lucky dog.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   He has all the new iPods.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I do.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Well, I don't have the shuffle because it's not.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   No, because I didn't need one in Celery or a tote.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   What do they call them?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Do they have funny names for them?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   No, no, they don't.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Actually, I was expecting that.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I thought that was going to be sort of the restoration hardware show.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So then everything is sort of these non-color colors.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   But they are actually those non-color colors, but they don't apply those names to them.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So they say green, but rather than they mean celery.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Celery.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Yeah, my wife would say, I'm sure your wife too.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That's what women do.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   They say, oh, no, that's celery.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Right.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It's green.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   What are you talking about?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I have.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   That's not, that's not pink.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   That's shrimp.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Shrimp.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I once told my wife once asked me what her shirt looked like and I, whether it worked or not.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And I told her it was too desaturated for the pants.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Only you, Alex.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Literally, it literally took her at about six months before she was, she was sure.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   This is what we were dating.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Whether she was sure I was straight.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.960]   That's too desaturated for the pants.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   I love your specular highlights on your earrings though.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.520]   Honey, that waistline needs some unsharp matte.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.120]   We can goo that.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.520]   So by the way, I talked to a plastic surgeon.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.880]   I had a long talk at a dinner party with a plastic surgeon the other night and he told
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.720]   me that he used to use kai power tools goo to demonstrate what the post surgery is going
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.360]   to look like.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.400]   Now he uses basically the same plugin in Photoshop.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.920]   He said, don't they sell special?
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   He said, yeah, but goo is much better.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   This is so very, very scientific.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   He's, you know what?
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.760]   He's one of the top plastic surgeons in the area.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.920]   Are you getting plastic surgery, Leo?
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.360]   They said, show me what it would look like without the love handles.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.360]   He goes, what do I like this?
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.360]   And like this.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.360]   Actually, you've done that for me.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.440]   Anyway, so tell us about the iPod touch.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.840]   Compare it to the iPhone, Chris Breen.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   Here it's a little smaller and thinner.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.240]   It's a little smaller and thinner.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.520]   It has no external buttons other than for turning it on and off, which is a problem because
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.080]   a lot of people use iPods, put them in their pockets, especially if you're writing on an
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.720]   unsavory subway somewhere.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.760]   Oh, you're going to have to look it out, aren't you?
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.860]   I mean, we know you've got an iPod because we see the white earbuds, but it may be a
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.560]   shuffle and you may not be worth killing over this.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.840]   In this case, however, they've got, you have to take it out.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.160]   There is no way to turn the volume up and down without taking it out of your pocket.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.760]   And so either you leave it on in the last year's either you don't hear loud enough or you
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.680]   sort of hide it, you know, surreptitiously inside your book or something so that you
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   turn to pay 72 and then you can turn up the volume or change tracks.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.960]   That's too bad because I really like the rocker on the iPhone.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.800]   I think that's very handy.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   It is very handy.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.920]   And you look at the design, you think, well, why didn't you do it?
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.800]   And we all know that the reason that the iPhone's headphone port is recessed is because
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.080]   Apple liked it that way.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.440]   And they liked the look of it and it has nothing to do with anything other than that.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.880]   So I think this is another decision where they said, oh, you know, that volume switch
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.320]   looks a little ugly there.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   So let's take it on.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.680]   Sure, it'll be less useful, but the lines are beautiful.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   Right.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.120]   That's the blessing and the curse of Steve Jobs, really.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.120]   I think.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.240]   I mean, don't you think Steve decides all of this stuff?
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.600]   You, yeah, I imagine he has a huge, obviously huge amount of input into it.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.200]   I could really use a few more little buttons.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.800]   He's saying he's a murderer.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.520]   He doesn't like buttons every time I try to use that Mighty Mouse.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.680]   I was using it today.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.920]   It drives me crazy.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   Hate that thing.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   It's weird.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.960]   I haven't, I still haven't gotten over the Mighty Mouse.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.640]   I'm afraid it's the first thing I tend to do when I get a computer to get a free button
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.640]   mouse.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.640]   It's painful to use.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.680]   You know, you keep double clicking my accident, which by default opens X, Bizet or no, the
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.680]   dashboard or something.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.040]   And then you have to lift the finger.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.040]   I mean, I just, it's sorry.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.320]   I just, it's a bad.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.320]   So again, once again, the anti button contingency wins again.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.200]   Was there some rumor going around that there'd be some adjustment where when you double click
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.680]   on the home button on, well, there's a home button on the, on the touch as well as the
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.680]   iPhone, right?
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.680]   And was there some talk where if you double click on that, it would take you to like a
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   place of your choosing?
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.680]   Doesn't it?
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.440]   Well, we lost Chris again.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   Doesn't it do?
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.640]   I think it does volume control, but let's get Chris back because he's the, he's the, he's
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.200]   the arbiter of all things.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   So Chris, I'm sorry.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   We lost you again.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   My, my connection today is hinky.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.960]   Are you on wireless?
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.040]   No, I'm wired.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.880]   It's just an ounce of bunnies and stuff.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.760]   So we were talking about buttons.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.760]   We were talking about button.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760]   Ethernet cables.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.760]   Wouldn't that be nice to have?
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   We were talking about buttons at what, when you double tap the home button, doesn't it
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.080]   do something special on the touch?
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.520]   What happens with the iPod touch, which is a very nice feature is that you double tap
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:26.840]   it and up a little screen that will allow you to adjust volume and use next and previous
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   buttons.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.000]   And also you can go directly to the now playing screen.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.160]   And that's a, that's a minor glitch with the iPhone that when you back yourself into other
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.360]   parts of the interface and you need to get back to the iPod area, you have to tap like
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   three or four times to get back there.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.280]   This allows you to do it just with the home button.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.800]   It feels to me, and it's, it's one of the things it does bug me with the iPhone.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.720]   It feels to me like pressing the back button in the browser.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.120]   You kind of dig yourself up out of that hole so you can go back down another hole.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.240]   And I, just to me, that's a UI mistake.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.880]   I noticed when I get a call and if I'm listening to music and I get a call and I just, I love
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.880]   the way the music paused.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   It's very cool.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.880]   And it's really nice.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   It's very classy.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.720]   And then you have your call and then all of a sudden the craft work starts blaring again.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.760]   And it takes like five clicks, you know, to get there to be able to pause it if you don't
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.920]   want to listen to anyone.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.760]   That's why, I mean, I have to say you've got to start using the earbuds and the little
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.840]   clicker thing in there because the pause is just a single click.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.080]   Double click goes to next song.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   And then the rockers handy.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.840]   I think those little devices really make a big difference because the rocker you can
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.360]   turn it down right away.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   Anyway, so the touch thumbs up of a PC magazine seemed to love it.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.280]   I'm actually going to put my thumb in the middle on this one because the display is
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   not good.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.440]   Well, there's already complaints about that.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.640]   It's the contrast in that.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.160]   But some people are returning them.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.800]   What is exactly not good about it?
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   Well, okay.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   Well, here are the good ones and the bad ones.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.440]   The good ones are darker than the iPhone and it has a yellow or cast.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.680]   The bad ones are really dark.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.600]   So for example, I was watching Chinatown on both the iPhone and the iPod touch on the
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   bad one.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.440]   It is so dark, it almost has an X-ray effect.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.200]   So that you see anything bright, the contrast is completely blown out and there's no contrast
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.440]   adjustment on this thing, just brightness.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.240]   So if you get a bad one, yes, you should take it back to Apple.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.800]   However, even the good ones, you lose all detail in any dark area.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.840]   So if you're looking at a film noir, if you're looking at something like Chinatown, you're
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.040]   really going to be lost a lot of the time, even when you have brightness cranked all
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.960]   the way up, which is too bad.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.440]   So obviously it's a different display.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   They're using on this one.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.920]   It has a different pixel density.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.160]   I spoke with Apple about it yesterday and their answer was, "Huh, well, we've never seen
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.160]   that before."
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.960]   Well, they're going to hear about it.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.120]   I mean, it's around the web now and we said, "Great, we'll send you ours."
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.680]   And so they're going to see one.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:52.280]   Yeah, DSL reports has a long forum post on the issues.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.480]   So there's at least, so we've always thought that we know, in fact, there are two different
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480]   iPhone screens there.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.960]   So there are at least two different iTouch screens as well.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.080]   And we're not sure what differentiates them or we're not sure how Apple is treating the
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.400]   issue right now.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.320]   And there are other little things like you can enter contact events on your iPod Touch.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.320]   Great.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   And you can enter calendar events?
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   No.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   Isn't that bizarre?
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320]   It is bizarre.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.800]   And again, it was another question to Apple.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.960]   I said, "This seems a little arbitrary to me that I can put contacts in making it kind
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.680]   of like a personal information manager.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.400]   And yet, why can't I do calendars?"
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:34.800]   And their answer was, "Well, you should really look at contacts as being a bonus."
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.680]   Not that we turned off calendars, but you looked at it, we forgot to turn off contacts.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.640]   You're lucky we didn't break both your arms.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.440]   That's a bonus.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   Only one kneecap, Mr. Mann.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.000]   That is lame.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.200]   I mean, is that something that sounds to me like some kind of cheesy last minute, you
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.640]   know, guys sitting around a table kind of decision.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.720]   I mean, is there a functional reason to not allow you to do contact stuff?
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.640]   Do they want to not feel like a PDA?
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.760]   Like you've got to buy the phone to get the PDA like feeling?
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.800]   It's not a functional reason.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.960]   There's an economic reason.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.000]   I think that I hate it when I would come.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I've seen this before when I see companies arbitrarily cripple something just because
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.400]   they want to make more money on another product.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   That's cheesy.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   That's just cheesy.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.680]   I mean, didn't tell did that with a Celeron and we called them on that.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.840]   And it's just really bad.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.280]   I hacked my iPhone.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.280]   You know, Alex, you were touting this in ROGAMIBA, or no, I'm sorry, the Ambrosia software,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.280]   or ringtone.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   And Apple's response was to put out 742, which broke it, right?
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:36.120]   Well, no, no, it broke all the other hacks currently with iTunes 1.1, and I think in an
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.080]   upcoming update, all of those still work.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   Oh, good.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.360]   So, you know, Itoner has really, it's not just like a little hack, like just changed
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360]   the name.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.800]   They're really, you know, Andrews really dig it into the tune there is digging into the
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.560]   what they need to do to make it really work.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.440]   ROGAMIBA has a free one as well, and I guess that one no longer works.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.920]   Yeah, but I think the only one that works currently is Itoner.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.360]   I have one that works, but I'm going to talk about that as my software.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360]   Okay.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.640]   Because it requires jailbreaking the phone.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   Right.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.360]   The great thing about this one is you don't have to do anything to your iPhone.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   Right.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.840]   You don't have to do anything there to make it work at all works.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.120]   It all makes sense at all.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.000]   You know, so that's the thing that, and I'm afraid I've been too afraid of really, you
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   know, playing with my phone.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.400]   I am totally, I have not done a thing.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.400]   I'm usually going crazy.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.960]   I'm crazy, but you know why I went crazy?
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.360]   Because somebody sent me a second phone.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:33.080]   I have the same exact reluctance to mess with my main phone because I, you know, I didn't
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.880]   want to end up with a brick when Apple does an update or whatever.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.840]   But now I feel much more confident because I have a pawnbroker.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.560]   Because apparently there's quite a few iPhones being pawned in the ball, ballmer area.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.400]   He says, we have a lot of, we have a lot of universities here.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.200]   A lot of kids go back to school to decide they need the money, whatever something happens.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.640]   And we were getting a lot of funds and I said, well, good, I'll buy it from you.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.880]   So no, no, no, let me just send it to you because I'd like to hear what happens.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.240]   So I hacked this one up the gills because I, you know, I could.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   Right.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.120]   And is still working pretty well.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.120]   What I'll broke.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.880]   Well, let me, let me, I'll tell you actually the whole saga.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.040]   So it was a one oh two, the latest firmware version.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.600]   There has been, as we record this and I have to say, I should begin every podcast, every
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.360]   Mac break weekly this way.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.240]   It's Tuesday 11 30 in the morning.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.200]   As we record this September 18th so far at this time, no invites from Apple to appear
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.800]   anywhere.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.400]   No firmware updates.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.600]   The thing of course will happen as soon as we get off this recording.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.760]   But as of now it's one oh two a shoebie.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.120]   You know, she'll be my assistant did this first and he's actually got a very good step
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.600]   by step that he took from the eye on lock.no site.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   You could use that as well.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.880]   Although I followed Shubbies.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.400]   First thing you have to do is jailbreak it.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.120]   Now that just merely means you're, you're making it so that you could put stuff on the
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.760]   phone and the jailbreak is very simple.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.760]   There are a number of them.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.520]   As I activate, I fantastic.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.720]   I used and this is going to be my pick.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.440]   So I should well, I'll just give you my pick now.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:14.040]   I used app tap, which is from no river and it is really, really excellent.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.720]   It actually is the first thing you should do even if you don't plan to unlock your phone
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.640]   because it what it does is allows you to put applications.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.840]   It's the standalone application tool.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   It's very straightforward.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.000]   You just hook up your phone.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.120]   The key on this is to get out of iTunes.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.840]   I actually turned off the iTunes helper.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.600]   So iTunes would stop launching.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.920]   iTunes has this bad habit of launching again and again and again.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.880]   But if you turn off iTunes helper, you don't see iTunes.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.040]   This is a desktop application that you run and it just runs right over the USB and gets
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   to the phone.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040]   Wow.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:55.480]   It is so easy that I'm thinking it's iphone.noriver.com/beta.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.280]   I'm thinking there really isn't a lot of negatives to this.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.160]   You run app tap, it puts it on your phone and then you have, it will install other applications.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.560]   So it adds an icon to that fourth row.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.760]   You click that icon and you can install other applications and there's a lot of good applications.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   In fact, the first thing you do is install the community sources, which is a whole lot
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.760]   more applications.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.920]   What it really is is kind of like an apt get, probably is apt get for the OS 10 that's on
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.920]   the phone.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:29.280]   If you've used BSD, you know, or some Linux as you know is a very handy installer for Unix.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.640]   It's a command line based installer.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.880]   It just downloads what you need, compiles it and makes it work.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:39.760]   So you suddenly have access to a dozen or so, maybe more packages, including a full BSD
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.280]   subsystems, you install that.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.840]   SSH, so you install that.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:51.160]   And I'll explain the, one of the things you'd, Erica Sedoon, who writes for TUAW, the
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.800]   artificial Apple web log and has really has been a great hacker in the iPhone community,
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.560]   has written a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.640]   I'm glad Scott Born's not here, by the way, because I think he'd be steaming out the
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.080]   ears at this point.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   He would not be happy.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.360]   Scott's not with us this week, but we'll fill him in.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.440]   He could throw stuff later.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.080]   Well, make sure he's standing somewhere where the steam can come out of his ears.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.720]   Oh, you did one.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.240]   But I get a special lesson.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.880]   Again, I didn't do it to my main phone.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.960]   My main phone is pristine, and I'm very fortunate to have this kind of backup phone that I could
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   do this to.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.800]   But you're saying nothing broke so far with what you've done.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.960]   Well, and I'll tell you a couple of things.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.880]   No, it's going to be, this is going to be like a trip to Las Vegas, right?
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.000]   Where like you sit around and you play blackjack, blackjack by yourself on the computer all
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.760]   day long and you make $5,000 a day.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.080]   And then the one time you go to Vegas, you're going to lose your shirt.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.480]   And it could very easily happen.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.000]   And I want to absolutely disclaim this that it is, you know, risky.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.480]   Now Apple has, Jaws stepped forward last week and Apple kind of stepped back a little
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.480]   bit from this.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.240]   But Jaws said, Hey, we don't mind if you put, you know, applications in your phone.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.120]   We don't even say we don't mind if you unlock it.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.560]   I'm sure they do mind that.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.120]   Although, and I have to say, as soon as I did this, every time now I sync up with iTunes,
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.720]   Apple says, we'd like to send back information, anonymous information about your phone to
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   Apple.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.320]   Would you give us permission to do this?
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.160]   I bet that happens whenever it throws some kind of an exception or something like that.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160]   Have you seen that before?
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   I've gotten that.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   I have gotten that before.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   We're not going to send your personal information.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.160]   Right.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.800]   I still say no, I don't want them to know what I've done.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   I'm embarrassed.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.440]   I'm not ready to go to the confessional.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.840]   Well, I think it's also them trying to, you know, obviously if they wanted to block it,
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.040]   that gives them the information that they need to right figure out what, you know, what's
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.640]   going, you know, what's getting moved around.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.760]   So app, app taps very straightforward.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.960]   It's very easy.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.720]   It is just like installing an application on any phone, not iPhone, obviously, but any
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.440]   other phone it runs through over the USB takes about two or three minutes.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.920]   It has to download some firmware.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.760]   You tell it with firmware version and it has to download some software, puts it on the
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.160]   phone, gives you access to all of these things.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.240]   The next step is to put SSH on there.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.200]   And now this is where it gets a little Unix-y, a little wonky.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.640]   You use SSH to log into your phone from your Mac.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.440]   It's just really cool.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.440]   Wow.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.040]   And app tap will let you do this?
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.800]   Well, no, what you've done is you've, app tap lets you install the BSD app tap.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.160]   You could just install tic-tac-toe and leave it at that.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.160]   You don't have to do anything else.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.280]   Once you run app tap and you've got that thing running, you just have to say shit.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.280]   Now it's jailbroken.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.280]   Wow.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.520]   And so it's the easiest way.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.320]   Can you see it on your desktop after you've done the jailbreak?
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   You see the...
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.640]   Yeah, the phone behaves exactly the same as before.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.920]   Oh, you mean do you now see it as a disc?
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.920]   No.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   Okay.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.640]   The phone behaves exactly as it did before, which is kind of odd.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.720]   So anyway, so you run these SSH commands.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.600]   And you know, there's a few steps.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.440]   You're going to copy some files over there.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.440]   I used SCP, which is the standard kind of Unix command line copy.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.200]   You could use FTP to do it as well, but you copy some files.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.800]   You need about, you need five different files.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.240]   I unlock an ICE file, NOR, MiniCom and BBUpdater.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.560]   These are the files you'll need.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.840]   You issue some Unix commands that basically consist of putting some key files on there,
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.400]   changing the auto run, the startup, and the most important one is you use MiniCom, which
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.720]   is, believe it or not, a little terminal program to change the modem on the phone to
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.560]   allow it to use other carriers.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.920]   After you've done that, and it literally, it's about 10 Unix command lines, you're done.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.000]   I put the T-Mobile SIM in and it works.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.240]   If it would help your Bulmer, a pawn shop friend, I'd be happy to look at a free phone.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.920]   It's pretty cool.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.160]   I want to, just if that would be helpful, you can send me a free file.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.200]   David, if you want to send Merlin one and he'll talk about you too.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.560]   I'm just looking for myself.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.360]   We'd all be happy to.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.680]   I just looked at the Mac update page for this and I went, "You know what?
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.880]   You don't want to do this to your own phone.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880]   I understand."
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   I don't know.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   Maybe I'm just looking.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.440]   Having done this, I'm still be a real lucky.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.840]   Now, a couple of things happen.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.440]   One is, all of a sudden the phone was filled with something.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.280]   You know how it shows different colors of what you've got?
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.600]   There's an orange color for, I don't know, what the hell's on there.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.600]   Almost all of the 8GB was full of something.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.120]   So I said, "Well, I'm going to do a restore.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.560]   This is a good chance to see what survives the restore."
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.640]   I did a full restore where you press the restore button and it wipes everything out.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.320]   The phone was still unlocked.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   Interesting.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.160]   AppTap is still there.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.080]   So this stuff survives that stuff.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   For now.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.920]   And I'm sure that with this rumored 1.11 update, and that's by the way, apparently they're
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.960]   going to jump from 1.02 to 1.11.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.480]   But the rumor is that Apple will have this update and will break all this stuff.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.520]   So obviously, I'm not going to update this phone until I find out what the consequences.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.760]   Somebody's going to have to do it and tell us what happens.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.400]   When I think it's interesting, I've noticed myself, you know, because I never used the
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.480]   ringtones and now I'm excited about ringtones.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.040]   And I find myself just looking at iTunes, every single one that comes out now, deciding
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.840]   where the many features I really need.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   Well, you're definitely going to want.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.440]   When I put 742 on here, it doesn't affect the phone at all.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.640]   It doesn't affect the ringtones I put in there because I'm doing it in a different way.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.040]   I'm using Erica Sedun's program.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.880]   She has a really great program called Send Songs that allows you to email songs, but
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.760]   it also allows you to take any song from your library and just copy it to the ringtones
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.760]   folder.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.760]   So now this now I have any song that's in my library that I could play as a ringtone.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.400]   And by the way, I don't know if you read David Pogue's re I thought right on article.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.760]   In fact, I think he was maybe a little gentle about it on this craziness of ringtones.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.280]   Very good article in which he points out kind of the salient feature that I've kind
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.520]   of missed, which is why is it you have to pay an extra buck for a song you already paid
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.880]   for just because you're activating instead of activating it with a play button, you're
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.840]   activating it with somebody calling you.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.680]   Don't you have the song on your phone?
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.520]   Haven't you paid the right to play it back?
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.600]   Why should you pay an extra buck to play it back with a different button?
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   I agree.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.760]   Groover had a good piece about this.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.640]   It totally feels like a racket.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.440]   And the only way it doesn't seem like a racket is if you compare it to the hugely larger
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.640]   racket of ringtones that already exists.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.080]   It's cheaper than anybody else's.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.840]   Yeah, I mean, like for example, when I've gotten these free sprint phones in the past
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.840]   and you know, and they give me like the keys to whatever or get unlimited, whatever, you
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.640]   know, these ringtones, well, first of all, none of these games and all this crap you
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.320]   buy them, but then they expire.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   They expire.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.480]   Verizon's I think last year sprint lasts only six months, three months, something like
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.480]   that.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.200]   They're 250.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.400]   So the whole thing is a racket.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.080]   There's no question it's a racket and Apple's maybe a little less than a racket.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.080]   Groover and Dan, Daniel Silver of roughly drafted.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.800]   And I don't know if Daniel knows something or what.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.640]   Daniel wrote a really good piece, which John referred to saying that Apple had to do this.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.520]   That Apple wanted to give them away and the RIAA came back to them and said, no, you can't
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.520]   give them away.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.520]   Oh, let me.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.440]   Although, although isn't didn't the record industries actually push to say that ringtone
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.520]   weren't something that they had to pay royalties on?
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.520]   I believe.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.680]   I think it's an actually one of the things.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   Yeah, well, here's yes.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680]   Exactly.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.640]   What happens is that all the money goes to the RIAA or the labels, I should say, none
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   of it goes to the artists.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.800]   Because they've already said it's not a work.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.760]   So it's not held under that.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.080]   So why should we have to?
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   That's the big question.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080]   It's appalling.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.760]   It's just such a scam.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:22.480]   Anyway, so this to me means that I could do anything I want to unlock an Erica's solution
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.360]   isn't as good as iTunes because you can't pick what part.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.880]   If you wanted to do that, you have to edit it, upload it as a song, and then move that
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.560]   song over using Erica's utility.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.560]   But that's fine.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.800]   I've made all my ringtones.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.920]   You know, all my I have all the twit themes is my ringtones and stuff and it works fine.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.920]   And it survives a restore.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:45.120]   I should point out the only issue I had was the first time I restored it, I kind of freaked
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.880]   out because even though I had a T-Mobile sim in there, the phone said, okay, now we're going
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.680]   to activate with AT&T.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   I don't think that's going to work.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.480]   Yeah, that's on the door.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.600]   You don't know if that's a good idea.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   It turns out there is you have to put a certificate on there that says it's already been activated.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.600]   Just pay no attention.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.040]   I did that with I activate.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   No problem after that.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.560]   So it restore as of now does not impact this stuff.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.840]   You may have to reinstall apps because you're wiping off the apps that you've installed.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.040]   But the main hack, the unlock hack, isn't an app.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.240]   It changes the modem and the phone.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   Which is really interesting.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.760]   Apple could completely change that, of course.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.120]   And it's already building up a business.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.400]   I have some friends, obviously, in Africa that have already seen these iPhones starting
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.080]   to float around in many of those countries, which won't see an iPhone anytime soon, probably
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   for another year.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.360]   And it's becoming quite the gray market.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.720]   I mean, I get emails going, can you send a hundred?
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   These aren't from my...
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.480]   I know people who have a business on eBay, they buy the phones, they charge a hundred
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.040]   buck premium, they buy them, unlock them and send them to you.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   Yep.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.120]   So it's starting to really build up.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.040]   And it's one of those things that with a lot of these things that you're starting to
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:06.640]   see build up, even with this kind of Apple cutting everything off from Linux users.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.680]   So the iPod won't work with anything other than iTunes.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.600]   It doesn't take very long to kind of fix it.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   It's kind of like the market wants to go a certain direction.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.600]   If you go too much against where the market's going to go, it's going to go there anyway.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.880]   Sometimes it feels a little bit like Casablanca, where the...
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.680]   Who is it, the Claude Raines character is shocked, shocked to find gambling going on in here.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.680]   Exactly.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.960]   Where it seems like there's a certain amount of this stuff that to their vendors and their
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.200]   support people, they've got to put up a certain amount of fuss.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.280]   But then it's weird.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.680]   It's weird where they choose to clearly let stuff slide.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   It's fascinating to me.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.480]   I don't think Apple will let this slide.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.320]   I think that the next update will clearly change this.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.440]   Although the phone's working.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.160]   I've got all these apps on here now.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   Why do I need to update it?
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.440]   Well, the question is, is what you need to update?
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.000]   Whether an update to iTunes will eventually change the...
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.640]   Whether you could be able to sync to it with an older phone.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.640]   You know that.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   Absolutely.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.240]   And so I'm probably not advocating this.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.680]   On the other hand, it sure does open the market for all these...
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.800]   Look at all our friends in Canada.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:24.640]   Now they're sitting here and watching and Apple has announced O2 will be carrying the
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.520]   phone in the UK November 9th.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.200]   It's going to be in France, it's going to be in Germany, and all our friends now in...
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.800]   Where's the deal?
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.200]   Where's our phone?
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   Or Mexico.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   Where's our phone?
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   I think the Canadians are always left.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.200]   I don't know what Apple has against the Canadians.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.280]   Maybe now that Phil Schiller is living south of the border, you know, bad childhood or something
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.720]   in Saskatchewan or where...
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:55.400]   But they seem to get the iTunes store after everybody else and they really are sort of
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.600]   like the ugly stuff child.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:02.640]   I'm going to donate this hacked phone to a friend of mine who lives in Canada so that
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.200]   that person can put it on the Rogers Network.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   And we'll see what happens.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   We'll see how long it lasts.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.840]   Well I think the key to all this stuff is once you've got your iPhone exactly in the condition
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.200]   you want it, just never update it again.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   Right.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:22.160]   But you raise a good point, Alex is maybe I'll never be able to sync again either.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.200]   Which I have to admit, I almost never sunk my trio.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   So it would be nice but I'm not used to it yet.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   The past tense by the way.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   Past tense was sunk.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   I would like to sync my trio to the bay.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.800]   But I was afraid of literal laws.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.840]   Well it seems like there's a couple things you could do.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.720]   I mean if you get to a point where, you know, if you're somebody like me who enjoys being
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.840]   in the mode where you just kind of drag music over anyway.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.120]   I mean, you know, if you're willing to live in this little shadow world and you can be
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.600]   patient, you know, if you wait long enough stuff will probably come along that will fix
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   your problem.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   Well if you're...
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.880]   Well if you talk when I get to my pics there are a lot of really neat things you can do
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.200]   with the phone once you've jail broken it or whatever the past tense of that is.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   Jail broke.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.200]   Jail broke.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.880]   So we'll talk about that.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.920]   What do you think about the O2 announcement?
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.200]   269 pounds including VAT that's around $550.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   And it'll be down to whatever, $400 two months from now.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   Maybe.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.440]   Would you buy an iPhone right away?
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.680]   Not on your life governor.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.760]   There's some people, you know, there's some people that are going to buy them just like
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.680]   we did, you know, first day out.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.960]   They're going to go out and get them.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.320]   I mean, I needed there was going to be a price drop when I bought it.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.800]   So it wasn't, you know, wasn't that big of a deal to me.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.280]   And I think there'll be other people like that.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.640]   There'll be a lot of people who buy them at $550 and then they'll be upset, you know,
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.040]   in indignant when it drops to $400 or $450.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.800]   But in a very reserved sort of way.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   So.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   Yeah, we are reserving.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   Did you see Bill Maher?
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   Oh my God.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.160]   Did you see what Bill Maher said about the iPhone buyers?
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.640]   Yeah, it was pretty funny.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.040]   You know, I wasn't going to play this because I thought Scott Bourne might have a heart attack
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.640]   if I do, but he's not here right now.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.200]   So let me just, let me just play Bill Maher and his reaction to the iPhone price drop.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.840]   I will cut the price of the iPhone.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   Early adopters always pay a premium.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:20.520]   Early adopters being a business term, meaning dipchits who stand in line for six hours for
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.840]   a freaking phone.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.000]   It's not a price cut.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.840]   It's a repeal on the nerd tax.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.840]   I love it.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   I love that.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   If you didn't have to be the first on your block to have the latest gizmo, you'd now have
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.720]   an extra $200 to spend on your imaginary girlfriend.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.480]   You've got to love Bill Maher.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   I'll tell you.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.480]   That's a classic.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.280]   A repeal on the nerd tax.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.360]   Well having paid the nerd tax, I think I'm the only one here who paid that nerd tax.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   I agree.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.360]   I paid for the nerd tax.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.360]   Yeah, I did.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   You did two, Chris?
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.680]   Yeah, and I was in line for six hours.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.680]   Six hours, me too.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.920]   I'm afraid I was only in line for about 15 minutes, but that was all.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:13.360]   Now, here's a really sad part is I don't even really mind that I paid $200 too much for it.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.080]   No, I mean, it's like, I don't know what it is.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.560]   It's like going in and wanting to box with people and wondering why you keep getting a
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   bloody nose.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.080]   If you're going to try this stuff early on, you're going to pay a premium.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.840]   You can look at every single piece of technology that's ever come out.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.520]   And that's always going to be the case.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.000]   And if you don't have the tolerance for that, you shouldn't buy it.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.760]   We box with the big boys and we got our nose broken.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.760]   I mean, nobody's got a gun to your head to go on by this stuff.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.760]   Right, right.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.720]   You said you just don't want to be left behind.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.000]   You don't want to be left behind of all the cool people.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.640]   Which is exactly why nerd tax is the most appropriate.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   Exactly.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   I think they're right.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.240]   I can wait a little bit longer.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.760]   I've got to make sure I'll have this with me, life and the hey, hey, hey.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.880]   I do have to admit that there was something that I noticed in airport.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.520]   So I was in a lot of airports since I bought the iPhone.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.240]   And people who use iPhones, you almost feel like, well, I didn't feel it for other people,
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.600]   but they seem to feel it for me.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.880]   They just come over and ask me how it was going with my iPhone.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.560]   We pull out our iPhones and start looking at them and talking about them.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.600]   And everybody would be walking up to you, what do you think of the iPhone?
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.880]   So I think that there was definitely, I think people enjoyed that.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.440]   That's what you get for going in early.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.840]   No, I think there were a couple hundred bucks worth of bragging rights.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:25.200]   You got your two months worth of that and I think it's worth it.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   It's worth, it's worth, it's probably worth 200 bucks to finally have something that makes
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.920]   people want to talk to you.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   Exactly.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.480]   My imaginary girlfriend is so nice to me about it now.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.480]   I got it.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   She really is.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.640]   Her name's Charlene.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:45.480]   So any other thoughts about the fact that it's available in Europe now, it's official.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.840]   I like the name of the event, by the way, Mums, no longer the word.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.160]   It's so British, I say.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.240]   Mom, it's not long of the word.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   It's not an event.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   No, no, no.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.480]   Do we have dates on the other European markets?
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   We don't.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.320]   In fact, it looks like, I'm looking at the BBC story, it looks like they've only announced
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.880]   '02 in England.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.720]   So we don't even have confirmation that it's T-Mobile in Germany and Orange in France as
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.920]   we had heard.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.800]   But I can't imagine it'll be much longer.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.360]   And then I'm surprised we haven't seen anything in Asia, but it just sounds like they're just
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.280]   going to keep on slowly rolling it out all over the world over the next year and a half.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.960]   I think they've got to deal with this crack issue first.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.000]   I was going to say, how much do you think that affects their decision-making?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.080]   It's got to impact a lot.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.480]   If they can't stop the cracking, they've got no market.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.560]   Well, I mean, their carriers are going to certainly not give them the same deal.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.560]   I don't know what '02 said to Apple, but '02, I'm sure at some point when they sat down
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:47.320]   at the table, '02 said, "Well, apparently you don't have to buy it from the market."
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.680]   From us anymore, what are we going to do about that, Apple?
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   What are you going to do about it?
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.520]   Yeah, but I think there's always going to be the risk of when you buy something that's
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.880]   kind of hacked, there's always going to be that risk looming over you that it's not
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.880]   going to work somewhere down the road.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.600]   And I know that that would keep me from doing it.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.800]   I just don't have the time to deal with it not working.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.360]   So I would still, if today I knew that there was a hack available or I could buy the regular
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:17.160]   iPhone and just run it on AT&T, I'd probably still, no matter how much less my coverage
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:21.240]   is of AT&T than it was with Verizon, I probably still would do what I'm doing.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:25.160]   I mean, I don't think I'd want to have a hacked phone where I'm worried about the next
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.240]   time I sync it, it's not going to work.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   Oh, let's see.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.560]   Any other thoughts on that subject before we move on?
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.860]   Nothing.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.800]   You posted something called Amen Brother.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   What is this?
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   Is this for us?
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   Yeah, it is.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.240]   Well, I posted it, I think, both to the Twim List.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.200]   It was more to the Twim List than the Mac Breaklist.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.720]   But this is on YouTube.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:56.320]   It's not as much of a Mac thing, but if you like music or you're just kind of curious
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:03.760]   about the biography of music, it is a drumbeat from a single, I think it's a B side of a
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   sync on the 60s.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.880]   That's a great, that video is awesome.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   I've seen that.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.000]   And if you've heard this, it's 18 minutes of showing you where this drumbeat that started
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.040]   in the late 60s and how it became really popular in the rap era.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.600]   It's one 80 that everybody's using all the time.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.600]   And once you do it--
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:28.080]   There's certain beats like James Brown beats and stuff that you're really familiar to you.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.320]   And this is this one super obscure drumbeat.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.240]   And he goes through the whole all the substrata of where this has appeared over time.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.480]   And it's almost every watch.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   I mean, there's every member.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.480]   It's just never a recording.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.480]   You want to listen to it.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.480]   I mean, it's just on YouTube.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.360]   He has some kind of like just a record player going around and around and around.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.600]   But the point is, is when you listen to it, I played it in the background while I was
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.600]   getting ready this morning.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   And it was just this amazing tour of all of it.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.760]   And it's just really well produced.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.440]   He says it's the world's most important six second drum loop.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.680]   I'm trying to find the loop part.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.680]   He's talking right now.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   It's sort of purple.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.680]   It's been used so much.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.280]   Yeah, because somewhere in the middle it'll keep on playing it.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.280]   I'm already wondering.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   Oh, here it is.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.280]   I'm going to go back again and play it again.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   Good, good work.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:19.280]   Good part to play, right?
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.480]   I like this guy.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.280]   And then from 1990, just a little something from N.W.A.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.840]   This is like a guy you'd see in the high fidelity record store.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.920]   And then, you know, I can't hear this.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.240]   And I actually ended up at his website and he actually has a lot of other ones about
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:41.040]   music history and the history of Roland and the history of different things, which is
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   you know, I have a lot of stuff.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.320]   Okay, we'll put a link in that.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   And you can listen.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.320]   It's really worth listening to it.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   It's everywhere.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.280]   You know, like I mean recently, as soon as I heard it, I recognize that, oh, that's
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.560]   the drumbeat that I like so much from Lincoln Park's faint.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.320]   You know, it's that sample.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.320]   Right, cool.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.120]   And so it's everywhere.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.840]   Commercials, it's basically kind of the classic drum and bass drum beat.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.840]   You know, so anyway.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:10.840]   By the way, the system, the new iTunes, I didn't realize this blocked.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.800]   They call it accidental Linux use.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.120]   So you have to be one of the great like oxymorons accidental.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.440]   Oh, I didn't realize I didn't realize my computer had Linux on it.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.600]   It's stumbled into Linux by accident.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.240]   But apparently the Linux community responded within seconds.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:33.160]   This is so that you could use things like anapod or F pot or even Winamp to manage your
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.640]   music.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.920]   And I guess it broke the database file.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.280]   It changed the code.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.880]   But the Linux community quickly hacked it back.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.080]   So I think this is fascinating to watch this cat and mouse game that Apple's playing.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.000]   And I think Apple must be taking a lesson from this.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.160]   They haven't won yet.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.240]   I mean, it doesn't take long at all.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.840]   No, and they can't.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.320]   I mean, with any of this stuff, you know, you're fighting 12 year olds.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.320]   Right.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   So maybe not 12 year olds, even might be some pretty accomplished programmers.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:09.160]   But when something is as desirable as an iPod or an iPhone, you're just not going to win.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   Right.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.520]   And I really honestly think that they need to take a look at what happened in the satellite
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.640]   TV business, you know, where that kind of game was going on forever until finally they
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.120]   had to install hardware, you know, to say, no, you have to have a new card now and we're
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.040]   going to make it so that you have to burn a new e-prom or something if you get this to
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   work.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.040]   Right.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:34.080]   And I hope that that doesn't happen, that they are doing some kind of constant checksum
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.440]   on your iPhone or your iPod to make sure that it hasn't changed.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.880]   And when it does, it suddenly rips it out of there.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.280]   Maybe the way it goes.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.640]   The Apple's got a tough road a hoe because they've got to appeal, appease the phone company
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   in this case or the record companies in the case of iTunes and they're making these demands
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.640]   whether Apple wants to see to them or not, they still have to do it.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.600]   Well, I think what they've done, they've tried to do is pretty much what they did with the
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.000]   iPod where they just said, oh, yeah.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.040]   Our security is, oh, we're going to make this invisible and nobody will know.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.040]   Right.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.960]   And I think they hope they could get away with it the time and they can't.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.640]   You know, did you say that you had done all this stuff and then you did a restore and
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.520]   it still didn't, we would still, you could still do your monkey business with it?
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.480]   So, you know, that to me is intriguing because up till now, I think the main thing, I suspect
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.800]   that most of what most of us have thought is, well, they need to keep this thing locked
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.760]   up for a variety of, you know, business reasons because of their relationships with their,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:29.760]   you know, vendors.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.200]   But the other thing is just think about the unholy hell of support trying to deal with
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   people.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   I mean, how many times have you ever had to do support on your website for somebody who's
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   using Firefox?
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   Right.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   Oh, all the time.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.440]   You're like, no, it's because you have this thing installed and that's making your webpage
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   do this.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.440]   Right.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.440]   And you sure have to do that.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.800]   And I understand Apple not wanting to, but you know what?
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.600]   If you hack your phone to this degree, you'd be crazy to ask Apple for support.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.120]   I guess so, but yeah, but I mean, I guess what you're just, what you guys seem to be
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:01.400]   describing is a world where the markets are going to march ahead of Apple's own plans.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   Right.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.880]   And theoretically, then somebody's going to go out and buy one of these or give it as
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   they can.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   Well, that's true.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   You're right.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.880]   People are buying them who didn't do the hack.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.880]   You're right.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.320]   And so it's what, you know, it's like me and weeknies, you know, I'm never going to
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.240]   like call up direct TV and say, why is my Tivo messed up?
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   Right.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.000]   Because it's been Frankenstein beyond, you know, all belief.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.240]   But yeah, I just have to imagine that's got to be a, you know, a customer service nightmare
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.240]   for them.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:29.000]   It doesn't stop me from wanting to do it.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.280]   You know, I think that if you do it, you kind of have to understand that anything and
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.080]   any, and these, by the way, there's just climbers everywhere.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.560]   We don't know what's going to happen when I, there's an option.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.560]   Just be careful.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.800]   You don't do any accidental Linux use.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   That's what you're really doing.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   No accidental Linux use.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.560]   Well, I would say, has anybody heard of anybody actually breaking the phone after doing this
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.560]   stuff?
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.640]   I've heard people say they've brick the phone, but I know as far as I could tell, you really
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.840]   can't brick it because you can always do a restore.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.840]   That's what I found as well.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.400]   You know, I've been through the whole terminal hack stuff a few weeks ago when it was really
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.480]   ugly.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.720]   And I got into some, you know, hairy areas there where I had to back out and restore
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.240]   and I was always able to do it.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:12.400]   And I even tried running the latest installer app, app tap on my iPod touch to see what
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   that would.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.400]   Oh, what happened there?
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.080]   Oh, it's bad thing happened.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.680]   It got a couple of minutes in and said, this will take a couple of minutes and it took
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.520]   five minutes, 10 minutes, 12 minutes, I said, okay, it's not doing anything.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.560]   And I finally forced quit.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.080]   You're a brave man.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.400]   Yeah, well, you know, I didn't pick one.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   It's your job.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.400]   No, it's your job.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:43.240]   So it showed the police plug me into iTunes now and I tried and nothing changed.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.560]   Nothing so I did the forced restart.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.560]   Nothing changed.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:50.920]   I plugged it into another Mac and at that point, the other Mac said, oh, I know what
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.000]   you are and I was able to restore it from there.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.760]   So even then when I thought, oh, I am so in the soup, I was able to get through with
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   the restore.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.160]   Give it back to Apple say, I don't know what happened.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.400]   I keep seeing this icon here and there seems to be a copy of Linux on it.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.560]   I was accidental.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.640]   I was walking along with my bathroom was open.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.560]   I tripped and fell and I had Linux on my iPod.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.320]   It's one of those things as emergency room workers here all the time.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:23.800]   My bicycles were in the shower and I slipped and I did some accidental Linux.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.200]   Well, it's good.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.960]   Yeah, I think you probably, you know, as long as you can get a Mac to recognize it, it's
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.640]   not so messed up that the Mac can't see it.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.280]   You're always going to be able to do that to restore it.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.440]   I mean, I've kind of messed mine up.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.160]   Here's one little, here's one little tip.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:44.400]   If you run app tap, there's another application called RBT that you can use to rearrange the
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.400]   icons and change them.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.400]   And it's really nice.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.760]   You could totally arrange what your icons look like.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   You can hide.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.560]   If you don't use YouTube, you can hide it.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:59.600]   However, what you shouldn't do is then turn off the feature that lets you scroll.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.480]   The summer board lets you scroll because then you can't scroll down and change it.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.760]   So now I think I'm going to have to restore it because I can't actually change the changes
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.920]   because I can't get to that icon because it's below the dock now.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.840]   Yeah, and there's a danger of it going in through app tap and looking all that stuff
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.840]   there.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:21.040]   You can fill it all and you've got 17 launchers on there, all of which conflict with each
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.040]   other.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.800]   You've got to be a little careful.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   On the other hand, it's pretty neat.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.840]   I'll talk more about it as my software.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.320]   It is my pick, but there's nothing to say at this point.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.320]   I've said everything.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.960]   There were a couple of other things I thought about.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.680]   YouTube doesn't work initially after you do the hack, but it's very easy to get it back.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.400]   I got it working just fine.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.960]   There's some, you know, I think there's some bit that has to be set, believe it or not.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.240]   That's very trivial.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.880]   It just doesn't, it says, oh, you know, I'm not, you know, I can't go see YouTube.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.280]   Of course you do lose visual voicemail, but Apple is clearly planned for this phone to
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.040]   be used with other systems that don't support visual voicemail because it works like a normal
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.280]   cell phone where your phone icon has a red dot if there's a message waiting.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.320]   Sometimes that dock goes on more often than it ought to.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.160]   Apparently, there's a fix for that.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.680]   And finally, you can't use the special Yahoo iMap server that's set up for an iPhone.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   You have to just go through your standard pop account to your Yahoo.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.040]   It took me a while trying to get into Yahoo before I realized that.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.880]   So you don't have to push mail anymore.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.440]   But I mean, these are very minor things.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.400]   In most ways, it's exactly like the iPhone except that it says T-Mobile on it.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.560]   And if you're really committed to having T-Mobile or whatever, then that makes.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.520]   Well, I already have a T-Mobile account and it's, I've been forwarding the calls from T-Mobile
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:34.320]   to AT&T, which I'm sure is double costing me.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:39.920]   Hey, Leo, this is really way, way off what you're talking about, but you're getting pretty
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   geeky.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.680]   Maybe we could play, do an episode of Let's Pretend It's Seven Weeks ago.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.680]   Okay.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.880]   Do you want to play that game?
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.400]   Yeah, let me see if I can find it.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.880]   It's the game all America is playing.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.880]   It's called Let's Pretend It's Seven Weeks ago.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.200]   And it's a game where we act like, you know, because Merlin got his iPhone seven weeks
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.200]   after everyone else.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.640]   And he's just realizing cool stuff.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.640]   Yes.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.080]   I have, I would be happy to do a quick swag segment on some stuff I've landed on that I
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.080]   really like a lot.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.080]   Oh, good.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.080]   All right.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.960]   Well, let me, let me get my, we have to queue up the Let's Pretend It's seven weeks ago.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   Game show music.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.960]   Oh, excellent.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.840]   I think I believe, I believe I have that if I could just find it here.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.840]   Let's see.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.000]   Let's pretend it should be alphabetical, right?
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.840]   Let's pretend it's seven weeks ago.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.840]   Shoot.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.080]   I'll just edit this out.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.080]   Don't worry about it.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.080]   Okay.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.080]   Oh, that's, that's, yes.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.080]   Well, here we are once again.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:35.520]   It's time for a game that we like to call Let's Pretend It's seven weeks ago.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.520]   First of all, a case.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.520]   I got a case that I love.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.520]   Yes.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.480]   Because I haven't been able to find a perfect case.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.920]   All my nerd friends get the, the rubbery one.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.920]   That's what I have.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.920]   Okay.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.720]   It's the DLL Jam case because it has the very fine cord management solution.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   Yes, exactly.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   No, that's nice.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   But the problem is I'm a fat man who wears jeans and I would never be able to get back.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:56.720]   You can't give it.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   You can't give it.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.720]   I went with the case mate.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:03.200]   The case mate signature leather case is really cool.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.680]   It's very slim.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.400]   If you do, you might want to go Google on case mate signature.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.360]   Google sells them I think because they're very popular.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.800]   I had to go to the AT&T store to find one.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.880]   They sent me.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.320]   But I love this thing.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.120]   And I use it in combination with the, what's it called, the crystal film set, you know,
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.840]   the, the little plastic covering thing for the actual display.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.520]   Do you use that really?
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.960]   I do because I want to keep this nice and I don't want it to get all scratch.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.960]   You don't need it right.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.120]   Oh, and now it's time to play the game.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.800]   Let's pretend it's seven weeks ago.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.200]   And now here's your host, Marilyn Man.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.600]   And welcome this week to let's pretend it's seven weeks ago.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:44.160]   That was a little bit of a lag.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.760]   I think I accidentally had some Linux there.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   Sorry.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.560]   I think you had a little accidental Linux.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.400]   Well, I'm very excited about this case that I've gotten.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.800]   The case that I've gotten is by case mate.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.760]   Yes, I think we heard that part.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.920]   I have no idea what you're going to do.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   Jump ahead now.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.360]   I'm not going to edit this at all.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.960]   This is as a little joke.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.720]   Oh, joke live to tape is what we call it.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.200]   I love this thing and it's very slim.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.200]   It's very easy to get out.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.880]   Now you can put that really dorky screw on like I want this hanging on my belt thing
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:14.880]   that I don't like that.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.840]   That one sure you ever ever get laid.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.840]   Right.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.840]   I did not put that.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   No, don't do that.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.840]   But it's very slim and I like it a lot.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.120]   Now, Leo, I've been away for a while.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.520]   Did you get red pink, black, green?
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   I got black.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.600]   I got the Phantom black.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.600]   The signature black.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.880]   And it's good and it smells good and it's really nice and easy to use.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.800]   And it's got just enough kind of protection around the edges where if you dropped it,
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.520]   like it's not going to save your life, but it would definitely take the edge off.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.760]   Did you get the flip cover with it or no?
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.760]   No, not.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.760]   Okay.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.520]   No, that's a little too Star Trek for me.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:51.760]   I actually have the case made my second phone, my original iPhones in the case made.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   The legal one.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   The legal one.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.960]   The unhacked iPhone is in the case made.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.720]   Now, I don't know if you talked about this while I was gone, Leo, but have you talked
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.720]   about the what are they called?
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.720]   The Etymodix.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.720]   Have you talked about this?
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.480]   Do you know about the hackable headphones?
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.680]   Oh, yes, we did.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.640]   The site you go to we talked about last week.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   Did you do that?
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.640]   I'm a good friend, Matt Howie bought these and didn't like them.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.720]   So he gave them to me and I'm loving them.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:18.280]   So they take the Apple connector and Apple mic and they put it on your Etymodix earbuds.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   Exactly.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.880]   So you get the little with the little weird kind of triple dip thing on the top for sticking
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   in your ear.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.880]   And it's been working famously.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:31.320]   The part that continues to blow me away is that I use it, you know, as, you know, for
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.320]   hands free.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   I love it.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.120]   And it's apparently doesn't sound too bad.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.120]   People aren't complaining.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   Sounds great.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.120]   I use it all the time.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:42.200]   No, but they patch it into the cord or do they actually run it into the actual headphones?
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.120]   Do you see any kind of lump where they did the.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.560]   No, that's exactly what I was expecting.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.800]   But if you look at it, they must be opening up the actual.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.880]   That's your thing.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.600]   My sense is it white all the way up to the Etymodix.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   They open the ear.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   They put it into the Etymodix.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   Right.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   No, I don't think these are the super duper high end ones that you use.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   No, no, that's right.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   They use the lower end.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   These are six.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   Sixes.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.600]   Yeah, they use the sixes.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   But, but it sounds great.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   Don't they?
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.600]   Yeah, they're good.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   I'll try and think of anything else I've got here on let's pretend it's seven weeks ago.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.520]   Well, that was only one week old.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.760]   That wasn't too bad.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.520]   That wasn't too bad.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.800]   But yeah, but the case was a big one for me.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.320]   Like you, I wanted one that would be kind of cool.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.760]   And that concludes this edition of let's pretend it was seven weeks ago with your host,
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   Merlin Man.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.680]   Join us next week where we'll pretend it was six weeks ago.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.160]   Mark Goodman, Bill Todman, British.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.240]   This is Johnny Olsen speaking.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.240]   Mark Goodson.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.320]   Mark Goodson, Bill Todman, is that it?
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.320]   You got it.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.280]   You watched way too much game show TV in your youth.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.080]   Now, were you around back in the day?
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   You're a little too young for this.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.920]   You weren't around during the 21 scandal, right?
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.920]   That was before your death.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   No, no.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.520]   21 or $64,000.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:59.320]   I think it was Jack Barry in '21.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.320]   That was a later one.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   $64,000.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.320]   That was in the 50s or the Quiz Show scandals.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.960]   Yeah, that's before your time though, right?
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:13.280]   What movie begins with the it's a quiz kid?
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.280]   There's Quiz Show.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.240]   There's that John Tetero Ray Fines movie.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.720]   Yeah, that's a great movie.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.320]   That's a good movie.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:24.880]   So digging our way back out of this rat hole, Mark Cuban has gone Mac.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.880]   Does anybody care?
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   Yeah, that's just crazy.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:27.880]   But I don't really.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.600]   It's just crazy talk.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.800]   Crazy talk.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:37.080]   He bought Vista and it was so slow that he went out and got a copy of CPU magazine with
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:38.640]   the Vista tricks.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.040]   And then he said everything froze and crashed left often, but it's still a problem.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.040]   So he went out and got that.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.800]   The best part of this whole story though is in Gruber Link to it, this quote from Gruber.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   Did you catch this?
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   No, what did Gruber say?
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.720]   There's a whole class of recent switchers who define quote unquote "apple fanboy" as
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:57.160]   anyone who's been an enthusiastic Mac user since before I switched to the Mac.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.160]   Exactly.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.160]   I think that's dead truth.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:06.480]   Now, can you guys explain to me as the geeks that you are why Vista seems to be the line
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.280]   in the fan that I mean, were people waiting for XP and thinking, no, really, it's going
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   to get better.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.280]   And now it isn't.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.560]   And finally, I give up or I mean, why haven't they?
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.040]   Why didn't they give up two years ago?
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.040]   That's a good question.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.040]   I don't know.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.480]   Vista's no worse than XP was.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   So I don't know.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   I don't know what happened.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.480]   I guess I think that one of the things is that a lot of people are feeling safer with
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.000]   going to the Mac because they have an intel.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.640]   They can go back to Windows if they need to.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.520]   And I think that that's, I mean, I've talked to some people who would never consider just
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.960]   committing to it, but they felt like, well, I can use it as a PC if it doesn't, if I don't
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.960]   like the OS 10 interface.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.480]   And of course, that never actually happens.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:50.720]   You know, they run parallels so they can run their C apps and then they just slowly move
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:51.720]   over and then it's over.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.120]   Well, I think what's interesting about that is yes, we're seeing the geek start to do
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.960]   that because they understand that they can use them in cell machine and run Windows.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.400]   But sort of the great unwatched is no idea.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.040]   You know, I mean, time and again, you may tell them, they know really you can run Windows
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.920]   on this thing and go, what?
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:13.720]   But I think the fact that we're getting people in the media who are PC folks who are now starting
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:17.000]   to move over, maybe that will be some kind of trickle down where they, you know, maybe
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.760]   the message still won't get to them that yes, you can run Windows on here.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   But now that people they admire, say, no, really, the Mac OS is okay.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.880]   Perhaps then they think, well, yeah, and I don't want to jump to this anyway and I do
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.040]   need to buy new computers.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.440]   So maybe I'll give the Mac thing a try and somewhere along the line they discovered that
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.320]   they can run Windows.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.000]   Would you use VMware parallels now, Chris?
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.080]   I try to both, you know, and I'm comfortable with either one.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.560]   Yeah, I think they're very similar.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.360]   There are people who will want VMware because of the dual processor support and the better
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.880]   3D card support.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.640]   And when, you know, everybody says, oh, it's faster, but it's faster because of that multi
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   processor support.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   I don't think it's inherently faster.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.480]   Yeah, if I needed to do serious work, I just got a bootcamp.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   Right.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.480]   Right.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:06.080]   Yeah, we've had guys testing a lot of the stuff and even with like running soft demand
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.320]   exercise, which is about as hard, is going to hit the hardware about as hard as you can.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:16.000]   We found that parallels and we haven't didn't try it with VMware, but we did parallels worked
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   fairly well.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.320]   You know, we didn't hit it as hard as we could.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.320]   I tend to go back to bootcamp.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.280]   I'm going to go into a really big PC app, but I have to say, if you're not doing graphics
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:29.960]   on it, like really heavy duty graphics, I don't think there's any reason to go into bootcamp,
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   to be honest.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.440]   I mean, I think that one of these emulators is just fine.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.480]   I can't imagine you'd really notice the performance.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:43.920]   I'm seeing a lot of press these days, kind of defending NBC against Apple saying, you
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:49.000]   know, this is the latest kind of revisionist look at what happened with NBC and Apple.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:56.320]   And I guess NBC is still planning not to be on iTunes and move to Hulu and Amazon.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.320]   But something-
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.320]   That'll work real well.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   Yeah, I know.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.320]   I mean, I think that's crazy.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   That's cracked.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:03.520]   In fact, Fox, there was rumor that Fox would also make the move and Fox said, no, no, no,
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.360]   we're happy on iTunes.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.560]   But I can understand them wanting to price stuff the way they want to price it.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.360]   And Apple, you know, when Apple says, no, you price it the way we say, I could see how
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.000]   a business might feel like that's unfair.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.760]   And I would only argue that they haven't done anything that actually works and Apple has.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.160]   So they might want to take a little advice.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   It's impractical.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   Let's put it this way.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.000]   It's impractical to leave iTunes.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.160]   But it might not be.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.040]   I mean, I can understand from a business point of view, they just, you know, they want to
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.920]   have a little more flexibility in pricing.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:33.920]   Is that so bad?
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.120]   You think it's just they're trying to find something that's just plausible enough that
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:42.320]   they can, you know, be like, oh, well, Jimmy, Jimmy, the guy who sweeps up and says, you
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.680]   know, after everyone leaves, he'll go out with me.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   Right.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.960]   You know, you know, it seems like eventually you've got to come back to iTunes.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.160]   It just, it just seems sensible.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:55.360]   And if they do, Apple will be far less forgiving than they were the first time around.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:02.400]   I mean, you know, if Hulu or Hula or whatever it is and Amazon and all that stuff, it doesn't
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.400]   work.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.400]   I'm coming back to it.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.600]   I just can't imagine Steve really being nice about that.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:13.160]   Yeah, I, you know, but I think that these guys have seen sort of the, the world pool that
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.960]   the music industry has gone into, you know, and they're sort of standing off from the
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.400]   world pool and their ships and saying, well, we're not going to let that happen to us.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.360]   And they're starting to get sucked in.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.560]   And they're trying to get out.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.560]   And then they do sort of these things like, well, we won't be on iTunes anymore.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.560]   Okay.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.440]   Well, what are you going to do that was any better than what you did before?
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.200]   We're going to stream it with commercials.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   Right.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.800]   And now I know we're a bit torrid.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   So I'll just do that.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   That's the mistake.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.480]   And that's the thing Corey Dr. always points out is, you know, you got to remember people
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.880]   can get it for free.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.840]   Your, your real competition is not iTunes or some other thing.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.840]   It is bit torn.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   It's free.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.280]   There's a lot of people that I know that if they can't find it on iTunes, you know, as
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.760]   far as they're concerned, it's fair game.
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.760]   No, I'm going to go to the other side.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.880]   That same feeling sort of like I am willing to do it.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.120]   If I can do it through iTunes, I will get my subscription for such and such a season.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.120]   It's convenient for me.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.120]   Right.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.440]   If you make it inconvenient for me, I could people it, but I'm not going to.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.640]   I'm just going to go to bit for it.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.640]   Right.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.960]   Well, that's exactly what I've done with the office.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:18.400]   I bought up the first three seasons, perfectly willing to buy season four.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.520]   But if it's not available on iTunes, I can't use Hulu and I can't use because I'm a Mac
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.520]   user and I can't use Amazon.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:28.120]   And the thing is, is that once, even if you've got people excited about downloading this
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:32.400]   stuff, there may be a whole new set of people who weren't downloading before that will now,
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.080]   you know, because then especially on the Mac side, you know, and what you have to do
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:42.160]   is I mean, you know, especially with something like Heroes, I was paying for it or I could,
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.840]   you know, download HD versions for free.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.360]   You know, that's not even that it's parody.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.000]   I mean, the stuff you're downloading for free is higher quality than the stuff that we were
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   paying for.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.720]   I think everybody, well, this is probably a stupid thing to say, but I suspect everybody
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.880]   has their own little personal cascade.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.240]   You know, I think for where they choose to go and find things.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:05.600]   And let's be honest, going to Sam Goody is not on the cascade for most people.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   There's a certain number of places where you're going to check.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.680]   I was talking to somebody, I was talking to a friend of mine the day before last about
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:15.360]   how, you know, this is really embarrassing, but I have gone and bought stuff off of iTunes
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.200]   because I didn't want to go find the record in my basement.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.120]   I don't even touch CDs anymore.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:22.560]   It's just faster, you know, and now that of course there are other outlets that are even
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:27.400]   faster and cheaper than that, but I have gotten in the habit of buying things or obtaining
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.040]   things online.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:35.560]   And boy, again, this is a big rerun of ours, but just gosh, put a cash register on that.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:39.640]   You know, I don't know about you guys, but I'm spending more on iTunes than I ever have
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   before.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   Me too.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.640]   Me too.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   It's a point of access.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:46.440]   We want to watch, we want to get this weeds looks like a great show.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.680]   Let's buy a season of it.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.680]   You know, and...
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.440]   Yeah, I bought a lot of crap that way, actually.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:56.080]   And now that I have the Wi-Fi store on my iPod Touch, I just started up again.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.280]   There was a lull for a while over the weekend.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.920]   Did you use that at Starbucks?
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:03.720]   No, I didn't use the Starbucks, but it works now over Wi-Fi.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.720]   So you're buying stuff on your iPod.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.760]   I'm buying stuff on my iPod.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.600]   I have a cut from an Ethiopian artist that I'd heard, and I thought, "Oh, this sounds
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:13.600]   good."
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.840]   I previewed something on another album and went, "Okay, I'll buy that, and I'll buy this."
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.720]   It's a very smart model.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.560]   Make it easy, make it available, make it possible, frankly, to make an impulse purchase, and
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.560]   people will.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.480]   I wish they'd bring it to the Apple TV.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   I do too.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   I'm sure they will.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:33.560]   Well, that's the one that's crazy, is that you have it working on the iPod.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.840]   That's what you want to do with the Apple TV, and it's just so frustrating.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.840]   I'm sure that's coming.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.480]   What prompted this is an article in The New York Times by David Carr.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.200]   I'm going to see if I could channel David.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:47.160]   The title is Steve Jobs I Came, I Saw I Caved.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:53.720]   His point is that Apple is saying consumers want simple pricing except when it comes to
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.760]   their own products, and he quotes the recent price drop.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   He says, "I went into an Apple store, and the signs on the table were all wrong, and
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.920]   there's a guy a clerk standing next to it saying, 'The signs are wrong, the price just
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.040]   dropped by now.'"
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.080]   And he says, "Apple wants flexible pricing.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:15.360]   Why is it so difficult for them to accept that others might want the same thing on the
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:16.360]   iPad?
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:21.920]   I think that gets into where it becomes more complicated is when it is no longer that
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   flinch.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   Buying an iPhone…"
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.920]   Well, I don't know.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.600]   You could look at $4.99 on the store and make that decision.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.800]   Yeah, I just think that it would.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:33.240]   I think you'd sell more of the cheaper stuff and less of the more expensive stuff.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.240]   Oh, so what?
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.240]   I mean, that's NBC's decision, right?
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:38.240]   That's the problem.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.240]   Is there a technical reason?
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.520]   I don't think there's a technical reason.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.520]   You could have variable pricing on the iTunes store.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.880]   Yeah, I don't think there's any technical reason that you could.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.360]   No, and they would honestly do.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.680]   At one time they said, "Okay, all albums are going to be $9.99.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:51.680]   Well, they're not now."
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.680]   They're not, right?
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.680]   Right.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:55.680]   Right.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.960]   The car says eBay proved people will not only track prices closely but act in their own
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.880]   consuming self-interest.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.880]   The web can easily enable infinitely customized pricing.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.880]   Look at eBay.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.760]   I mean, that does make sense.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.840]   I'm not sure why Apple.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:15.760]   This is another, I think, another case of Steve's, you know, Jesuit point of view.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.440]   He's just made it up in his mind.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.440]   No buttons.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.680]   He's made it up in his mind.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:20.680]   No variable pricing.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.760]   I don't know if he's really thinking about…
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.880]   I should never say Steve's not thinking because he's clearly outfied me about a thousand
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.880]   times.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.920]   But I just wonder why he's so insistent on this.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.440]   Well, I mean, I have to admit, as a consumer, you know, the…
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   I would…
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.440]   Because the thing is, the price…
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   You can deal with it.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.440]   Come on, you just look at the price.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   The price would only go up.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.440]   They're not going to make them cheaper than $0.99.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.800]   A lot of that apparel, maybe they will.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.320]   In fact, one of the proposals the record companies said was, "We'd like to charge
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.240]   less for catalog and more for new."
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:56.800]   The issue is there's a transaction fee of 25 cents every single song.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:02.020]   You can't make it much cheaper unless you move out of using credit cards.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:07.400]   That's why, for instance, I haven't heard this from anyone, but my theory is, is why
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.120]   you don't get charged immediately.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.000]   Yeah, I heard that article right.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.440]   They're stacking up as many orders.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.240]   If you're a constant order, they'd rather run the charge when it's $10 or $20 or $30
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.920]   rather than $1 every single time.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.020]   They save a lot of money that way.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.200]   I think that the problem is that there's a floor.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.400]   99 cents is pretty close to that floor.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.880]   They can maybe drop it by 10 cents, but that's about a 10 or 15 cents.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:37.120]   When you look at that also, when we go back to thinking about the artist, which the RIA
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.040]   loves to bring up, there are already down the pennies.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.000]   The artist is already walking away with one of the things.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.840]   It's not the artist.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.080]   The only people making money in the iTunes store are the labels.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080]   Let's face that.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.820]   I mean, that's clear.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:55.660]   I still think, I mean, I think I've said this a thousand times, but I still think that the
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:59.980]   real revolution is the artist realizing they don't need the labels.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.580]   An Apple's building a pipeline.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:05.300]   I think that's something that they, if they're not afraid of, they should be.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.460]   I mean, you know, that that, you know, if Apple gets pushed too hard, they just stop
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.460]   making deal.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:12.740]   They don't stop, but they start making more and more deals with independent artists and
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.740]   independent producers.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.660]   We're not talking about like little, it's not like some guy in a garage band.
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.980]   We're talking about a lot of producers that are here in LA or in San Francisco or whatever
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.740]   that have worked on TV, that are tired of working on TV or think that there's a new business
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.980]   model and are producing TV quality kind of stuff.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.420]   There was a thing called quarter life.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:33.980]   Did you guys see this news about a show called quarter life that did a pilot and that was
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.980]   canceled?
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.740]   And now the guys have picked it up on MySpace.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:40.820]   You know, these are TV producers producing a TV show and putting it down.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.820]   There's a good one too.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.140]   There's the guys who did My So-called Life and 30-something.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:47.020]   It's interesting though, it's all about a blogger.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:50.780]   So it's got a very net focused point of view anyway.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:57.020]   So what you're really looking at is if that's a wall that if cracks start to form is much
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:04.140]   more problematic for the MPAA or the RA than any of these price arguments.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.980]   As long as we're quoting the New York Times, our third New York Times article, you should
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:08.980]   have read The Times this week.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.420]   It was great about Apple.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.340]   This is Randall Strauss writing.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.780]   He is a business professor at San Jose State University.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.540]   I just I love the opening paragraph.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:23.020]   If you're the owner of a Windows PC who's looking for a replacement computer, the choices
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.020]   are grim.
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:28.660]   You could step into the world of hurt that is Vista or you could seek out a new machine
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:32.380]   that still comes loaded with the comparatively ancient Windows XP.
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:36.060]   Maybe you might say the moments arrived to take a look at Mac.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:42.180]   And his point is that Apple has a very small closing fast window of opportunity.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:48.140]   He says once the once the Vista machine cranks up into full gear, it's going to be tough.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:50.340]   But now is the time for Apple.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.340]   You agree?
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.500]   Chris Bean, you think this is it?
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.500]   The Apple?
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   No, you disagree.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.340]   No, I think you start through that.
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:01.500]   You don't agree either, Alex?
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.500]   No, I mean, I don't think there's any kind of I think that Apple just Apple has yet to
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500]   capitalize on this.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.500]   I mean, if you look at the pure.
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.500]   I mean, they have to share.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:14.580]   And the 15% of the power books or 15% of the laptops out there are being sold are Macs.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.580]   17.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.580]   Yeah, 17% now.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:20.220]   So the thing and I think it's they're growing very fast.
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:25.260]   I mean, I don't think that I don't think Apple is designed to be a company that has
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.500]   50% of the market share, 60% of the market share.
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:32.180]   And that is to get to that market share is incredibly difficult because a lot of that
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:38.460]   it's including business computers and IT people who don't have any interest in moving over
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:44.020]   and it's not like they could just get all the home users and they'd be at 60%.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.500]   He says the problem is Apple's lack of retail presence.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.300]   And that's because nobody on the board is dedicated to the Mac.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:55.420]   There's somebody in charge of or the executive team is somebody in charge of I-Prod.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.460]   That's Mac's lack of retail presence.
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.300]   Except for all the Apple stores, right?
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.300]   Except for all the Apple stores.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.300]   But that's the only place.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.420]   I mean, if you go into any other store, you know, you can go say that sells them.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.020]   You know, there's a lot of Windows machines and in the corner, there's the Macs.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:12.940]   What are the name brands that they're selling in those stores?
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.580]   No, you're right.
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.500]   They sell Sony, they sell Toshiba.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:21.660]   Well, yeah, I mean, the thing is, yeah, it seems like you're, yeah, it's a weird kind
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:26.380]   of like not really fair fight to say Apple, one of the most strongly recognized brands
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:31.260]   in the world against all these Johnny No name, you know, because I mean, we're not talking
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:35.380]   about Dell's and I mean, what are the big names in PCs right now?
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.380]   Like who?
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.140]   I mean, nature's Dell, obviously.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:43.140]   There's a CompUSA that is a block away from the Apple store in San Francisco.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:47.700]   So it's a flagship Apple store and there's a CompUSA that is one block away.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:52.420]   This CompUSA has probably 800 square feet dedicated to Apple.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.100]   You know, now Sony.
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.460]   And the totally cherry part of the store, like where you first walk in.
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:01.660]   When you first walk in and then another section down below, you know, right when you come
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.660]   down the escalator.
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.940]   The first thing that you see when you walk when you come into CompUSA and it does very, very
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:12.460]   well, you know, you know, you know, that even with Apple, a block away, you know, which
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:16.420]   is insane, you know, and Sony, you know, they have their section in the store, which is
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:21.180]   the, you know, four by two feet that their two laptops are sitting on.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:24.820]   You know, they've got the Sony store at the Metreon though.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:25.820]   Right.
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.820]   But no, nevermind.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:27.820]   I mean, I guess you go and look there.
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:28.820]   I see people buying there.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:29.820]   You're like, what the heck?
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:33.140]   I mean, HP is the big name that's in the CompUSA.
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.500]   I didn't mean to sell them.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.260]   But HP doesn't have a dedicated rep.
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:42.380]   When you walk into an Apple store, and I think Apple does this well, I think that when you
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:48.180]   walk into an Apple section of CompUSA, there is someone there that actually knows how back
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.180]   it is.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.180]   All right.
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.900]   If you say this, then why is an Apple share growing faster?
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:56.100]   I mean, okay, admittedly, laptop share is growing, but desktop's not growing, is it?
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.100]   I think it is.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.100]   I think it's it.
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:00.700]   I think it's at six or seven or eight percent, which is quite affordable.
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.140]   No, it's down slightly.
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:05.900]   So it's down below three percent again.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.900]   Is it?
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:07.900]   Yeah, the last I saw.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:08.900]   I don't know.
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:13.260]   Now there's a problem with that because it does include business sales and includes sales
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:17.660]   outside the US, which frankly, Apple is not as much of a presence outside the US.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.140]   Yeah, but I mean, it's like competing.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.180]   I'm sorry, it sounds so dismissive because I don't know anything about any of this, but
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:25.220]   it seems like trying to compete with like fleet sales.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.220]   That's right.
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:32.900]   So if you took out an automobile sales, if you took out the sales that General Motors
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:37.340]   and Ford make to rental car companies, like what would their sales look like right now?
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:38.340]   No, absolutely.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.340]   Taurus would be number one.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.340]   And this is you're they're just coming in.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.260]   They're just I'm guessing they're just checking off a box and a whole bunch of this, this
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.020]   scored a bunch of computers into there.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.620]   And you know, I don't know, it just doesn't seem as it's a commodity.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.540]   It's a commodity product.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:56.180]   I mean, if you look at BMW keeps up the fast pace, BMW's market share for the first seven
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:58.500]   months was up to 7%.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.500]   Right.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.860]   You know, I mean, you know, so the thing is, is that you know, I don't think Apple's trying
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.020]   to cover the entire market.
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:08.420]   They're trying to cover a, you know, one segment of that market.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:11.020]   What is their domestic home market share?
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:15.060]   I mean, that's the one that really that's the number that really should matter, not business.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.060]   Good question.
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:20.860]   But I wonder I would bet there 30 or 40% in the home in the US.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:27.900]   But I think once again, if you cut it against individual users in the US, I think your percentages
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:28.900]   are much higher.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:33.740]   My, my anecdotal, you know, how many max I see, at least, and I know laptops are higher, but
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:39.100]   how many Macintosh as you see, you know, traveling or whatever is much higher than, you know,
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.100]   15%.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:44.540]   I mean, it's like half and most airports, you know, that I when I'm walking through,
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.420]   it's just the airports I'm going to.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.060]   But I mean, it's, you know, it's an awful lot.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.060]   Does Chris have a number on that?
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.060]   Do you happen to know that, Chris?
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.620]   I have to know number on that.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:54.660]   I'm desperately looking quickly on the net.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:55.660]   I don't see it.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:58.060]   Yeah, but I do agree with you, Marlon, that it's interesting.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.180]   It's interesting what people really use being versus what somebody forced to use that they're,
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.980]   you know, at the factory.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:04.980]   People are buying.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:07.940]   Yeah, or again, I mean, it's also you can, you can find lots of people out there that
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:11.900]   are still you doing Windows servers, you know, because that's what they've always bought.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:15.380]   And I think I realized that we're cutting this a little bit thin, but I think it would
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:19.160]   be kind of interesting to see what the sales would be on people who are paying out of
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.700]   their own pocket for computers.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.700]   Right.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:29.820]   Here's for 2006, US only the Mac sales fell a full percentage point to 5.1% of the US.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.740]   But again, this, nobody's breaking it out business versus home sales.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:39.460]   Yeah, and I think that laptop number is important because increasingly people are going with
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.940]   laptops rather than getting a desktop system.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.740]   My mind is you're going to buy a desktop.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:44.740]   Why?
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.460]   Well, like to me, there's, there's no competition here.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:50.180]   Like, if you're on the fence and you're thinking, Oh gosh, I know how to use Windows.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.180]   I've used to my whole life.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.460]   I can go buy this $35 tower machine.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.460]   That's the problem.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.340]   And $2,000 on a Mac.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:00.820]   I had somebody call me on the radio show and it was really, I had no response.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:07.820]   They said, you know, I'm looking at a Dell, a core two and a Mac book pro and comparably
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:08.820]   priced.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.020]   There's a $2,000 price difference.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:15.900]   I, you know, as much as I'd like to buy the Mac, is it worth $2,000 more?
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.900]   And I don't think you could say it.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:17.900]   I don't know.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.900]   Can you say it is?
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:19.900]   I don't know.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.940]   I think you, I mean, I think it is for me, obviously is for us.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.300]   But if that's still a question to you, then the answer is absolutely no.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:29.780]   I know that sounds like kind of stupid, like, you know, shopping malls in, but like if you
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:32.740]   still have a question in your mind, whether there's any comparison, you should definitely
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:33.740]   buy the PC.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.740]   No question.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.740]   Well, maybe you just don't know that about the difference.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.260]   Yeah, but see, that's what I'm saying.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:42.580]   Like it's part of, so for the longest time, even though I've used a Mac like all the time,
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:47.380]   almost, almost exclusively since 1987, it wasn't really until about the last three,
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:52.100]   four years since OS 10 matured that I've really felt good about saying to a garden variety
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.100]   users.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.780]   And this is something that you should use, you know, I think it's, it's still an easy
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:58.380]   default to just get windows.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:01.820]   Your stuff still theoretically works as badly or as well as it did before.
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.780]   And you save yourself a couple thousand bucks.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   That's the thing.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.860]   And if you can't taste the difference with the generic.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:14.500]   And that's true, but I have to admit that it's just, you know, I can't, I value my time.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:19.420]   It's all value your time to out as soon as I add value to my time.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:20.420]   That's a good point.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:23.700]   The $2,000 becomes really cheap, you know, because, you know, I look at it like kind
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:28.180]   of like I'm not, I don't want to, I don't want to worry about, you know, all the things
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:32.860]   that that we worry about related to my related to my one PC.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.540]   It causes enough trouble to make up for all the other Macs.
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.700]   I value, I value my joy.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:43.100]   I value the fact that I genuinely really, really am excited about using a Mac and it's
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:49.540]   the years that I was using a PC primarily for programming, you know, cold fusion on a PC.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.660]   Those were not joyful days for me.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.820]   It was like, could have had to do with a cold fusion too.
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:54.820]   I mean, it might not just be.
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.180]   Oh man, it was, it was just insult to injury.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.180]   Right.
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.740]   It's before I learned PHP.
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:00.740]   What can I say?
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:05.500]   But, uh, no, but it's, I don't, anyway, this is, this is such a, you know, what, this
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.580]   is one of those classic things I guess, you know?
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:08.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:13.740]   But it is, it is funny as, as people point out, it is kind of funny that people who are
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:18.260]   really like just crazy anti Mac, they get one and they use it and all of a sudden they're
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:19.260]   not so crazy anti Mac anymore.
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.940]   Well, I think they're not a fan boy.
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:28.660]   No, no, not only, yeah, those fan boys, those people who liked it two years ago.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:29.660]   Those guys are crazy.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.660]   I've been not wasting time for 20 years.
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:33.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:39.060]   You know, I think also when we look at between the laptop and the, in the desktops, I think
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:43.220]   that the only people that really need a desktop are gamers and graphics professionals.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.220]   I mean, I really don't think that there's anything else.
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:49.700]   If you're not doing one of those two things, I don't know what a desktop gives you that
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:50.700]   a laptop doesn't.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.740]   And I have to say, even though I have a MacBook Pro, I, the MacBook is the one that gets used
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:59.820]   the most because it's light, it's easy and it does 99% of what I want to do anyway.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.820]   Right.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:01.820]   Right.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.220]   So maybe, maybe it's just that's, that's maybe you're over buying anyway.
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:09.260]   Well, I think this is going to be a problem for, you know, a lot of, I think this is the
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:13.820]   problem for the PC industry in general is that there's no real reason to upgrade if you're
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.540]   not doing those two things, you know?
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:19.700]   And so the, you know, you can, you know, Excel is running as fast now as it ran, you know,
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.660]   five or six years ago, you know?
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.740]   And so that's the, that's the problem that you're going to get into and what, you know,
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.780]   what Apple's kind of, you know, what it rides the wave on is this idea that we're going
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:31.060]   to give you applications that require you to upgrade.
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:35.820]   I mean, you know, you look at GarageBand or the new Logic or the, you know, or any of
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:43.340]   the, even iMovie, you know, all of those things press the computer to do a lot more and require
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.820]   you to consider whether you need a new computer.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:50.980]   All right, gang, we're going to do our picks because the show's been getting longer and
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.500]   longer every week.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.100]   And I realize this because we discuss, discuss, discuss and then we do the picks.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.980]   So let's, let's interrupt this fine discussion and it has been a great discussion and get
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.140]   to our software picks.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:02.300]   I've already started mine.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.500]   So let me just finish up what I was saying.
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.460]   If you do have an iPhone and you want to jailbreak it or just want to add third party
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:15.460]   apps to it, clearly the best way to do it right now is nullriver's app tap at iphone.nullriver.com.
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:23.820]   I can't, you know, I realize it's risky to do this per tep, perhaps, although again,
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:26.460]   I think a restore is going to fix anything you've done.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:31.260]   You don't have, I'm not talking about necessarily unlocking the thing, although it's a first
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:35.580]   step to unlocking it, but just the wide variety of applications, couple of the, my favorite
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:40.580]   applications I'm using, it adds a voice recorder, a pretty capable voice recorder to the phone,
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.700]   something that was missing and turns out not to be such a difficult thing to do.
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:48.460]   You record, and I think it's a VMR format.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:54.100]   It's a format that QuickTime has no problems with, but it is not an MP3 or Wave.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:57.180]   Quality's not super great, but it's good enough.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:00.060]   It's called vNotes, and you can even email yourself.
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.940]   Let me just play back a vNote.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.140]   I don't know if you'll be able to hear how this sounds.
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:06.340]   Let's see.
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.340]   Cancel this.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.420]   You can also email them to yourself, which is really neat.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.420]   Cool.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:17.220]   It's speaking of emailing yourself, Sensong, Erika Sedan's, great application, allows you
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:22.300]   to email anything in your iPod playlist on the iPhone, but also take anything on the
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:25.940]   playlist and make it a ringtone, just by moving it over to the ringtone.
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:26.940]   Very slick.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:27.940]   To-do list app?
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:31.620]   There is a to-do list app, and it's fine.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:33.100]   It gets the job done.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.780]   It doesn't seem to sync with anything, and I think that's kind of a limitation.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.740]   Another limitation of the phone itself is you could, when you email your pictures from
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:43.740]   the iPhone, it reduces it to 640x480, which is very annoying.
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:48.420]   There's an application also, I think Erika's called SendPix that will send them in full
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:52.340]   format, so the full 2 megapixel pick gets sent out.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.620]   There's also a Flickr application that has one touch upload to Flickr, which is really
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:56.620]   nice.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:58.380]   It actually replaces the camera phone application.
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:59.380]   It goes on and on.
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.100]   There's dozens of them, even some pretty geeky ones.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.020]   There's games.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.780]   There's silly ones.
[01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.780]   It's a neat application.
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:11.500]   AppTap is its name, but you get it from iphone.norever.com/beta.
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:16.060]   It's free, and it has so far survived 742.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.420]   It survived restores.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.820]   It works pretty well, and I haven't had any problems with it.
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.060]   It's free.
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:23.660]   That's my pick.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:26.340]   Chris Brind, I didn't warn you, but do you have a pick for us?
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:29.420]   I do, because I'm going to pick you back on yours.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:33.380]   One application I'm going to ask you to look at once you do the apptap is Fropp.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.380]   Yes.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.380]   I love Fropp.
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:40.500]   Fropp is a Z-code interpreter that you can put on your iPhone, so you can play Zork and
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:46.460]   all those interactive fiction games that we played way back in the day when we didn't
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:50.820]   have those fancy pictures those kids today have.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:55.140]   It will improve your typing skills as well, because you spend a lot of time typing in
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:17:03.220]   commands like go look under the archisie and the iPhone response.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.220]   Anything?
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.860]   Look around the butt.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.220]   I really enjoy this.
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:13.220]   There's a new application, also part of the community sources, that is actually the first
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.740]   three Zork games all bundled together.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.220]   How did you get new Fropp games in there?
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:21.660]   There's an FTP site that has the interactive fiction.
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:28.260]   If you just Google FTP, I app for interactive fiction, you will find a long list of this
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:29.260]   stuff.
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:30.260]   How did you FTP them over?
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.700]   Did you get them on the desktop and then copy them?
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:38.220]   No, actually what I did is once I installed AppTap, I then installed OpenFSH.
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:43.100]   Once you do that, you can mount the phone via transmit.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:47.500]   And you get this pure FTP and you just drag this stuff over where you want it.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.500]   Excellent.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.500]   I have to do that.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.500]   I haven't done that yet.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.500]   Yeah, it's very easy.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.500]   And as I said, there is a new community sources which you should look at.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.540]   It just came out a couple of days ago that has all of the Zork games on it.
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.340]   Different interpreter, but the same idea.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:00.340]   Cool.
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:05.420]   F-R-O-T-Z, again, part of the Nell River iPhone package.
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:07.140]   Alex Lindsey, you got a pick for us?
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.140]   Yep.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.140]   I'm not piggybacking on you at all.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.420]   In fact, I'm going for an Alex pick.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.420]   It's about 1.5.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:13.420]   Alex.
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:14.420]   Ooh.
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:17.580]   So I was in dollars, ladies and gentlemen, for those of you.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.580]   At one point, yeah, one in the quarter.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:23.060]   It's 895.
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:25.660]   And this is a program called Moto.
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:31.020]   Moto is a new version that just got released, 301, I guess.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.100]   And this is from a company called Luxology.
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:36.780]   And what it is, is it's a modeler that just keeps on adding new things.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:39.140]   So 3D modeling tends to be known.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:43.540]   Everybody has a lot of 3D programs have.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.900]   Their program is kind of like a department store.
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:46.900]   You've got modeling.
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:47.900]   You've got animation.
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.900]   So you have to build the objects.
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.620]   You have to put textures on them, or make them give them surfaces.
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.060]   You have to create the lighting.
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:58.740]   You have to animate them, and building all those tools can take a long time.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:04.260]   What Moto is, is really primarily just designed to build the objects, put some surfaces on
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:07.660]   them, do some simple animation, and do some great rendering.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:12.060]   And because they've stayed really focused on that, and these guys have a lot of experience,
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.220]   it's probably the cleanest modeler out there.
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:18.500]   So if you want to build 3D objects, and there's a demo there, you can download and check it
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.700]   out.
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.460]   But it also runs really, really well on the Mac.
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:28.020]   It is cross-platform, but it's just a really, really nice interface.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.700]   And as I said, we use a lot of different things.
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:34.140]   We use Cinema 4D for a lot of our general stuff.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.780]   We use soft homage on the PC.
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:42.780]   But when it comes to modeling, I've really started to do more and more just in Moto.
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:48.940]   And it's just a really, really great application for those listening that are really into 3D.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:49.940]   Cool.
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:53.220]   Finally, last but not least, Merlin Mann.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:57.500]   As you know, Leo, I am incredibly baked on cold medicine right now.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.020]   So I may need your guidance.
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.420]   Have we done Acorn already?
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.420]   I don't believe so.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:03.060]   It doesn't ring a bell.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.980]   By flying meat, I did not do Acorn.
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:06.820]   We have done no flying meat programs.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:07.820]   Did you do it?
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:08.820]   I downloaded it, but I didn't actually.
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:12.260]   Oh, no, no, I don't think I mentioned it, but I haven't actually gotten to play with
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.260]   it yet.
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.260]   Well, then let's talk about it.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:15.260]   What is Acorn?
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.260]   Yes, Mueller.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.500]   I think actually, I feel like I must have mentioned this already.
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.900]   I'll just mention it very quickly and then maybe do a little one.
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:24.020]   But if you haven't tried it, haven't tried Acorn yet, do give it a try.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.900]   It's by flyingmeat, flyingmeat.com.
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.500]   And it's a very simple strip down.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.780]   I would say it's a Photoshop replacement for Photoshop.
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.780]   It's Photoshop for the rest of us.
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.580]   Let me put it that way.
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.740]   Very simple subset of commands.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:40.860]   Really, it's almost like Markdown for images.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.780]   Simp, super simple, one little tool palette for doing all your stuff.
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:45.660]   I'm almost certain that I've done this one before.
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.660]   I don't know.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.100]   I've done MBW picks of the week.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.620]   Let me go to MBW picks and see.
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:50.620]   I don't think it happens.
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:51.620]   I have any--
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:54.220]   Oh, in that case, in that case, let me rhapsodize.
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:59.380]   OK, so we've talked before about stuff like Sketch and how awesome Sketch is for doing screenshots.
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:01.460]   Because increasingly, this is the way we communicate with each other.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:02.980]   We take screenshots, and we send it to each other.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:06.580]   We post it on Flickr in defiance of their terms of service.
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:11.940]   But we-- you know, communication is becoming much more visual for a lot of us.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:16.220]   Now, the thing is, you want to do little bits of stuff to digital photos or to simple
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.220]   graphics.
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:22.020]   You've got to fire up this bajillion-dollar program to go in and like fix levels and
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:23.500]   unsharp mask, right?
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:25.380]   And it's a huge pain in the butt.
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:30.340]   To the rescue comes, Boyjini's Gus Mueller with a program called Acorn, which just came
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:32.140]   out a few weeks ago.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:36.500]   And this is a very simple-- it's flyingmeat.com/acorn.
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:39.260]   Very stripped-down interface for dealing with your images.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:40.260]   That said, it's very powerful.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:42.180]   I know, you did fly gesture.
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.180]   That's what you did.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:44.180]   Ah, I did fly gesture.
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.180]   That's another good one.
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:47.980]   But this is-- I guess I would just say go and have a look at this.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:50.060]   It's got a demo you can download.
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:54.780]   I'm finding it very easy in terms of just having a super fast opening application that
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.420]   just does the stuff that I need to do to most of my images.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.620]   And it's all the stuff that the palette-- it's got a single palette for move, select,
[01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:03.860]   draw, erase, fill gradients, so on.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:08.420]   All the stuff that you've become familiar with but exhausted by in Photoshop is right
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:09.420]   in here.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.100]   And it's integrated with stuff like, well, integrated.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:14.060]   It's got a link to Flickr uploader, for example.
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:20.740]   So what I do a lot is I'll do basic messing around in iPhoto, open it in Acorn, say, edit
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:23.620]   an external application to open it in Acorn.
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:27.220]   And then I'll just send it right to Flickr uploader from Acorn.
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:32.060]   So anyway, it's a nice little introductory price is $39.95, which is like what?
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:36.060]   Like 150th of what Photoshop are you looking at at, Alex?
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.780]   Oh, it's cool.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:38.780]   It's got layers.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:39.780]   Which is neat.
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:40.780]   So well, it's got layers.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:44.020]   And it's a little like, I mean, this is-- I don't know if they're used.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:46.140]   I mean, I'm using a lot of the core image stuff, but it does seem like we're getting
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.700]   more and more of these applications on the Mac where you get a bunch of these little
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:49.700]   things.
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:50.700]   G.P.U.
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.700]   Power.
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:52.700]   I know that kind of thing interests you.
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:53.700]   Right.
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.460]   Well, one of the things that's interesting about that is it means that your plugins happen
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:56.460]   immediately.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:59.380]   So while you're working on them with Photoshop, you get those little blocks that go all the
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.620]   way across when you apply the plugin.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.780]   And here, you're really getting a real-time performance.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:09.500]   The other thing that I thought was really-- that I think is interesting is did you see
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:13.820]   this-- when you apply the filters, you can actually apply a group of filters one after
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:14.820]   another.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:15.820]   Wow.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.700]   So it's almost an automator where you can add filters and chain them together.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:21.300]   Yeah, which is-- Ooh, this is pretty.
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.820]   That's a really great idea.
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:28.100]   And so it's a pretty nifty little application.
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:29.100]   Yeah, it does.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.100]   Apparently, it does screen grabs, too.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:31.100]   I didn't know that.
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.100]   I've still been using Sketch.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.100]   I still love Sketch.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:36.620]   But this, apparently, you can do screen grabs with Acorn as well.
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.540]   So it could be all in one little package.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:41.900]   And I mean, obviously, it's not going to be a quote-unquote replacement for Photoshop,
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:45.860]   but Photoshop has got to be one of the most notorious, like way beyond 80/20 applications
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:46.860]   ever.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:49.340]   There's like seven things I use in Photoshop.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:54.260]   And this one's the price is right, and it's got a lot of good stuff in it.
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:57.460]   Yeah, I think Photoshop really is aimed at the professional.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:00.180]   And I think that for us, I mean, we use it a lot.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.940]   None of these would really be a solution for that.
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:06.900]   But I think that for definitely for the average person who wants to do just some image editing,
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:13.300]   these new GPU/core image applications, I think, are just incredible.
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:15.940]   It's got resizing all of the basic things.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:22.380]   All the stuff, as Berlin said, 95% of what the average user would want is probably, you
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.380]   know, here.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.380]   That's impressive.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.380]   Look at all the effects.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:27.380]   And the effects are kind of geeky.
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:28.380]   The effects are kind of geeky.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.340]   You know, so there's a lot of the stuff that Photoshop has there.
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:35.060]   And then you go into like high dynamic range, and you'll see source A top and, you know,
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:39.940]   those minimum maximums, I'm assuming are floating point, which means that, you know,
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.780]   they're having some fun with that.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:42.780]   So,
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.780]   Unsharp Mask.
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:44.780]   I mean, this is pretty amazing.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.780]   Wow.
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:48.740]   If you're, I would say, for example, like if you're doing stuff which is noodling around
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:53.260]   on your computer, or you're doing basic fixes on your digital photos, I've got to think
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:57.020]   this is more than enough firepower for the average digital photo user.
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:00.580]   But does it have goo so that my plastic surgery can use it?
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.580]   That's...
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:05.580]   I'm going to remove your jowls and pull up the sides.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.580]   Look at this.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:07.580]   It's so beautiful.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.060]   You're looking like a woman now.
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:12.580]   Well, especially what's interesting about the core image stuff, and this is how Apple,
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:16.300]   you know, can kind of create a Photoshop without actually creating it, is what's interesting
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:20.460]   is that as Apple improves the tools that are available in core image, a lot of these little
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:22.500]   applications are just going to get better.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.620]   What's also an interesting strategy, don't create a Photoshop.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:30.380]   Just give, let a thousand flowers bloom, give them the tools to make it easy to create
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:33.700]   clones and then you don't even have to worry.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:38.060]   Yeah, and Adobe can't say anything because well, you didn't actually go into competition
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:39.060]   with them.
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:43.260]   And I don't think that any of these are real competition to Photoshop, but I think that
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:44.260]   there is this...
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.260]   I think they definitely are competition to a moment.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:46.260]   I think they're competition.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.260]   I don't think they're replacements.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.260]   I think they're competition.
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:52.820]   I think they make a big difference on the elements, Brown.
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:53.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:54.820]   Do they still sell them?
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:55.820]   It's brown.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.260]   He said dismissively.
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:58.460]   Those people might like it.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:25:59.700]   No, no, no, no.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.620]   But I think that elements fill the same issue.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.780]   And I think that elements might be a little overpriced.
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:07.420]   Pixelmators own its second beta, by the way, getting better and better.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.420]   Yeah, it is.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:09.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:10.420]   Yummy.
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.420]   Errr, er, good.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.420]   I have not seen...
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.620]   Well, we can get you in on that.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.620]   We have friends.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.620]   You're a friend.
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:17.620]   We have friends.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:19.620]   All right, we're going to wrap this up.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:21.300]   Thank you very much, Chris Breen, for joining us.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:25.060]   I'm sorry about all the technical, the SNE foods, but you came through loud and clear once we
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:26.500]   got you on the phone and I thank you.
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:27.740]   Yeah, you're very welcome.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.740]   I like this phone.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.060]   Yeah, we just use this phone thing.
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.060]   I don't know.
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.060]   Yeah, it's very clever.
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.060]   Here's clever.
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.340]   You can Mac 911, of course, is in the Macworld magazine.
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:36.500]   You can hear them on the Apple phone show.
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:37.820]   Anywhere else you'd like to have plugged?
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:40.340]   Are you performing at a holiday in anywhere soon?
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:45.020]   Not right away, but I've got an iPhone book coming out, like everybody else in the world.
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:48.420]   And I'll be updating my iPod and iTunes Pocket Guide very shortly.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:51.740]   Now will you cover hacking in the iPhone book?
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:55.140]   There is a little bit there, but because it changes so rapidly, we've actually been
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:57.740]   long and I've set up a website about hacking.
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.740]   So we're just going to send people there and we'll keep it updated.
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.140]   And what's that site?
[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:02.940]   It's going to be geeklegoon.com.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.620]   Oh, that's great.
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:05.620]   I love Ben.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:06.620]   So that's neat.
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.740]   Like we should get Ben on the show at some point.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.020]   In fact, you should get him on Twim because he really is.
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.020]   I mean, he's great.
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.020]   We're really good.
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.860]   Yeah, great for Tonya for a very talented one.
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:18.100]   What is next on Twim?
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:22.300]   Next on Twim, we are going to be doing that on Thursday and we're going to be talking
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.940]   about, you know, a lot of things.
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:29.220]   One of the big things that's coming up right now is the writer strike next year and we're
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:31.860]   going to talk about how it's impacting filmmaking today.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:34.340]   So that's going to be probably one of the larger issues that we're talking about.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:39.140]   And then just a lot of the day to day, what's coming up and what's happening in the media
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:40.140]   industry.
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:44.820]   Another great Pixelcore podcast you can catch at pixelcore.tv and of course, pixelcore.com
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:50.060]   if you want to find out more about Alex's day job, the great guild of multimedia artists.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:51.460]   Really, really neat thing.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:55.980]   pixelcore.com Merlin Mann is in hiatus with the Merlin show.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.260]   I'm basically Leo.
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:01.260]   I'm neglecting every conceivable part of my life right now.
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:03.820]   I'm finding new things to neglect.
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:09.540]   Partly in the service of trying to relaunch 43 folders with a new look and a new CMS,
[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:12.260]   which God willing should be happening pretty soon.
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:16.500]   But yeah, I got a lot of balls in the air, but I promise I'm going to get back to all
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.500]   of it really soon.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.660]   I'm going over this.
[01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:24.060]   This is the mildly added, but still fascinating and full of bloopers version of Mac break weekly.
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:25.820]   We thank everybody for joining us.
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:28.580]   We'll be back next week with who knows what.
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:30.300]   Well, we'll see you then.
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.900]   Another Mac break is broke.
