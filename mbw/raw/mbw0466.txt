[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.120]   Hey, hey.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.120]   Nice to see you.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.120]   It's good to be here.

[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.600]   Alex looks so perfect every week.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   It's unbelievable.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   I know.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.120]   But what he doesn't have...
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.960]   It sounds a little like the Wizard of Oz.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.960]   Is it brain?
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.960]   No.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.960]   What he doesn't have.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   Is Georgia Dao's beautiful little accent panels?
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   We have to get him some of those.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   I'm very plain.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.960]   Yeah, Georgia does this cool thing.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.960]   She has like...
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960]   I don't know what it is, like a white hue strips.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.960]   Yeah, the hue strips.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.600]   And then she has a canvas like you'd buy in the store, pre-stretch canvas.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.240]   And she puts LED strips behind it and so it glows under the edge.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.960]   And it just gives it like this little...
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   It's coming to you from the Matrix or the Grid or something.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   Oh, that's clever.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   That is quite nice, I must say.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   A Mosse?
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   Yes.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   Let's say...
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.960]   Maybe my next video.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   Plus, she's Georgia now.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   I mean, it's hard to compete.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   It doesn't hurt that she's Georgia Dao.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   And Andy Naco from somewhere in New England.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   Good to see you.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   Uh, hello, Leo.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.960]   He's probably in some town that's pronounced nothing like it's spelled like Wista or Gloucester.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.960]   Wista, Leimenstah.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960]   Leimenstah.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   Leimenstah is the worst.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   Well, you know, but if you're going to get to Lowell, you've got to go to Leimenstah first.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   How many times have I said that?
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   Uh, there isn't a whole lot.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   It's got a double head of this weekend.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   Ha, ha, ha.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   Gotta go to Fenway.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   We got, uh, not a lot of news because...
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.960]   It's August.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   And, uh, we all are waiting with Bated Breath to see what September and perhaps even October
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   and then the last few weeks of the week, we've got a couple of new things.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   We've got a couple of new things to do.

[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.960]   We've got a couple of new things to do.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   We're going to be open source and anybody can use this.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   That's what happens.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   Then you get the toxic health too.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   The teamwork phone.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.960]   What's wrong with that? That's the side effect of that.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   The other way to go, Apple's highly proprietary system.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   It's nice to have both.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960]   There is a side effect.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.960]   By the way, we will talk a little later about
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   how even a highly proprietary operating system
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.960]   can have serious security issues.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   Go ahead.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.960]   I'm still wondering what happens when that.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.960]   Now that we're in the realm where carriers,
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.960]   at least in the US, are no longer really able to trick people
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.960]   into thinking that their $200 phone is actually $200 phone.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   Now that they're explicitly saying,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.960]   "This is an $800 to $900 phone.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   We're just going to let you pay for it over two years."
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   I'm wondering what happens when people start seeing that difference.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   Now they're in the position of saying,
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.960]   "Here is the Motorola G phone that costs 25% as much.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.960]   Is it 25% as good or is it 90% or 95% as good?"
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.960]   I think that's what happens when people learn the actual price of a phone,
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   is that Motorola, one plus and others,
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   start making $300, $400 phones.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   Actually, I think you could say the one plus two,
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.960]   which is going to be about $400,
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.960]   is comparable to any $700 phone.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.960]   Does this put pressure on Apple or no?
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   We see resellers.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   I'm more of the time now.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.960]   We see people who buy the new phone then sell it
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   a couple of weeks before they predict the next one will be released.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   They get a high enough price that it only costs them two or $300 to buy the next big phone.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   There's various angles to this.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   The carrier is rebiphones now,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   and then they resell them in third world market or emerging markets.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.960]   But T-Mobile is doing basically an iPhone costs you 15 bucks a month,
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.960]   and you'll always have the latest iPhone.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   That's the new thing, right?
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.960]   Randy is right and the prices are in front of us now,
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   but people are really good at hacking those sorts of things
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   and they're coming up with all sorts of novel solutions to get what they want when they want it.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   That's the same reason.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   There are people who, like,
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.960]   whenever ease of use problems there might be with Android,
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   they solve those problems too.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   I love the fact that I'm with Renea.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.960]   I'm glad that there are so many different opportunities out there.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.960]   I wish that there were a company saying,
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   "You know what? We're going to make a weird, round phone."
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.960]   It is just the size of a ping-pong ball.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   It's mostly control services. It has one LED.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   Make it crazy and just let it find the 4,000 people
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   who are going to absolutely love it,
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.960]   because without that sort of differentiation,
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   really, Android benefits from the iPhone being there,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.960]   iPhone absolutely benefits from Android being there,
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   because if you have one king of the country that rules everything,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.960]   you're not encouraging that person to learn and adapt it,
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.960]   evolve and improve.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.960]   And I would argue--
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   Go ahead.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.960]   I was going to say, I think the next generation is going to be getting away
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.960]   from any kind of hardware device that isn't--
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.960]   you know, as the more I use my watch,
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.960]   the more I see that what you're really moving towards is this kind of embedded,
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   some way embedded wearable kind of environment
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   where you're not really picking up a phone very often.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   I would submit we do live in a pretty creative,
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   interesting time for phones.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.960]   I do think that because Android is freely available and free,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   it's a little Android heavy. Here's the Turing phone,
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   which is, I'm sure, based on Android, right, Jason?
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   Yeah, it is.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   Built out of liquid metal, it is ugly ass,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   but you could pre-order it now, and I mean, is that not ugly ass?
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   Am I wrong?
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   No, that's cool.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   Do you like that?
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   It's made out of liquid morphium.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.960]   Unobtanium.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.960]   Unobtanium.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.960]   I like the sharp edges.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.960]   That's going to make it fun to drop on your foot.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.960]   With liquid, you're from Terminator 2, Leo.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   I'm losing track of that.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   This is-- well, Apple has actually-- does Apple not own liquid metal?
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   Commercial usage rights to liquid metal.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   Yeah, so they claim this is liquid metal,
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   but obviously it can't be exactly--
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   It's like chocolatey.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   It says it's--
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   Liquid morphium is an amorphous liquid metal alloy tougher than titanium or steel.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   And of course, this phone is all about privacy,
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   as a number of other phones have been as well.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   This is the ultimate insecurity.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.960]   You can order it now.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.960]   I would wait.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   I think this is another one.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.960]   You know, it's from Turing Robotic Industries.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   This is a 3D render, my friends.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.960]   There's many a slip between the 3D renders.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   It doesn't go on a cal your networks.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   It's 100% secure.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   And then don't forget Project Era,
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   which was acquired by Google in the Motorola acquisition.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   They sold back Motorola, but they didn't sell back Era.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   And this is a modular phone, which I think is very interesting.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.960]   And it's about to be sold in-- if it's not already being sold in Puerto Rico,
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   it's about to be sold in Puerto Rico.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   Whether I want it or not, I'm happy that it interests.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.960]   Yeah, I don't want it because I feel like if I drop it,
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   it'll go boing and all the pieces will fly.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   It's like the last Iron Man movie,
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.960]   whenever Tony Stark tripped,
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960]   the all the armor fell off of them,
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   so you kind of wondered how effective the armor was.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.960]   It's like, Ma's trap.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   That's how these things work.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   I mean, the idea of a 6-inch phone or even a 5-inch phone is absolutely ridiculous.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   And you see them.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.960]   Oh, my God, that's totally stupid.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.960]   Right.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   Until you start to see them for two or three months
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   and you realize that, oh, it would kind of be nice to be able to read the whole comic strip
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   in one screen.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.960]   And then suddenly that's why they start to filter everywhere else.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.960]   Do you even a gold phone?
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   No, everyone thought a gold phone was ugly,
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   and then when they were sold out, people lost their minds.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   Oh, I love the gold phone.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   I love the guy.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.960]   Hey, can I say that the best Mac product of the year is not the phone?
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.960]   It's the Mac book.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.960]   We're speaking of it.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   I may be the only one who feels this way, but I love the Mac book.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   It's fantastic.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   Do you -- I would agree with you.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   I think it's the most exciting Mac that Apple has done.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.960]   It's certainly one of the three most exciting Macs that Apple has.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.960]   It's so forward thinking.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.960]   It goes for a really specific aesthetic.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   It has a very specific point of view and where it makes compromises for that point of view,
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   it tries to soften them as much as possible.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.960]   In the past, we have seen Apple do some things where it's like, we wanted this keyboard
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   to be banana-shaped.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.960]   The only way to do that was to only have 14 characters on the keyboard.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.960]   So that's what we did.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   It only has 14 characters on it.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   It's like, okay, thank you.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   It's a beautifully designed banana-shaped keyboard that I now absolutely can't use at all.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.960]   With a new Mac book, every time they've cut something out, they say, well, here's the reason.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   We're something we did to accommodate you knowing that it's going to be a bummer to have a flatter keyboard.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   We're going to redesign a new key switch so that it actually makes up for that a little bit.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   It's really, it's really, totally exciting.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   I don't know if they've -- I think if there's one flaw in the Mac book, it's that.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   The low travel on the keyboard.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   You've got to get -- it's one thing you're either going to use to it or you're not.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.960]   Most of the other problems here are either self-solving like the problem of having that one USB-C.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   Oh, I've bought every USB-C dongle.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.960]   And I love it.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   I'm happy.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   You might have never even done it.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   It's what's funny is I rarely use it.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.960]   Even my MacBook Pro and quote is dongle central.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   So that's not as big a problem.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.960]   The big problem was not being able to get them in the first couple of months.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   Those USB-C adapters.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.960]   But that's a self-solving problem.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   The CPU to a degree is a self-solving problem, particularly because no one's buying the super
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.960]   ultra-thin, ultra-light machine to do Final Cut 4K movie editing.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.960]   It's certainly capable for what you want to do.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.960]   Also, it makes you think about, oh, is there going to be an arm chip in here or two or three?
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.960]   It's also super cool because moving -- doing the force press -- sorry, the force press touchpad,
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.960]   it's a kind of a cool technology now that makes you think physics are a lie and your fingers
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   are a bunch of liars and all those kinds of things.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   But it also removes another mechanism.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.960]   In a traditional trackpad, you have to have all that vertically stacked on top of each other.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.960]   But with a digital mechanism, you can have the logic that supports that anywhere where
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.960]   there's room in the machine.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   And they no longer need the vertical height underneath the trackpad, which makes it thinner,
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.960]   or gives you more space for battery.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.960]   And all these things sort of lead you to whatever the MacBook is going to be next.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   And it reduces the mechanical parts, the things you can damage by dropping it, things that can
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.960]   mechanically fail.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   And all these things, I think, to Andy's point are incredibly forward thinking.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.960]   I love that machine.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.960]   And I'd love to see how it turns out for the pros.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.960]   You know, being someone who has a lot of retinas.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.960]   Well, I know a lot of people are saying, "I'm going to wait for the next MacBook because
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   it's certainly going to be faster, better."
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   You know, they'll need the sky.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   Well, like the 2011 MacBook Air versus the '28 MacBook Air.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   Right.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.960]   But I thought that was different because the 2011 -- the first MacBook Air that was -- sorry,
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.960]   not the '20' but the 2008 MacBook Air was really un-baked.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.960]   Really ungodly painful to use in every single way.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.960]   This was the idea.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.960]   We just wanted to build something in this shape.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   We don't care if it's only the shape of a computer and not an actual functioning computer.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   This is something where -- this is something -- the new MacBook is more like, we accept
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   that it's not going to be for everybody and some people are going to want to -- most people
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   are going to probably want to wait a year or two for the rest of the world to catch up
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   with the things that make this design practical.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   But for the people that this fits for, for the people who find themselves traveling with
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.960]   an iPad and a whole bunch of accessories to make it work like a notebook and then not being
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.960]   happy because it's not working really well as a notebook, those people are absolutely thrilled
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.960]   off their butts for this machine, I think.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   Let's take a break because I want to come back and talk about maybe what the next generation
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.960]   MacBook would be and Skylake, which is the new Intel processor.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   Ryan Shroud had a scoop on PC perspective, a leaked packaging for Skylake.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.960]   I think we're close.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.960]   Some are speculating that Skylake will be kind of the heart of a new MacBook.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   Let's take a break and maybe Renee, I'm sure you're up on this.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.960]   You can explain to us what does Skylake do for us and if it's in the offing for Apple.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   All about MVNO's Leo.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.960]   Skylake is all about it.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   That's roomy.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.960]   Okay.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   I don't know what that means, but I'll find out.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.960]   It's the tick, not the talk.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   We're down to 14 animators with Broadwell, but now Skylake is going to be a same 14-nanometer
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.960]   process but improved performance.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.960]   We'll talk about that though.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   Hold on.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   First, how are you going to get all those new gadgets?
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.960]   I think you mentioned it.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   One of you mentioned it.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.240]   I think Alex, that there's always the people who wait until the almost end of life of the
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.480]   old gadget, sell it and now they're ready for the new gadget.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.200]   That's actually a very smart strategy.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.160]   And may I give you a partner in that strategy?
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:59.880]   gazelle.com, the easy way to get a great deal when you sell and when you buy.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.760]   Now let me tell you first of all about selling.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.960]   gazelle, if you go there right now, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com will give you a 30-day guaranteed
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.680]   locked in, quote, that by the way is a huge advantage right there because especially as
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.280]   we get to the end of the life cycle for any device like let's say the iPhone 6, the last
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.200]   30 days of it, the price really starts to tumble.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.240]   So get the quote now.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.280]   You know a new iPhone 6 is going to come out.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.280]   Maybe wait a week.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.280]   I don't know.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.520]   And get a quote and then you've got that locked in for 30 days.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.480]   If the new iPhone comes out, you want it.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.360]   You can sell your old iPhone at the top price possible.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.200]   And I think that's a real advantage.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.800]   They will buy a lot of different devices, not just iPhones.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.520]   By the way, they do buy broken iPhones and iPads.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.880]   They'll buy tablets from Samsung, Google, Microsoft.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.720]   They'll buy Apple's computers and monitors.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.680]   You go to gazelle.com, you'll see all the different things.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   Old iPods.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.680]   You want to get the new iPod touch?
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.040]   Great place to go get, sell the old one and get the new one because the best stuff that
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.920]   goes to gazelle gets, they turn around and sell in their buy certified program.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:11.200]   Two different qualities available, certified like new and certified good.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.600]   Like new is self-explanatory.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.160]   Those are really truly like new.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.520]   In fact, in most cases, they are new.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.040]   Products people bought and said, "I don't want this."
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   And they sold to gazelle.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.040]   Certified good.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.200]   You'll see that somebody's used it, some gentle sign of wear, but that gives you a much
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.360]   better price.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.680]   And here's gazelle's guarantee.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.960]   All devices have been put through their very rigorous 30 point inspection.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.560]   They are 100% functional and they're guaranteed by a 30 day risk free return policy.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.920]   So if you've broken a phone, lost a phone, if it's time to get the kids a phone, don't
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.520]   buy a new phone for a kid.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   Go to gazelle.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.040]   Sell your phone, payment is fast.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.960]   They'll pay the shipping, they'll wipe the data if you forget to.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.480]   No wonder gazelle's now paid out more than $200 million to over a million customers, including
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.480]   me.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   I use them all the time.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.160]   And now you can buy two.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.400]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E gazelle, sell your gadgets and buy them too.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.920]   The fast and simple way with gazelle.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.560]   We thank them for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.720]   So I'm looking at the slide for Skylake.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:20.640]   The Intel's claiming 10 to 20% improvement in single thread performance.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.200]   This is the ninth generation Intel graphics.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   Much better battery life.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.080]   You look at Broadwell, 8 and 1/2 hours.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.640]   Skylake, they estimate 11.3 hours.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:42.680]   Support for new forms of storage, new forms of USB, for new forms of Bluetooth, CAT6LTE.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.280]   Is this a mobile processor particularly?
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.800]   I still have a mobile version particularly.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.840]   I think that's where their business is increasingly going.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.440]   And I think the MacBook would really, I mean, 30% better battery life.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.440]   Wow.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.800]   And one of the things people complain about, it doesn't bother me, but is the core M processor
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.120]   that Apple chose for the MacBook?
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.680]   People say, "Oh, that's too slow."
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.800]   I don't notice 10, to be honest with you at all.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.680]   Most human tasks doesn't really need that speed anymore.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.080]   It's like what happened with PCs when people stop, or with the iPad when people stop upgrading
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.760]   because it does all the basic things that they do.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.400]   If Skylake's coming out now, could we see before the end of the year a new MacBook?
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   Or would that be too soon?
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.280]   You never say never with Apple because once in a while they pull a crazy Ivan and just
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.320]   spin around on you and you're least expecting it.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.120]   But mostly they renew those things once a year.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.120]   If you look back historically, if they stick to patterns, they typically, once in a while
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.400]   do a processor bump, but it's the same sort of processor.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.920]   It's just a speed bump literally.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.120]   And otherwise it's a once a year thing.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.360]   We already had both MacBook errors.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   We had the new MacBook.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.200]   The MacBook errors went to Haswell, sorry, the Broadwell.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.320]   The 13-inch MacBook Pro went to Broadwell.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.880]   And the 15-inch went to a speed bump to Haswell.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.960]   So that's a pretty good cycle for them already.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.360]   That's kind of what this article is saying.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.280]   This is Mac Rumor's Y Series, which is the MacBook.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:07.760]   Y Series would go to the MacBook, which would give it a 70% CPU bump, 41% faster graphics.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.000]   Of course, that's really more important probably than the CPU bump.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.240]   And up to 1.4 hours better battery life.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.480]   Then the Air would get the U Series, the Pro would get the H Series, and iMacs would
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.680]   get the S Series.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:25.320]   And all with similar CPU performance improvements, varying GPU performance improvements.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.840]   Which is important with Metal now being the base layer for Core Graphics and Core Animation
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   and all that stuff.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.400]   Yeah, 41% better graphics would be a big, big improvement on the MacBook.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.520]   Again, I don't notice this, but...
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.520]   This is the...
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.520]   So the die shrink was a hard part.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.480]   The die shrink for Broadwell is what made it take so long.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.480]   It's 4x...
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.400]   Yeah, and they're working on 10, how realistic that is.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.920]   We're starting to get into Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm at a certain point.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.480]   But right now, just getting it down to 49 meters was supremely hard and it caused all
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.120]   these delays and low yield rates.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:57.040]   So my understanding is that Skylake is the architecture change on the same process size.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.840]   So theoretically, according to Intel at least, they've done the hard work and this is more
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.000]   of the evolutionary step that gives you all the benefits afterwards.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.800]   When did Apple announce the MacBook?
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   At the March event.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   March.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   With the second Apple watch.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.360]   And it came out in April.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.360]   Yes.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.720]   Although it was hard to get for a couple of months.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.880]   Anything that had forced such was hard to get.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.200]   I know it's a quick turnaround.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.000]   They did it once before with the iPad, right?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.960]   They had to fix probably iPad 3, got them to retina really quickly, but that GPU proved
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.400]   problematic in the field.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.600]   And so getting an iPad Air 4 out was good for everybody.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.000]   I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple jump the gun on the MacBook.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.400]   And there's usually a Mac event in October, Leo.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   In October, be the time you do that.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.280]   Yeah, and I think that they might do it without any fanfare.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.640]   I mean, I think that that's one of the things that Apple has kind of moved on to with their
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.640]   adjustment.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.880]   They just kind of, you know, oh, it happens now.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   They'll be a little press release.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   There won't be any major announcement.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.280]   There won't be anything else.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.840]   It'll just suddenly just get a little bit better.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.800]   Anything else you would fix on the new MacBook?
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   You could price drop.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.720]   Like one of the things they do do is price drop the existing processors and then add either
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.600]   a lower cost or a higher cost option on top of it.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   Here's what I would fix.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.200]   Having used the MacBook now.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:17.360]   As my main computer for, I took it to Europe with me.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.920]   I would, two things I would do.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.320]   First of all, the camera on it is unconscionably bad.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.360]   I don't know why it's so bad.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.600]   So you want to Z-index on a lot of those cameras.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.400]   They need the depth and they made that so small with so little space that they couldn't.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   Yes.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.400]   It would be very hard to get a better camera in there.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.560]   But that's something that, you know, they traditionally work on very hard for future generation.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.680]   It may be that they just figure, well, if you need a camera, you'll buy a Logitech.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.600]   They couldn't even make the Apple logo glowy.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.000]   It is so thin now.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.040]   And then it really, it would be, I love Type-C.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.240]   All you need is two, just like the Chromebook Pixel does.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:57.760]   Because then I love the idea that you could charge it on either side, whatever is convenient.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.640]   And then the other port can be used for everything else.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   That's all you need.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   I think that would be sufficient.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.600]   It designed the choice for this.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.120]   I think you should have six.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.120]   No, no, stop it.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.120]   That's your weird.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.120]   You're just a weird.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   I'm not kidding.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.200]   What do you do this?
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.720]   And I got a card reader, a USB Type-C card reader.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.800]   There's a number on the market.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.600]   They're cheap.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   Fast.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.520]   It's great.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:29.280]   You know, my favorite USB-C accessory is, though, my 16,000 Nelliep, our iPad battery.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.400]   Because now you go from this device that has about a seven or eight hour battery life
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.760]   to about a 17 hour battery life.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.560]   Because you just plug that battery into your MacBook and it charges.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.480]   And I used to carry hypermans.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.040]   It's a standard power plug.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.160]   It doesn't care where its power comes from.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.760]   The battery indicator might lie to you about its charging state.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.360]   It'll be charging slower than off of your brick, but not that much more slowly.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.440]   And just the ability to say, I don't care about power.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.360]   I don't care about power outlets.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.960]   I'm free, free, free, free.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.360]   It's my brick.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:06.080]   I also find, unlike Alex, I was concerned about the lack of ports as everybody was in
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   the MacBook.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   That has not ever come up.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:15.800]   And maybe it'll be different when eventual pro comes out and I'm happy with a big brick.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.440]   But I have to admit that there's almost on a weekly basis.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.360]   I have situations where I'm using literally every port on my Mac.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.720]   You know, I'm I read you're so unusual.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.880]   Everything is everything is tied in.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.320]   So the idea to give us an idea.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.240]   What is plugged in?
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:38.200]   So typically I have a USB pre two and one that has the audio and then I'll have.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.480]   That's an audio interface for.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.360]   That's my audio interface HDMI that goes out to an external either switcher or monitor
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.240]   on the other side.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:53.280]   And then I'll have and then I either and then I'll have a some kind of like mini recorder,
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.720]   you know, on the, you know, that goes into the Thunderbolt.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.720]   Okay.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.640]   I also use a Thunderbolt for my ethernet connection.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   Andy was right.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   We still need a Thunderbolt.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:09.200]   We still need the ethernet and then I'll have a USB for another USB that one USB that's
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.080]   being used by the USB pre and then I'll have a backup that is going to what's called a
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.080]   MAGE well.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.320]   So I have two different setups anyways.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.080]   So that's this is not difficult.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   And by the way, most of that could be done with the one dongle.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.720]   If it does, yeah.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.160]   And again, it just concerns me putting all those things into one thing as well that if
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.640]   it gets knocked out, then I lose everything.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.160]   And so I, you know, it's one of those things that we actually are using these on the road
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.120]   in a way that probably is not again, it's atypical.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.840]   So I understand that the, uh, but you know, from a pro perspective, like for instance,
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   there's little moves, like for instance, we've all not bought any new retinas because
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.680]   they moved to ATI rather than Nvidia and a bunch of our apps won't work with ATI boards.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.160]   And so suddenly all of our, you know, we're kind of buying freeze over the MacBooks because
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:54.600]   I do have to say that screen on the MacBook is so far superior to the air screen.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.040]   That is, it's a, it's beautiful and it's just the right size.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.960]   The interesting thing is when I, at least when I looked at the research, only between, you
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.760]   know, just over 5% of people actually plug something like an external display into their
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   MacBooks ever.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.840]   So that wasn't a design choice for this.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.200]   Apple actually sat down and said, what if we made a MacBook with no ports?
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.960]   And they said, well, we can't really charge it effectively.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.520]   We had to have one port.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.360]   And since we have to have one port to charge, we might as well make it a multifunction port
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.560]   because like Alton Brown, they don't believe in unitaskers.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.480]   So they made it a multifunction charging NIO port and then you're left with a MacBook
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.480]   with one port.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.360]   And when you look at it from, well, it has too few ports for me, then yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.680]   But that's why they have the Mac Pro.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.440]   When you look at it from, this is like a machine that could possibly exist in a universe where
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.600]   ports are no longer a thing.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.600]   And it's like, oh, cool.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.560]   This is a really cool experiment from a company that has enough money that they can do a
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   really cool experiment.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.760]   I just for traveling, I think the boy was so light, it was easy and it did everything
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.760]   I want.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.280]   And when I wanted to go, you know, to different parts of the ship and sit and work and do
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.360]   stuff, at least in I brought our MacBooks, it was so easy.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.360]   It was just, it was beautiful.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.960]   It's like an iPad that opened up.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.360]   I think the key to it is that this is an addition and an expansion to the MacBook line.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.680]   This doesn't replace something that already exists because it is kind of an experimental
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.400]   device at this stage.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.000]   I don't think it's ready to take on the full burden of an iPad Air and the product line.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.280]   Certainly not the full burden of the MacBook Pro and the in the product line, but you have
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.840]   nothing to complain about the fact that you live in a world in which the MacBook exists.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.480]   Because if you don't like, it's not appropriate for you, you still have all of your options
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.480]   available to you.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.280]   I do think that though, if there's one feature, apart from fixing the camera that they really
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.480]   want to do, it is to put in a second USB-C connector on there because there is something
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.520]   about you are down to 20 minutes of battery.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.600]   You have a camera card with pictures that need to go somewhere.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   You are screwed with one.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.960]   That's the one that's there.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.560]   It's sometimes you can't be really, you can't be seduced by the idea of, well, we did a
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:52.120]   poll and we did a survey and it turns out this feature is only used by 5% or 4% of the people
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.880]   because sometimes it means that this is not used all the time.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.080]   These are people who use it three times a year, but the three times they need it.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:03.520]   Oh boy, do they need it.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.920]   That's the one feature that I think they should add, which is the second port.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   Agree with you?
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.760]   I can live without a better camera, but a second port would be very, very nice.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760]   We don't know.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.920]   Hi, Andrew, I was asking in the chat room.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.720]   We don't know how well any individual max sell do we?
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.880]   We know the overall.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.400]   That Apple never reveals that.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.760]   People do product mix math, which is you never know how good it is, but they're usually pretty
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.760]   good at it.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.400]   Do we know if the MacBooks do in work?
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.400]   I think it's really to tell.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.200]   Especially the MacBook Airs have been one of the most popular sellers because they're
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.040]   $900 basically, which Andy's talked about previously.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.480]   This is a much more expensive computer.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.440]   It's not really that my only criticism of it and it's not a fair criticism because I
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.720]   know what it costs to make this machine and it really is that joke about the first one
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.520]   costs a billion dollars and the second one costs much less.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:53.880]   But it's a perfect computer for people and it's currently priced too high for the people
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.880]   who would often benefit.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.840]   Yes, $1300 at the base unit.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.680]   And the original MacBook Air was $1700 and now it's $800.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.280]   So these things go down over time.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.920]   I just hope that that goes quickly.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.760]   You get this computer under $1,000.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   It's so well.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.680]   It itself very well.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.560]   I mean, it's...
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.360]   And of course I did the upgraded version, which means it cost me a lot more.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.360]   What did it cost me?
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360]   $15.99.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   That's outrageous.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.360]   I got gold, Leo.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   Of course I got gold.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.360]   Of course I got gold.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.680]   So we bought one for Lisa in gold and I said, because she didn't want gold, she said,
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:33.320]   I said, if you want titanium or whatever they call it, space gray or silver, just let
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.760]   me know and I'll get that and then we'll swap.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.440]   And after about a month, she said, "No, I think I'll keep the gold."
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.440]   So I got gold too.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.720]   It's even though we have the same exact laptop.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.600]   It's been all right so far.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.840]   The space gray is ugly to me.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.360]   Silver just looks like it's another Mac.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.080]   Gold looks like it's something special.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.720]   I got to say, going back to that so-called ugly phone you showed earlier, I really wish
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:05.680]   that there weren't such a consistent design language for Apple across all devices.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.320]   I really wish that you could see at least one device in this product line where they
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.920]   really said we don't have to go with the same two types of metal, the same type of metal,
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.120]   the same three colors, the same rounded corners.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.120]   Actually, they did.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   The Mac Pro.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120]   I'm talking about laptop.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.120]   Good point.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.400]   But I'm talking about things like laptops and phones.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.240]   Things that are more of your personal daily carry sort of devices.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.920]   Yeah, because you never really see the Mac Pro really.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.640]   I mean, it's put it in a backpack.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.720]   I'm sure Alex has two of them in his backpack.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.720]   You can have a third one, Alex, if you want.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.760]   Salty and cheap.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.880]   My Mac Pro has never worked right.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.480]   You bought one early, you bought one right out of the gate.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   No, I know.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   You don't do that.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.480]   You wait for me.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.560]   I've replaced it with a 5K iMac and I'm very happy.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.560]   It's faster.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.560]   Rev Aboard's Leo.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.560]   There's a thing about Rev Aboard's.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.560]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.920]   That's why it really is weird that the iMac really is becoming the new Mac Pro.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.400]   People just don't care about having the separate box and the separate everything else attached
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.160]   to it now.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.600]   It just shows you that how commoditized our needs even for heavy-iron computing has
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   become.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.240]   That's so long as you have this one configuration, give me a really good screen, give me enough
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240]   stores.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.600]   I can deal with it, give me some enough ports.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:28.440]   I can plug in external storage and connect me to a good network and I'm good.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   There were a lot of people.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.880]   I remember when the new Mac Pro first came out.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.200]   There were a lot of people with pent up.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.360]   I've had this $5,000 for a new Mac Pro for the past two years and I'm fine.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   I can buy it.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   I'm damn it.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   I'm buying it.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.240]   But in the past year and a half, I mean, even people who are telling me what they're
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:48.400]   buying and also people coming to me for advice for buying, the Mac Pro is not their first
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.880]   choice at all.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.560]   They're looking for a reason to get it and they're not finding it now that they have
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.240]   this 5K display, this one box that just take it out of the box and be up and running and
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.720]   dancing in 15 minutes.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:03.600]   I have to wonder if the Mac Pro, not the Mac Pro is selling.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.000]   This is an example of why you don't do really weird designs.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   You can't really rack it.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   It's like a Lamborghini or a Ferrari.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.240]   I don't think I can get as much as it's Toyota.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.160]   It's so different when you have, again, the daily carry device.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.360]   I love the sort of, there seems to be sort of continuity between, if you watch these
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.680]   movies on Turn to Classic movies and you see the top of a man's dresser and you see the
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.160]   gold cigarette case and you see the lighter and you see the fountain pen as they get
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.320]   dressed and they load in their pockets with these pieces of really finely crafted jewelry
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.600]   and you can tell something about who this person is, by what's engraved on their cigarette
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.280]   case or the fact that it's a Cartier enameled case and not something else like that.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.880]   We look for a little bit of differentiation with this sort of stuff.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.280]   That's why it's okay to have a case design that is that so many people are going to
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.360]   think is just plain ugly.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:56.560]   But if you look around and you see that everybody has the same space gray rounded corners thing
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.520]   with a logo in the back of it and you aren't.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.920]   Here's something that's more of a black with these beautiful, really dramatic slashes of
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.920]   color on it.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.400]   I mean, I like Motorola stuff for a bunch of reasons, but I have to admit that one of
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.120]   them is that if you want to have an electric pink phone with purple trim and gold, you
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   can have it.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   They don't judge.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.360]   They just want your money.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:24.160]   You just described my new motor route Moto G. Exactly how it's going to look.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:31.120]   I'm considering getting a Moto G or a Moto X after the announcements last week for as
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.360]   my personal carry.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.960]   The only disadvantage is that how can I choose?
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.200]   And part of it will say I actually I have never owned a pink phone.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.280]   I bought my first pair of pink socks over the winner and made me think, why do I not
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.040]   own any pink things?
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.920]   And it's like, boy, I like that.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   That's wrong.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   Don't tell us a Brett Hart.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.040]   This is a really good topic.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   I had this.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.120]   I'm absolutely dead serious.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.080]   I needed to replace the case on my Nexus 5 because the old one was finally like all worn
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   out.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.160]   And so I go through go to Amazon, you find here's a good like rubber case for 14 or 15
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.520]   bucks available in 19 colors.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.920]   And I realized I'm just picking the same four color, the same boy colors I normally do.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.920]   And I just read about it.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.760]   Why am I not even considering the pink one?
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.320]   And so I bought the pink one.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.960]   Good man specifically because I would never have considered it as your in your manhood.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.800]   Oh, it's not even that.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.360]   It's a pretty color.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.360]   It's lovely.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   I like having it.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.000]   And so now I'm actually considering it.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.200]   If I have the opportunity to buy an actual like you can't cover up the fact that this
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.680]   is a pink phone, maybe I would get a pink phone with purple highlights.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.680]   It would be cool.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:44.280]   I would enjoy having that on my desk or having the next to me like when I'm having lunch
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.880]   somewhere, no one would mistake my phone for someone else's and nobody.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.840]   Let's a good argument for it.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.160]   Let's build Andy's phone.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.240]   You want white or black front?
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:01.680]   To match actually I want the I want the the the the contrariness of black matched with with
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.600]   the angry color next to the peaceful color.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   I want a black front.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   Oh, they don't have pink.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.480]   They only have well, that's pretty that's raspberry.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.040]   Is that okay?
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.800]   They don't actually have lipstick colors now.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.240]   They don't have normal names anymore.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.640]   There's go go go with the raspberry raspberry.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.640]   Okay.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.800]   And then the accent we can get pink.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   There you go.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.320]   Oh, no one's going to have that phone Andrew.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.800]   I think that is legitimately cool.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.360]   Would you like a shell with this a flip case or no?
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   Well colors.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.240]   Oh, we got turquoise.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.240]   We got charcoal.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.760]   We got crimson.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.280]   We got raspberry could match.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.440]   I think I think the crimson offsetting the crimson offsets the raspberry in a kind of
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.440]   an elegant way.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.440]   Okay.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:52.160]   And let me just engrave this with love from Leo that that'll fit.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.160]   Okay.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.160]   Put that.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.400]   That's a long I'll just put love Leo.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.000]   That sounds like a reminder.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   How about hugs from Leo hugs.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.200]   There you go.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:12.000]   This is why you're the words Smith from Leo hugs from Leo.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   There you go.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Right on the phone.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.280]   Would also make a great band name any listeners hugs from Leo and I'm going to make you I'm
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   going to I'm going to get you the big one.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.520]   So so okay.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   There you go.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.120]   We're going to send this after you Andy, but you have to use it.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.120]   You have to I'm looking forward to it.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.120]   Awesome.

[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   I'll get your.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   Okay.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.800]   Well, at least it has your dress because we send you checks, I believe.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:38.560]   I will I will check to never cash because I guess you're independently wealthy because

[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   The hugs.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.960]   All right.

[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   Okay.

[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   They're cheap.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.440]   There you go.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.760]   It's a pretty credible phone.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.560]   I'm looking I'm looking forward to receiving that and I will use it.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.560]   All right.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.680]   I expect to see it is including hugs from Leo.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.200]   We expect lots of pictures of you with the phone.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   That's what we want.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.440]   We want pictures and you like we're all with the phone.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.880]   I have the phone and the phone and then just the phone and the squirrel in the phone.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.960]   It actually has a pretty decent camera on it.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.560]   I think you're going to like the camera.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.560]   They finally yeah.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   It's the Mac.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.560]   Oh my god.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.960]   The cameras on the Motorola phones.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.560]   Oh my god.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.000]   It's like they finally realized that oh we knew the people take pictures.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.600]   Actually look at those pictures after they.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.600]   Oh damn it.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   Okay.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   All right.

[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   awesome.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.400]   I'm so glad I could get you that.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   Renee.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.400]   Pink phone.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.400]   Absolutely.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   Andy and I will wear them with pride.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.900]   Alex, you can have cameras.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.900]   I saw this amazing.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.900]   I don't like in if I can tango.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:41.900]   No, no, you're changing the subject.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:42.900]   You're changing the subject.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.900]   No, that's fine.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.800]   I would love a pink phone.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.960]   I was just saying I saw this amazing demonstration of accessibility on the phone.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.360]   It was a phone app which I didn't know existed but they had they were showing very low sight
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:59.160]   and blind people using the camera app and it was saying two faces in the picture low
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   light good light focus.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   Oh that's nice.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.120]   Or blurry and then it would help them find the pictures again afterwards.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.560]   I didn't even thought about this technology.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.160]   You know it was just it was an incredible demo.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.840]   We're going to have a huge we're going to have a huge revolution in photography I think.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.840]   Actually Renee.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.560]   No, I'll tell you what I'll send you the pink phone Renee.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.280]   Alex you're going to get this phone.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.800]   This is the yeah little Lego phone.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   Little jealous.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   I'm right.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   Is that coming pink?
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.800]   No, this is comes only in utilitarian gray.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.800]   This is we're looking at the project.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.000]   Our phone and these are all the phone blocks.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.760]   I'm all over the art.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.880]   I I I I is only available in gray.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:46.360]   It causes us to not polish because the architect the leg architects you much like time for your
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.480]   father's function.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.040]   It does not receive any phone call.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.920]   You will nothing from the world.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.000]   It's only said to be a fate.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.880]   A passing by a time.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.200]   At all times.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.800]   We'll have to go to Puerto Rico to get this for you.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.520]   I'll take I'll take pictures of me with using it.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.520]   I'll test it.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.520]   I'll get new plugins for it.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.760]   I'm actually really excited about this phone.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.160]   I think I think it would be cool.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.600]   Julep to in our chat room.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:18.400]   And I think a Julep came here just to tell me this is a hundred tells me 130 years
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.400]   ago.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.720]   The color for baby boys was pink.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.920]   Where nice about I mean we're we're remarkably reversible people.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.120]   Reversable.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:33.320]   So I find that fan fan today.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.040]   To go back to the phones for just a second I was having a conversation with my grandmother
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.040]   who's 94 now and she was talking about I was talking about the fact that I still have a
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.960]   phone in the house that has a crank on it.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.440]   You know what you ring.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.440]   Can you use it?
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:48.120]   No, it's not connected to anything anymore, but it's in perfectly working condition.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.120]   Alex is calling Klondike 945.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.120]   Hello, sir.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.120]   This is better.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.840]   It's got the instructions on like what you're doing.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.120]   I was asking her about the instructions and she said oh we were we were.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.000]   She still remembers she was we were one ring five.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.520]   And and so she said you had to listen for how many rings happened on the phone to know
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.400]   whether it was your call or not because it was a party line.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.600]   And so she said it was like you know you pick up the phone and and you had it scheduled
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.240]   and you pick up the phone and you'd be listening to the end of somebody else's call because
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.080]   you're all on a party line and you had to and it was this whole process of of what how
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.800]   many rings and connections you said it was a big deal when we all she said then then we
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.640]   got one we all had our own phone number.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.640]   It was quite a thing.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.880]   You know, well think about it because at the time, if I even when she got her own phone
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.440]   number, you had to have a separate wire for each phone.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.720]   Yes, the only way that you could connect the most of the wire from your phone goes to the
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.800]   central office.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.200]   That's your so they had to put wires up for every phone.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.480]   Now of course we have more sophisticated means.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.880]   You know what that crank did by the way.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.080]   Do you know that what that did?
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.640]   I think it go ahead.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.000]   It started the cast and generated electricity.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.160]   It was a little elect it was a little magneto to generate electricity which would go down
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.600]   the line and ring the central office.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.600]   Right.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.960]   You can tell them you need to connect.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:08.520]   You sent some electricity down the line and their bell would ring and they got what is
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.520]   it?
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.520]   What?
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.440]   You had to call like this before you called you just had to go like this before you called
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:18.440]   it.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.760]   We reinvent the stuff all the time.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.840]   At one time there was some concern because of course in those days they only used women
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.320]   as operators and there was concern that if the phone network continued to grow at the
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.840]   pace it was growing that every woman in the United States would be employed by the phone
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.560]   company.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.760]   We figured out a better way before we had to go.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.320]   Once they start making their own money, they're going to ask for the vote and then
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.800]   they're going to smoke.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.480]   That representation in Congress?
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.480]   Smoke cigarettes.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.160]   It's the end of the line my friend.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.800]   President of the United States.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.680]   So we actually have some news.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:58.160]   We've just been having fun and I haven't yet done one news story.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.160]   I guess the intel thing kind of was.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:07.960]   Apple, let's see, there's some concern and I don't know if this is overblown or not.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.680]   So I will let you guys help me with this one.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:17.080]   This comes from Dan Gooden who is a very good security writer for ours Technica.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:20.400]   He says zero day bug and fully patched OS 10.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.200]   That's our current OS 10 comes under active exploit.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.600]   In other words, there are exploits out there to hijack your Mac.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.040]   Now we're told the new beta of Yosemite fixes this.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:35.680]   So obviously Apple's aware of it.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:41.800]   It's a privilege escalation bug that comes from new error logging features Apple added
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:52.200]   to OS 10 10.10 and it comes from additions to the dynamic linker, dyld.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.880]   Security researcher Stefan Esser discovered it.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.640]   Now remember, we're going to hear a lot of this kind of stuff and some of it will be
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.960]   scare stories because Defcon and Black Hat are going on.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:01.960]   He didn't discover it.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.960]   He made it public.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.280]   He's previously discovered and disclosed to Apple and then he decided to make it public.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   Oh, interesting.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.680]   So Apple does know about it.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.040]   Malware Bites wrote about it.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:17.880]   I'm not fully sure I trust a company like Malware Bites to report these things in a sensible
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:23.280]   way because of course they sounds I would guess they're a well known anti-malware program
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   for Windows.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:30.720]   I would guess they're branching out to the Magworld and this is conveniently timed.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:38.000]   So the researcher at Malware Bites discovered the exploit when he noticed that a piece of
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:47.120]   malware or junkware that he was installing, VSE, VSEARCH, something like that, modified
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.440]   the sudoers configuration file.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:54.080]   That's the file that lets other people escalate to root.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:50:00.560]   And if you see your sudoers file modified, that's a little bit of a cause for a concern.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.800]   So it's a script.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.080]   That means shell commands now can be executed as root using S-U-D-O.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.960]   I know it's not supposed to be pronounced sudo.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:12.960]   It's just so tempting.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.960]   S-U-D-O I think is how the Linux, Unix, Guru's pronounce it.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.120]   I want to make them angry Leo.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:23.200]   The S-U-Dooers script.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:29.000]   So once that happens, the script uses their new password free permissions to launch the
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.560]   VS installer app that's put in a hidden directory on the installer's disk image, giving it full
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:40.040]   root permissions and then from there your install.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.960]   Now can this be done remotely is the question.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:49.200]   And perhaps it's a little unfair to say that this can happen from a drive by attack.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:56.640]   In other words, going to a website and getting attacked without your knowledge.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.160]   But one has to worry.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.960]   It was just disclosed once again that bad guys have put bad payloads into the flash
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.720]   on Yahoo ads.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.800]   Beyond the flash itself.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.400]   Flash itself is the problem.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:16.200]   I think an execute code outside the sandbox, it's a problem.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.880]   When you hear people write about how it can be executed from a website, you're talking
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.280]   about if you have a website with Malform code that is designed to take advantage of another
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.680]   security problem and another deployment.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.600]   It has to take advantage of your OS's flow.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.560]   It's not like you're not going to go to gocker.com and be punished for going to gocker.com by
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:37.440]   getting a malware installed in your match.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:43.080]   Whether you should be punished by going to gocker.com is a whole other question.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.960]   I had a little time to look into it before the show and there's a couple of things that
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.760]   I think are worth pointing out that aren't always pointed out here.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.680]   And that is that patches are important, but patches are one line of defense for stuff
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.680]   like this.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.920]   The ability that was discovered, it's a privilege escalation, which means it already has to
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.200]   be some mechanism on the computer for the privilege to escalate from.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.160]   So it's not a direct or a motive attack.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.320]   But there's things that are in place that Apple has to try to prevent these things from
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.320]   getting on the machine.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.440]   Even the machine is vulnerable.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.880]   Once they're on, for example, I believe this one, they've already revoked certificate for
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.720]   the malware that's trying to install itself.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.760]   So Gatekeeper will tell you that it can't be installed and you have to go out of your way
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.240]   to install it now.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:25.160]   I believe they've also added the signature to their automatic malware protection system
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.960]   so that if it sees any of the stuff showing up on your system, it will block its access
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.160]   as well.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.440]   And then there's stuff like the Mac App Store so that you're downloading things from trusted
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.720]   sources to begin with or downloading from Microsoft.com or Adobe.com rather than weird
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   web software.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:46.040]   I'm sure all of us are turning, have Gatekeeper turned on at least use the middle setting,
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.120]   which says only from the App Store and signed developers.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.520]   But that will help you from, you know, if somebody emailed you this exploit, for instance,
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.720]   you'd keep you from running it from the email.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:01.000]   The issue still is that if you go to a website that can take advantage of a hole in the OS,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   you still are vulnerable.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.960]   Yeah, we're a phishing attack or spear phishing attack.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   Well, that's what I mean.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.920]   If spear phishing attack isn't going to get you, if you have Gatekeeper turned on, because
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:14.000]   it would have to draw you to a site that took advantage of a flaw in an OST.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.480]   Prettyawesomegame.com to click to download it.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.320]   And it's also a problem with targeted attacks.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.080]   And people assume that you're talking about the government here, but you can also talk
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:28.080]   about people that you know who have a reason to have it in for you, including like you're,
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.080]   you don't, you don't, you don't, you're not aware that your spouse is aware that you're
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.800]   cheating on him or her.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.640]   And he said he or she wants to start collecting information to make the negotiations go very,
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.400]   very smoothly indeed.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.600]   These are the things that make it very, very easy for someone who has just five or ten
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.440]   minutes worth of physical access to a device to just do nothing but plant that one bug
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.360]   and now you've got complete ownership of it forever without anybody knowing about it.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.720]   So it's a big problem.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:58.440]   And it's it is, but it's also a reason why here's part of the hidden advantages of using
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.280]   Apple stuff, both phones, tablets and notebooks.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.000]   They make it very, because they have such control over all their hardware and they have
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.840]   such control over the pipeline from Cupertino to their users, it's very, very easy for them
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.440]   to push out these updates.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.800]   The moment that they decide or decide that it's important enough to deal with and they
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.000]   actually manage to get a patch out there.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.320]   The devices, it's kind of hard.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.360]   Microsoft is very, very good about security as well.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:22.920]   I think they're kind of on the same par as Apple, but on mobile devices, it's just a
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.520]   nightmare to get to have these things addressed as quickly as Apple can deal with them.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:35.920]   But this to be clear is a Macintosh problem and starting on Monday, researchers were seeing
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.200]   exploits in the wild.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.080]   So it's out there.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:47.360]   On the other hand, the good news is 10.10.5, the latest beta of 10.10.5 does fix it.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.040]   What's your, is it, what's your advice?
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.720]   Should people, what should people do right now without 10, 10.5 on their machine?
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.520]   All the stuff Steve Gibson has been recommending for years, like don't download things from
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.440]   untrusted sources, don't click on links, don't think that you've, you've almost run off
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.440]   you something for free.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.160]   It's probably not really free.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:07.240]   And then you trust your gatekeeper setting, set them so that if it's not a trusted developer,
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.280]   it doesn't let you open the application and make it as hard as possible.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.560]   The fault, by the way, the middle of the setting and everybody should turn that on if they've
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.880]   turned it off, turn it back on.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:20.960]   I would not disagree, but I would, I would speak in defense of not using gatekeeper.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.560]   I don't think it's, I don't want people to get the impression that's a stupid thing
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:27.400]   to do because there are a lot of developers who just simply have problems with the amount
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.080]   of control that Apple puts over their content.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:36.240]   I think the money thing to do is if, if you're trying to do something that's a little bit
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.520]   squirrely, like if you're on this forum, they say, hey, why buy this game?
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.320]   I can give you a free, we got this free copy of it right here.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.560]   Or why, why, why pay for access to this site?
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.080]   Because I've got this code and let you get on the site for free.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.320]   It is probably a way to deploy something nasty to your machine and stay far away.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.000]   Yes, suspicion is always a good thing.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.920]   Gatekeeper, the middle setting, I don't have any problem with it means you can still download
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.400]   from a website.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:06.120]   If the developer hasn't taken the trouble to get a certificate, you can still open it.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.360]   You just have to command click and say open.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.920]   But it's just one extra step.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.240]   You know, Apple say, are you sure?
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.760]   Because you don't, we don't know who this guy is.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.400]   I love, I love what Apple has done to implement this.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:21.520]   It's almost as if they know how people work because if you have it turned off and now
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:26.080]   you've downloaded something perfectly fine from the internet and it blocks it, it will
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.120]   just simply say, well, okay, we know that you've set your app this way.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.560]   Instead of turning the feature off completely, would you like me to make an exception for
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.600]   this one app right now?
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.760]   And then you don't have to turn it off and then forget to turn it back on again.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:43.160]   If you, if that one app you've downloaded is a problem, then that's a problem with chances
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.160]   are it's not.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:49.880]   And like I said, it's great to see the human being inside the developer, the operating
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:54.240]   system saying, no, that's the most logical thing is to turn it off, but people are going
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.280]   to find a way to forget to turn it back on again.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.720]   So we have to deal with the front.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.600]   And they also, I think, have done a great job with this.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.240]   And it's completely transparent to the user.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:08.240]   It's malware removal and a tool that you mentioned, Renee, it's automatically updated.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.760]   There's no update request.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   It just does it.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.400]   And Apple's able to quickly respond to things like these zero day exploits.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.640]   Yeah, even when they do make a pass, there's no guarantee how fast anyone's, once they
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.960]   release it, it's still not guarantee how fast anyone's going to install it.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.480]   So things that can be done server side are always much faster.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:27.000]   If you, if you, I don't keep it on the strictest setting, you could do that.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.080]   But if you go to security and privacy in your system preferences, the default is, is allow
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.520]   apps at the bottom part.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:40.280]   They're allow apps downloaded from Mac App Store and identified developers.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   In my opinion, that's sufficient.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.680]   I don't think you needed to do the Mac App Store only.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:49.880]   And I think you should be very suspect of anything that doesn't, isn't identified developer.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.680]   I mean, there's something you knew.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.680]   Very few reasons.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.000]   You went out and you got it.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   And you knew.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   For me, it's beta apps.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.600]   I know the developer who's giving me the beta.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:57:59.600]   Right.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.000]   But I think it's sufficient warning.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.760]   You know, look, there's no way any operating system could protect a user against herself
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.760]   completely.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.160]   If you're just a little bit stupid things, you're going to do them.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:17.080]   So it's, I think putting in a speed bump, and there's a pretty good speed bump.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.080]   And there's several now.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.760]   There's like four or five along the way.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.880]   That's really all you can expect any OS to do.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.680]   The real worry, of course, is these zero-day flaws that don't require any user intervention.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.000]   That's by the way, what this flaw is.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.620]   If it's weaponized, put on a website, the website can take advantage of a flaw in your
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.640]   operating system and inject this software.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.640]   And apparently, there are sites trying to do that right now.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:47.040]   I think that-- do you guys-- any of you use a Mac antivirus?
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.040]   No.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.040]   No.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.040]   No.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:54.640]   I think the latest recommendations from security experts is that any virus is because of zero
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.400]   days, any viruses aren't particularly useful.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.200]   They give you a false sense of confidence because--
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   And the things that they want--
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:07.360]   They want certain privileges from Apple to be able to do deeper access themselves, but
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.360]   those open you up to--
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:11.280]   They often are in a virus in a way themselves.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:15.080]   I would much rather that Apple and Microsoft and Google handle their own security.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:20.200]   Now here's one that's even more concerned, although less and more at the same time.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.600]   This is not something in the wild.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.240]   This is not something that's out there.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:28.840]   Researchers have created a firmware worm that can even attack air-gapped Macs.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.360]   Now we've known about-- what is it called?
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.360]   Thunder Strike?
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.360]   This is Thunder Strike 2.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.360]   Electric balloon.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.360]   But it's called music behind it.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.160]   There's got to be some music.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.560]   But this in conjunction with a flaw we just mentioned, one of the things that they could,
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:48.080]   if they could get this privilege escalation, install arbitrary software, they could in
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.920]   fact install this, installs into firmware scanners, don't ever look at firmware, and
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.280]   other reason why an antivirus is useless.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:58.800]   And then when you did things like plugged in a thunderbolt connector, thunderbolt has
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.560]   a place to write to on the connector.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:06.200]   They write the worm to the connector, and then when it's plugged into other devices,
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.600]   it infects those devices.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.680]   Much as a floppy in the old days could be infected and passed around.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.680]   Snickernet.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680]   Well, I--
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.360]   And this is very related to the USB.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.080]   Is this very similar to the USB?
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.320]   It's similar to bad USB, although it takes advantage of a flaw in EFI.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.560]   It's option ROM is what it's called.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:31.080]   And I think that we can thank actually the US government for really making this possible.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:37.360]   Because this is the technology that we use in Iran for Stuxnet is to hack the firmware
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:44.360]   and so that this has been really pioneered by our own--
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.920]   And it's also why a monoculture is a bad thing.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.680]   You know, we were talking about innovation and different stuff.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:56.960]   Part of the reason this works is because the EFI that's used by Apple is also used by
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.240]   PCs and this is actually a modification of an attack.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:06.400]   The effects Dell and Lenovo, because they all use the same reference software exactly.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.080]   So monocultures is a bad thing.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.720]   It's a little diversity would be a good thing.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.600]   So I glad to get taught us this lesson I feel like Leo.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.760]   And we just haven't learned from it.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.280]   Yes, we should all be like Galactica with have to ring central when you want to make
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.920]   a call.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.760]   The demo that the researchers showed and they're going to again, this is a black hat I think.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.880]   Maybe it's Defcon.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.760]   Used an Apple Thunderbolt to gigabit ethernet adapter, probably something similar to what
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.760]   Alex Lindsay uses.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.760]   Yep.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   It's exactly what I use.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.600]   In fact, the option ROM on an external SSD or on a RAID controller.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600]   Nothing.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.600]   No security product currently checks the option ROM on ethernet adapters.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.480]   There's a business opportunity, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:55.200]   Or a platform opportunity to encrypt the firmware and firmware updates with signatures.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.320]   Well, one thing we've seen, you know, this USB, Flub Add USB has been around for months
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.320]   now.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.920]   No one has modified how they make USBs.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.920]   None.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.720]   We just say, okay, we're going to live with it.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.840]   Well, I think modifying the firmware on the device is something a manufacturer could do
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.440]   where USB is a standard and probably goes through that clascial.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.720]   No, it's because they're including EEPROMs on USB.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.120]   They're like an irreasible read-only memory.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.400]   And so there's, and you could easily take that out.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.920]   There's the reason they leave it on is so if there's a Flaun manufacturer, they can blast
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.000]   new firmware into the USB port but a device.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.080]   But they could take that out.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.960]   That probably costs them money, believe it or not, to include.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.240]   And as to my knowledge, nobody has done that.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240]   It's like chlamydia.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.560]   We've just decided to live with it.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.120]   The good news about Thunder Strike 2 though is that we--
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120]   We're not trying to--
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120]   We're trying to--
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.760]   Okay, TMI there.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.760]   Okay.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.800]   10.4 breaks Thunder Strike, the proof of concept at least.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.040]   And 10.5 might break it more.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.240]   So like again, they're aware of this and they're modifying things to sort of prevent
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.240]   these sorts of times.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   You trust our Apple overlords to fix this stuff fairly quickly.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.720]   Well, some of the stuff, like some of the coverage, it feels like a tech reporter wakes
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.720]   up, reads the black hat.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   I know.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.240]   Speech things and then just makes the crate.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.640]   Like the headlines that killed me was like, your Mac is vulnerable and you don't even
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.240]   need to be on the internet for it to happen.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.960]   And it's just those headlines don't actually explain that it's not that it's not an internet
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.760]   thing because it is an internet thing but it's that it's also a sneaker net thing.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   So your air gap doesn't.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.800]   But just take the time to explain it rather than throw the headline up there.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.320]   Is Hock and Berry writing for you now?
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.320]   We have a series of guests.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.440]   So what we decided to do in standard, he came on is do a series of guest columns where
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.240]   he could get like community voices.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.040]   So we try to get as many people from the community to contribute articles whenever they can.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.560]   And Hock and Berry was kind enough to contribute this love Craig Hock and Berry.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.560]   Furbo.org.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:51.280]   And he wrote an article called Apple pay to the rescue at imore.com.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.480]   Last week I received an all too familiar call.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:00.040]   One of our credit cards had been used to make a fraudulent transaction.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:04.920]   And of course that's a case where his spouse or he was using the credit card for reels
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.440]   not an Apple pay version of that.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:14.400]   So he was curious what happens when your credit card is canceled because it had to be
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.240]   canceled and a new number issued.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.080]   What happens to your Apple pay?
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   It still works.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.560]   Update it automatically.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.560]   That is pretty cool.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.560]   Is it a bank does that?
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.200]   I mean it's a process in place for the I don't know if every bank does automatically but
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   this is a city bank card.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.680]   Wow.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.760]   So he didn't have to get the new card do the long involved process of registering that
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.120]   card on his iPhone and then as Apple watch.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.120]   It just happened.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.680]   And because the Apple watch is decou- like the way that Apple does a security it's decoupling
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.800]   your actual number from the number token that it generates.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.280]   It can just update the one on the back end and then it can just start generating new numbers.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.200]   So it was pretty cool because he thought that maybe there was just a gap in how long it
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.000]   took to cancel the Apple pay credit card but then he got the message and saw that no.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.320]   It's been taken care of for me.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.320]   Nice.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.320]   Really nice.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.680]   And if you've ever had like I've had compromised cards before it's a nightmare to start updating
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.680]   everything.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.680]   That's a pain in the butt.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.680]   Oh, I mind.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.680]   And I have.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.680]   My are compromised every few months.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:12.680]   Wow.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.080]   My I have to admit the more I use Apple pay the more you get sensitive to the fact that
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:23.400]   how insecure your credit cards are you know that you know that it's just something that
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.600]   you know without without the biometrics and having to give out a number and all those
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.440]   things I start to want more and more.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:33.880]   I'm not at a point yet where I say I wouldn't shop somewhere because it doesn't have Apple
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.480]   pay but I could definitely if it became prevalent enough I could definitely make subtle choices.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.920]   I already choose you know Walgreens over you know the other ones.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.440]   Because they have a you know or CVS over.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.320]   You choose Walgreens over.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.320]   CVS.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.320]   There's Walgreens.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.880]   Because they're all they're all down the you know they're all down the street a couple
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.880]   of blogs.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:53.880]   So I can make a choice.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.800]   He says I'm actively choosing Apple pay places.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.320]   And you got to think it's more secure although I mean it's not inconceivable that somebody
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.280]   could somehow figure out a way most likely be involving hacking the bank not you.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.320]   But nevertheless you got to feel that's more secure than handing somebody your credit card
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.320]   number.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.680]   Or my card has NFC on it because we pay for NFC with everything.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.760]   And if I accidentally drop it and drive away from the gas pump the next three people in
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.000]   line can get gas on me.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.920]   Because there's no security mechanism for the card.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   Right.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   You don't have to enter a pin.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   No.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   No.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   And for over a hundred dollars they stop you.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.640]   Depends like some places stop you at 60, 70, 80 but over a hundred dollars you can't use
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.600]   it but still under a hundred dollars is a lot of stuff.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   Like a tank of gas.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600]   McDonald's.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.400]   That's why I love that dollar menu.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.400]   It's great.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:47.480]   I'm saying I fed myself I was at the Boston Comic Con on Saturday and I fed myself all
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.960]   day with my Apple Watch.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.440]   It's the coolest thing in the world.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.560]   It's like it's it's it's it's just short.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:57.280]   If you're a little bit self delusional you can make yourself think that oh no no no.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.320]   This is Andy and not go.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.400]   He never had that panera Andy your money is no good here at Panera.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.920]   We insist here you go.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.440]   They can turkey profit alert soda.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.800]   You know what you need.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.320]   You need a Niko Jarrar pinnacle watch.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:21.000]   It's two two two watches in one a high end Swiss watch and on the other end the Apple
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.080]   Watch Swiss watch right then Apple watch.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.080]   Oh my gosh.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.800]   You know the problem though if you want to use the heart rate monitor on the Apple Watch
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.640]   you've got to put it up face up.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.840]   No we will know you have a Niko Jarrar.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.040]   I got you got a hand it to him they found a way to make the stainless steel watch even
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040]   more expensive.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.560]   I didn't think it was possible.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.200]   It says be uncompromised.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.880]   Well I guess you could say that.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.640]   That's what I got to compromise.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.960]   But tell me if if you want to if you want to buy this as on the on the basis of well
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.440]   I spent $500 for the stainless steel bracelet for this.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:03.200]   What if I make this into just this is like a $420 bracelet for the Apple Watch that also
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:09.600]   has another watch free with it two watches incidentally $9,300 won't be available.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.120]   It's going to take about a year to get it.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.440]   And the problem is that once you when you start charging your Apple watch now you've
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.720]   lost the other watch as well.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.320]   I mean you know I don't think this makes any sense at all.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.600]   I think of the week guys thanks.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.440]   If only if only this made as much sense as Apple's $10,000 watch that makes perfect
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:32.560]   well that's twice the I might point out there is a gold version that has the gold Apple
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:37.440]   watch along with a gold version of the pinnacle $112,000.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.440]   Andy.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:39.440]   I need to watch this too.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.760]   I need I need startup capital early or I want to go on on Shark Tank.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.800]   I've got this brilliant idea of a premium watch product.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:53.640]   It is a $50,000 watch and you get it and the you arrive in the box you open the lid and
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:09:00.000]   for 10 seconds you see a bundle of $20,000 before it just burns and and it ashes while
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   you watch it.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.400]   I think the watch collector would love to see it well.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.920]   It was so well just burn into cinders and getting nothing for it and has a pretty good
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.600]   Omega watch in the box.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.000]   We wind up with a really good Omega watch.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.440]   But I think what people just like is knowing that this sign that says that I had the ability
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.840]   to simply set fire to $20,000 and not even care.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.280]   If it's not enough of a douche bag.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.440]   I'm a bit of a horror just add.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.080]   Yes, you're a horrorologist.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.080]   All right.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.880]   Good said in our chat room says it takes it one step further.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.520]   You'd have Android Wear, Apple Watch, Tag Hoyer, a car, GA.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.600]   Why not just go all the way around?
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.800]   You've got lots of risk space.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.320]   I'm telling you to be serious.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:46.680]   I was actually thinking about this about a month ago that so I'm wearing the I'm wearing
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.160]   the the Garmin Vivo smartwatch, which is hard to activate when you're doing it the
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.160]   wrong way, but or the batteries did.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.400]   Yes, the batteries did.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.400]   Okay.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:01.000]   Given that you can have fitness and notifications on a thing that's about this small.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.120]   This is this is the size of the actual electronics that's in here.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.480]   Wouldn't that be a cool product?
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.480]   Just have an actual watch band that has that part of it so you can watch where you can
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.040]   wear whatever watch you want and just simply add smartwatch features.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.040]   Stick it into the band.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.120]   Yeah, I mean that would be that would be a product that I would actually consider buying.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.600]   That's an interesting idea.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.480]   Now you need to go on Shark Tank.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.960]   No, I want to go and drag into that.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   Drag into the original.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.960]   I'm not going to do some derivative version.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.280]   I think that I think that I think that Andy on Shark Tank would be awesome.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.640]   I think we should definitely push for that.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:41.800]   I'm just not sure if I could even for like $2 million for 20% of my company.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.320]   I'm not sure if I could debase myself to do the sort of presentation they train you
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.920]   to make for Shark Tank.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.400]   Hello, sharks.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   Are you ready to go surfing in your sofa?
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.400]   See, I was getting a little bit of a call.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.200]   I told you get my money, Andy, take it away.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.640]   Mark Cuban's going to love you.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.920]   The one time they drank that pulp bottle of cough syrup, they went right to bed early
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.640]   and that's when Nighty Night Bear was born.
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.640]   I'll buy two.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.960]   But I think you should make one.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.240]   The key is you should just be a caricature.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.640]   The thing is that you have to go up with the-- like if I did Shark Tank, I would definitely
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.600]   be as serious as I possibly could and come up with the most zany idea and just know that
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.800]   if they-- you know, that we're just going to take you down this path and I'm going to
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.800]   build a bunch of stats.
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.800]   I'm going to do a bunch of things.
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.800]   So now I really--
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.440]   The real game is to get past the producers.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440]   It's like an apple.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.440]   Exactly.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440]   Like, I'll let the lapel.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440]   The lapel.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440]   Here's a lapel, Martini.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.080]   I, Bookerine, our chatroom has a good idea.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:47.720]   Take an iPad and duct tape a Surface Pro to it and you've got Windows Mac.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.360]   There you go.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.360]   Dual boot.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.360]   Dual boot.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360]   It's a new way to do a boot.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.280]   One of those spinner toys that makes the bird be in the cage.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.160]   So you put like heavy duty cord, you could actually make it look like it's actually running
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.080]   iOS and Windows 10 at the same time.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.600]   All I need is a million dollars to start up capital for 5%.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.840]   Andy and I, ladies and gentlemen, Chicago, sometimes they'll be here all week.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.680]   Our show today brought to you by Linda.com.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.680]   We love Linda.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.360]   And I think probably Mac Break Weekly is the perfect show for Linda to do ads on because
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.960]   I know you guys like to learn.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:30.040]   Many of you have hobbies like photography, Photoshop.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:36.080]   Maybe you want to develop iOS apps, learn HTML5, or maybe you just want to make yourself
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.600]   more marketable so you can get a new job or ask for a raise.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:47.880]   LYNDA.com is the place to go to learn with more than 3000 on-demand video courses.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.880]   Always up to date.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:54.280]   When Windows 10 came out last week, they day of had new Windows 10 essential apps.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.360]   That's because they work with the publishers to make sure that when the new stuff comes
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.480]   out, they did the same thing with them.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.600]   Final cut.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.920]   They're ready to go.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.840]   If you're interested in photography, a lot of us are.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.840]   There's been long.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.600]   I think Alex, you must know Ben.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.600]   You know Ben.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:09.600]   He's a great guy.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.600]   Love him.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.600]   Absolutely.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.200]   That's his course on the foundations of photography composition.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.560]   It looks like he's in a forest fire.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.280]   But anyway, that's what's cool about this.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.600]   These great videos by not just great teachers, but people who are experts in the field,
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.520]   Ben's a pro photographer.
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:32.840]   There's a new one, the DIY photographer, Joseph Loneski does it.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.280]   This is kind of fun.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:39.240]   You can learn how to make a macro lens or a light diffuser or a camera stabilizer just
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.840]   for a few bucks.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.120]   It's so clever and it's kind of fun.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.600]   This is one you could do with the kids.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.040]   Of course, these guys are guys that I've worked with.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.040]   Well, they're pros.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.640]   And they really are the guys that you want to hear this from.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.320]   These are definitely the pros that you're getting.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:00.760]   And I think that not only is it, there's a lot of platforms similar to Linda.com that
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:07.560]   just can't quite get the quality of the show, the organization of the process, and the right
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:10.680]   talent together in the way that Linda does.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.800]   Yes, she's nailed it.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.320]   You saw the top down shot.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.120]   They shoot this stuff really, really well.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.560]   It's not YouTube videos.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.120]   These are really well made.
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.120]   And very affordable.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.000]   You pay one monthly fee of the run of it.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.040]   So you don't even have to decide what courses you're going to take.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.560]   You can take any number of courses.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.600]   Or look at little bits of individual courses.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.960]   They have a great transcriptions for everything.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:37.360]   So you can search right into the course and find the little bit you want.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.440]   New courses just came out Adobe Camera Raw, Essential Training, Enhancing Images with
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:43.880]   Photos for OS X.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.240]   See, they've already got photos of videos.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:53.120]   It kind of high-end to enhancing images with photos or Photoshop CC Essential Training.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.120]   Stuff like that.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.120]   I'm a fan.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.120]   I love Linda.com.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.000]   Anything you want to know you can learn.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.520]   And I think we love to learn.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.680]   And there's certainly great races to do it.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.840]   Here's the deal.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.280]   Linda.com's membership gives you unlimited access to training on hundreds of topics for
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.600]   the best teachers.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.440]   Beautifully shot for one low flat rate.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:15.720]   And we're going to get you 10 days free so you can really get a sense of what linda.com
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.680]   could bring to the table for you.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.760]   It's a great thing to have.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.000]   If you're a business having a Linda.com account is huge.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.080]   We do that because there's always stuff that our staff wants to learn.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.280]   LYNDA.com/MacBreak to try it free for 10 days.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.880]   The run of the place.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.480]   LYNDA.com/MacBreak.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:45.640]   Did you read the popular science article on iTunes and matching?
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.160]   I thought this was kind of interesting.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:53.360]   It was originally based on work done by Kirk McLaren.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.240]   How do you say his name?
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.240]   Something like that.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.360]   On how iTunes does...
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.760]   Mackelhern I guess is how you'd say it.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.960]   How iTunes does matching.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:09.000]   The original Apple iTunes match did fingerprinting, right?
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.400]   It would analyze the song and come up with a unique fingerprint that was pretty much
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.400]   the...
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.040]   I don't know whether they're using a hash or what, but there's the way to say this is
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.040]   unique.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.080]   This is the live version of the song, not the studio version.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.880]   That kind of thing.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:34.880]   But apparently Apple's music has broken all that and is only using metadata.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:35.880]   Which is crazy.
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.280]   Well, it's risky.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.560]   So, CDDB does this too.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.000]   CDDB doesn't do fingerprinting.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.520]   I think probably because it's computationally intensive.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.480]   But on the other hand, remember, CDDB is identifying a whole CD or a whole recording.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.560]   So it will look at the lengths of each song in there.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.400]   And that generates a fairly unique fingerprint.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:01.520]   But frequently, at least in my experience with CDDB, when you put a CD in and you say
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.840]   identify this, it'll say it could be this or it could be this.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.760]   So this kind of metadata matching is not perfect.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.840]   Far from it.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:16.080]   And I guess Kirk has discovered that when you're doing it with music, there's a lot
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.600]   of potential problems.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:25.320]   He used a piece of music from a disc of Bach chorals, changed the metadata.
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.640]   It was BWV-418 van Gattvillechnacht-Lassen.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.720]   He changed it to Can't Feel My Face by the weekend.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.040]   Which is a bestseller.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.480]   Apple Music matched the file, deleted his local copy.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.880]   He waited for Apple Music to match the file.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.200]   deleted his local copy, downloaded it from the cloud.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.680]   What did he get?
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.640]   What do you guess?
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   He got it.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:54.600]   Can't feel my face by weekend, not Bach.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.040]   Now iTunes match would have got it right, right?
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.040]   Theoretically, yeah.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.680]   That's hard to track because he did the original post.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.760]   There was some errors that were happening server side on Apple.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.600]   He did a second post and a third post.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.240]   So in a day, I think, spent two days trying to see if she could duplicate the errors.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240]   She couldn't.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.240]   No.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.800]   So it's really complicated at this point.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.600]   I'm going back to, well, this service is launching.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.320]   There's significant things that need to be fixed.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.320]   Why would they change how it works if they've got a working system?
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.840]   It's a different system.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.120]   And there's different constraints when you're doing music that you own.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.000]   And it is always in either a downloaded state or an uploaded state to music that you are
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.920]   streaming that might be bookmarked, that might be downloaded, that might be removed
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.480]   from download, but still bookmarked.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.360]   So they have a lot of different constraints.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:43.440]   And if you have a very particular workflow, I remember Kirk's going out of his way to
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.440]   break it with this.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.240]   Like he's deliberately changing metadata and he's deleting tracks.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.800]   That could absolutely happen to somebody through the normal course of operations, but
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.280]   it's not the typical scenario.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:58.480]   And more of a concern with me would be, and Susie Oaks, who was an editor at Macworld,
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.920]   had this problem, a live show being replaced with a studio recording.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:03.960]   Jim had that problem too.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.360]   He has three, he wants three different versions of an Aussie song.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.400]   He doesn't write like Apple thinks it's being clever.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.920]   Like people will complain if there's duplicate versions of music.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.240]   So we'll just automatically make sure there's no duplicates.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.200]   But people like Jim, they don't consider those duplicates.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.800]   Those are variations and they want every single one of them.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.720]   And there's a lot of edge cases, maybe it's a popular edge case too, that Apple music
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.520]   is just not considering right now.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.520]   Anybody want a new old?
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.720]   Because apparently some guy just walked by the studio with a few mules.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.720]   Mules?
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.720]   Mules.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.040]   I have a new Apple music fault too.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.320]   I'm sorry, I don't mean it.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320]   I roughed.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.760]   But I guess he's on a pilgrimage.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.760]   There's a whole new now.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:47.240]   We don't need no sticking badges.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.240]   I know.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:52.880]   He's got to get some chicken and eggs and butter.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.320]   What is mules?
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320]   This is strange town.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.080]   Aren't you glad you left, Alex?
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.720]   I'm alerting Sam Steele in case it tries to cross the border.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.040]   That was the best part of it.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.640]   The best part has been the, the, the, the mules going down the street.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.480]   I mean, you don't, you don't see that in every set.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480]   You don't.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.480]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:12.480]   I apologize.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.480]   The mules are the new squirrel.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.480]   Mules.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:17.480]   What were you saying?
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.480]   I think it a little distracted.
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.640]   Just that there are, there are edge cases that, that Apple obviously didn't consider
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.480]   and needs to take into account when they do their updates.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:29.600]   This is just, this is just why I cringed should even the innocent use of the word edge case
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.440]   because there's, we're all edge cases now.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.440]   So not edge case.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.000]   Like they thought that they were doing everyone a favor by not doing duplicates and that does
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.680]   not, you know, world where there are many variations of music.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.080]   That's obviously not a good thing to do.
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.720]   I just, I think that there's a lot of stuff that we're not going to learn about the development
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:48.080]   of Apple music until lots of people retire from Apple because it like, like any large
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.960]   skill project, there's this long list of things that they want to get done by launch
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:55.240]   day that they can't get done by launch day and they have to defer.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:59.560]   So it does, it does seem really incredible that it wouldn't do something as simple as
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:04.160]   saying, well, okay, this user is telling me that this user's data is telling me that
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.840]   here is American pie, but it's saying that it's two minutes and 12 seconds long.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.560]   I have never seen a, I know that American pie is like 80 million minutes long.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.120]   This can't be the same thing.
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.800]   And it's, it's like this couldn't possibly be a match.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.160]   This shouldn't be a match.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   And that's things that you really hope you only see in a version 1.0 of a product because
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.520]   it should not be a thing where people don't, I'm sure that inside Apple, they did consider
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:34.800]   what happens if you have, for instance, something as simple as you've got, there are a lot
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:40.200]   of Beatles fans who have the stereo version, the stereo mix of the Beatles album, but also
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.560]   the original mono mix that was actually approved by the Beatles.
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.920]   Because you got to know that everybody who's worked on this at Apple was throwing their
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.240]   own music libraries at it.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:53.600]   So, and these are not people who have just only buy stuff off of Apple music or off the
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.640]   iTunes store.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.360]   So it's going to be, it would be really, really cool to hear that story years from now about
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:01.200]   here is what they couldn't fix and they realized they're not going to get this.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:05.600]   There's a complex problem with a nonlinear solution, we're not going to be able to fix
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.760]   it by ship date and we got a ship by this date.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.540]   So let's keep our fingers up.
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:10.540]   Let's just, let's just.
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:11.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.440]   The fundamental thing I think is kind of in the medical community is there's the first
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.220]   thing is do no harm and I think the idea of deleting things.
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.220]   That's hard.
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:19.420]   That's a silly harm.
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:23.840]   If it, if I'm not sure whether I should keep this or not, I should just keep it.
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.480]   Like that was the fundamental error there is deciding that we're not, you know, we're
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.360]   going to use metadata, which is going to be less accurate.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.600]   And then we're not, but we should, until we're absolutely sure this is working, we should
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.760]   just not delete anything.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.320]   And even if it stacks things up a little bit, people would complain about that, but a lot
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:43.400]   less than, you know, losing their music, which is why I have to get my effort in match.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:48.240]   Because I have so much complex audio from my radio days and everything else.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.080]   I just didn't even know how it would deal with that.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.320]   And I just never went down that path.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:55.840]   I still go back to the same thing I think about Apple Photos and iCloud Photo Library
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.120]   is that you should just never touch user data.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.720]   Once you make one of these new cloud services, you take the existing library, you put it over
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.280]   here, then you put the new cloud library next to it.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.440]   And it works like a delta file.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:07.520]   So everything in here is looked at as a change.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.320]   The user doesn't notice that they just get a unified view on the end.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.640]   And that way things can happen in that Apple Music Library.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.000]   And you can even wipe it.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.520]   If you decide that things are out of control, you bookmark too much.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:20.400]   And your core data is never touched unless you personally buy something and add it to
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.800]   that or upload something.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.360]   Because there's an express user action involved.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:27.960]   And that to me, it seems like that would just protect user data, which is the most important
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:28.960]   thing.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.040]   If you complain about duplicates, that's not a destructive complaint.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.040]   That's annoying.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.400]   But if songs are gone, that's a destructive complaint.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.120]   That's your precious data taken away from you.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.360]   That's the kind of stuff you have to avoid.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:43.720]   And once again, I think that part of the best way to create an interface between a piece
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:48.280]   of software or service in a user is to allow the user to take responsibility for their own
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.720]   mistakes.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.480]   People are not going to be upset if they've realized, wow, I wanted the live version of
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.480]   this album.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.480]   Why did it give me?
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.680]   Oh, that's because I've got like three different copies of this and two of them are duplicates.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.800]   Okay, well, that was my fault on a bonehead.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:04.920]   But they don't want is to have a service without beyond their control and without their approval,
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.760]   making a change to improve your life.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.040]   And they're improving your life the wrong way.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:15.160]   As year after year, no matter what it is I'm testing, the thing that gets me and the only
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:20.360]   thing that really gets me enraged is when a software service or device makes a decision
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:23.360]   for me, it is the wrong decision consistently.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:28.080]   It doesn't ask me beforehand and it doesn't allow me to override that decision.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.880]   That's why there are certain device shape holes in the drywall here in the office.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:35.960]   Well, if I just told Siri to call Andy and it automatically called, like right now if
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.600]   I say call Andy, it'll say, do you want Andy's phone, Andy's home, Andy's business?
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.880]   And that's annoying, but I can pick it.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:44.760]   If it just chose which one it was going to call Andy at random, that would be infuriating.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.560]   And I couldn't say, oh, I'm sorry, Siri actually meant this.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.440]   But what's actually infuriating is when if I do something like, I won't use the trigger
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.920]   word, but for so many different, so many different services, message, message Renee,
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.640]   like let's see, I know I've got four phone numbers for Renee.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.400]   Only one of them is labeled as a mobile number.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:07.280]   Maybe you should try to send the text message to Renee's mobile number and not to his two
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.200]   office numbers or his phone number.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.200]   I don't know.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:13.320]   That's what I, if I were writing this as an Apple script, I would probably guess that
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.240]   their user meant a test message.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.920]   And then I get those 18 to emails for three months afterwards.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:18.920]   Yes.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.560]   So this would be, it might be an app time to say that if you want to turn off your auto
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:29.000]   renew on Apple music, because you're getting a free trial until, you know, October or late
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   to September.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.080]   Objection, your honor, countless private, trying to lead the jury.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.360]   How would you, so you go to iTunes, you could do it on your phone.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:45.320]   I'm on iTunes on the Mac, you go to your account, you go to your account info subscriptions.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:46.600]   I want to do the password again.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.440]   Once you get into subscriptions, you could show it.
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:52.560]   Once you get into subscriptions, you'll see managed subscriptions at least on my machine,
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:57.160]   Apple music is at the very top auto renews on by default.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.360]   You could turn it off that way.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:03.360]   You continue with a free trial, but you could decide later if you want to ever pay for this
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.880]   solution.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.040]   Maybe you don't.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.040]   I like iTunes match.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.600]   I'm going to keep that one.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.600]   I love iTunes.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:15.600]   I love Apple music because again, like my use case is simply, hey, Siri, play me whatever
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.800]   music I happen to feel like and it just plays it for me.
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:18.800]   And that's pretty cool.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:23.240]   But I have no, I have no existing live on the opposite of Alex, right, existing live
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.240]   and lose.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.280]   This is the sort of thing we have to, I have to preface by saying I'm not being sarcastic.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.360]   The fact that I started with an absolutely empty library with no music of my own, and
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.840]   I just simply added stuff directly from Apple music.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.360]   It works great for me with that library.
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.560]   It's only when you're trying to make it work with your own music that you brought into
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:45.560]   the relationship before you even met Apple music that Apple music gets a little bit petulant.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.560]   For the millennials.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.960]   I always had issues with Spotify where it would look at your local one and then suddenly
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.600]   that song wasn't there anymore.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.600]   And I just stopped doing it.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.360]   So in Spotify, I know that my expectation is that it's not touching, it lives in its
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:03.920]   own little subscription world, not looking at any of my local content at all.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:04.920]   And then it works fine.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.240]   I think that in this, you know, Apple's the Apple's like whatever, oranges, oranges.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.000]   I think it makes, I think it probably works fine.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.760]   The sad, the really sad thing for me is that I find myself a couple of days ago, I started
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:21.040]   looking for alternatives to iTunes that if I, if I could only have one app that does nothing
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.040]   but manage my local music library and it doesn't know anything about Apple music, it doesn't
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:28.200]   know anything about any streaming services.
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.320]   And I could just simply deal with and manage my own playlist on my own devices with this
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.560]   one app, but then go to Apple music and treat it like the stock, like the Spotify app or
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.560]   whatever.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.760]   My life would be so much better and so much happier right now.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:40.760]   Have you found anything?
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:41.760]   I will.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.440]   I've found a couple that are kind of nice.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:49.640]   Most of them tend to be, most of them tend to be nostalgic in nature saying, remember iTunes
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.560]   for the left version that worked perfectly.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.760]   We sort of, we've just completely duplicated iTunes for in every way.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.320]   I've been using a Vox.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.480]   Have you tried Vox?
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:04.000]   I downloaded that one, I wish it were less like a mobile app and more like like the desktop
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   version of iTunes.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.600]   Yeah, but it's, but well, you know, the part of the problem with iTunes is Marco, Arment
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.400]   and others have pointed out is just trying to do a thousand different things.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:16.400]   So what Vox is really is an MP3 player, right, or an AC player.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.560]   And all kinds of formats.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.960]   And I use it for the high res music playback.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:26.400]   They have added this new feature and I haven't really tried it because it's not free.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:33.280]   You do get a free trial called Loop that lets you use cloud based storage for your music
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:39.040]   files, syncing between the Mac and iPhone in full quality playback.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:47.400]   So I'm just, I'd like to, what I'm missing is I just, it's an actual enjoyable creative
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:52.080]   thing to be sitting in front of a screen that has all my music in it and build playlists
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.120]   and manipulate playlists and update things.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.360]   And when I get new music to side, do I want this?
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.880]   I just downloaded the, excuse me, I just bought the latest, it's a really great live recording
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.600]   of Mozart's abduction from the, from the Soragio.
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.320]   And now I'm listening to these like 43 tracks, including Resident Evil and thinking, well,
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:15.440]   which of these five, what are these other five areas in here that I'm definitely going
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.480]   to want to put into different playlists?
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:20.600]   And that's actually fun and deciding that, well, this one is a really, really fast paced
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.600]   area.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:27.000]   And the peppy music playlist, I want that to appear, appear sooner rather than later.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.560]   And it's that stuff that you really can't get with iTunes or I'm hoping that I can find
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.160]   it with a third party app now.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:38.960]   I would hate to think that I do have a Windows 10 notebook in the office that had acquired
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.240]   for a whole bunch of testing.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:44.600]   I would hate to think that I moved my music library management off of the Mac entirely
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:49.200]   and onto Windows only because there are better music library apps there.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.600]   I don't know that for a fact yet.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:57.200]   Well, actually even Microsoft's own groove music, some, you know, it does the same thing as Apple
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.200]   music.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:02.880]   It's one, it's a streaming solution, but you can use your existing songs within it.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:09.640]   The problem is just like iTunes is, well, iTunes is cross platform, but groove, I guess
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:11.440]   you could use groove on the Mac.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:14.920]   One of the things that somebody suggests in the chatroom, and this is true, is if you
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:21.240]   have a Microsoft office subscription as I do, you have unlimited storage on OneDrive, you
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:26.520]   can move all your music to OneDrive and stream it and everything and it's done.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.520]   It's hysterically funny.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:33.560]   At this point, I've got my entire music library, excuse me, the real version of my music library,
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:38.080]   not every single track I've ever ripped, but the 6,000, 7,000 tracks that matter to me.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:44.840]   I've got complete copies of it in three different places in the cloud only because storage is
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:50.960]   so cheap and rather than keep these things synced from one to have a cross platform situation,
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.200]   it's much easier simply to have an entire copy on Amazon music, an entire copy with
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.960]   Apple and entire copy with Google and just simply whatever device I have, whatever it
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.720]   wants to work with the best, that's what I will let it work with.
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.120]   Well, I'm going to volunteer.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:08.280]   I'll pay for a loop, which is five bucks a month, and let you know, there is no streaming
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.280]   component of that.
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.760]   There's, you know, there's no unlimited music.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:18.240]   This is all about your music, but it does stream your music to an iOS device as well.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:24.080]   And the Vox player, you're right, it's a very primitive, simple player.
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.320]   I think that's the point.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.160]   It's just not what I'm looking for.
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.160]   On the other hand, that's one of the problems with iTunes.
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:31.160]   It's not simple.
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.480]   I mean, maybe there's somewhere in between.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:40.160]   I'm Q Songbird, which is now Nightingale, I guess.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.160]   That's the open source solution.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:46.800]   And if anybody listening has like a favorite like that, again, I'm looking for a desktop
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:52.520]   music library management and playlist app that is as pretty as what I consider what
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:58.520]   iTunes was before it lost its way or better than iTunes, but focused strictly on local
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.520]   local music management and playlists.
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.840]   Well, look at Nightingale.
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.840]   Look at Nightingale.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.040]   I mean, I think it's not as pretty because it's a cross platform.
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:11.640]   A little bit of an issue, but this is free.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.440]   Oh, it's open source.
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.880]   So I don't know.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.520]   I don't know.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:24.960]   All right.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:26.880]   Nothing from the peanut gallery at all.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.680]   You guys are just going to keep using iTunes for the rest of your life.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:33.720]   I have this magical dream where Apple is building a new application side by side.
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.000]   Yeah, eventually replace it.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000]   Got it.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.240]   The call you have to do is get rid of iPods and windows and we'll be fine.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:42.240]   This is the kind of magic.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:45.880]   It is like I will say I have to fix about once every six months.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:50.480]   I have to fix my dad's connection to his who from between his his iPhone and windows.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:54.800]   And I'm like, Oh my gosh, like I do not know how anyone could use iTunes on windows.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.480]   I mean, I'm sure that it's better than what the other ones are, but it is.
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:00.240]   If you think that there's anything, any problem with the Mac, just use.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:02.000]   Oh, yeah, straight use it on windows.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   Oh my gosh.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   It was just insane.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.360]   Like this is one of those magical times.
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.200]   Oh, magical times.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:15.320]   When I imagine that there are people inside Apple who are as sick and tired of iTunes
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:19.040]   as we are and have written their own apps that they have no intention for leasing.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.120]   It's just on their own Mac books.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:25.400]   And at some point, someone's going to walk by, see this like on the on the 27 inch screen
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.160]   in somebody's in somebody's conference room and say, what's that?
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:29.720]   And oh, well, that's just something had together.
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:30.720]   No, it isn't.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:31.720]   That's iTunes 12.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:36.080]   It's like, I'm not going to go too far down a rabbit hole, but we're just complaining
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.080]   about the front end.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.800]   The front end is light years ahead of the back end.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.560]   And they've got to solve a back end problem that runs off web objects that serves billions
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.560]   of dollars in transactions.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:45.320]   Here's two using web objects.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.320]   Sure.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.560]   Look at the URL and millions of millions of credit card.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.280]   No, I mean, they have got it.
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.720]   It's like you have this tower that is incredibly rickety, but everyone is living in this tower
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.320]   and it's super important or a bridge and it's the only way to get in and off the island.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.680]   And you've got to very carefully build another bridge so that nobody like nothing breaks
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.120]   on the original bridge while you're doing it.
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.120]   Is a non-trivial problem to solve?
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.760]   Non-trivial.
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.720]   Can you run Groove Music on a--
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:12.720]   I came up trial S this morning.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:20.880]   And it's Microsoft's former Xbox music, formerly Zoom music.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:26.400]   And it does have the largest library of anybody, I think, larger than anybody.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.880]   Does it have Prince and Neil Young?
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.400]   I don't know if it has Neil Young.
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:34.200]   He pulled his music from all the streaming solutions, didn't he?
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.680]   And so did Prince.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:40.320]   It says, "Web PC, Xbox, iPhone, Android, and Windows fun."
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:45.160]   So you couldn't use his music manager on a Mac, but you could use the website to stream.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:51.160]   Yeah, this seems like there's an opportunity here.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.560]   Somebody in the chatroom suggests J River Media Center.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.680]   I've used their J River software on the Pono.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.040]   I'm not crazy about it.
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.040]   I mean, seriously.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:03.200]   I got at least $20 to spend on a really good music player.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.840]   If it's a really good, then I'd spend $30.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.640]   OK.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.960]   There's the challenge.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:10.840]   $30 waiting for you.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.320]   So as Renee says, I'm not looking to buy the first copy.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.800]   I'm looking to buy the second copy.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:17.920]   I want to make that really clear.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:21.240]   I think the hard part is, is that between the different things that are available, I
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:26.120]   think the way I look at it is, I just don't know how financially viable I'm trying to do
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.760]   this with the players that are already there.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:32.400]   It just seems like a very crowded market with the other advantages.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:35.360]   And I know that we hear that when they said you couldn't do a phone, you couldn't do a
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.680]   watch, you couldn't do it.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:41.480]   But at the same time, just, wow, there's so much advantage to having it tied in across
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.760]   these platforms and everything else.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.760]   I think that we have to hope that Apple's able to do something with it because it's
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.760]   be very hard.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.800]   I mean, as someone who has developed software, I wouldn't even look at that market because
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:51.800]   it's just--
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:52.800]   Oh, god.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.800]   I don't know.
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:54.800]   There's no money.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.280]   It's a consumer market, number one, is so that there's no advantage to being a vertical.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.280]   So there's no price advantage.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.960]   I can't charge $300 for it because there's not any people are going to use it.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:03.640]   I have to charge $5.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.240]   And so-- or maybe $30.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:09.160]   But even at $30, yes, they have incredible penetration to pay the bills.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.840]   So that's the-- unless someone does it as a serious hobby, there's not really-- there's
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.840]   no money in it.
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.840]   That's some billion--
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.760]   It gets really angry at iTunes.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.760]   Exactly, exactly.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.760]   That's what we need.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.760]   Richard Branson to say I've had enough.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.520]   Elon Musk has to do the Tesla and the iTunes.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:25.520]   Exactly.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:29.280]   That's true because now we've got three crazy billionaires building their own private space
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.280]   fleets.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:33.120]   Clearly they've got $10 million to make us a really good music addict.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.600]   Yeah, they're priorities in order.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:39.840]   Just let us use your rounding error to solve this problem of music management on multiple
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:40.840]   platforms.
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:41.840]   What are you going to listen to on your way to Mars?
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.280]   You've got to fix this problem.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.280]   Exactly.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:47.960]   And I think the other issue is that it really gets into we can complain about in an esoteric
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.640]   sort of sense that we're frustrated with everything else.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:55.280]   But for the most part, my playback, whether it's on Apple Music or Spotify is good enough,
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.360]   you know, like I get frustrated with it and like, oh, they should do this a little bit
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360]   more.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:02.080]   But it's not like-- I don't find it to be this.
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.760]   There are definitely things that drive me crazy.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.160]   And that's just-- isn't one of them.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:09.040]   I think that's probably the case for a lot of people is that it's mildly perturbing, but
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.040]   not enough to make them really frustrated by it.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:16.720]   IBM, this is a hell freezes over story.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:23.920]   IBM is moving its employees from Lenovo to Max.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.520]   Don't think that for you.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:35.040]   IBM says they may buy as many as 200 between 150,000 and 200 max every single year.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:41.400]   Of course, IBM is in a partnership now with Apple to do iOS apps.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.400]   But wow, wow.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.480]   How are all two changes?
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:52.280]   That is, you know, Steve Jobs would be amazed to hear this.
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:57.080]   IBM moving-- And do we think that this is anything to do with the security issues that
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:00.440]   Lenovo had earlier in the year as to whether IBM is--
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:04.040]   I think they were using the Lenovo just more for nostalgic reasons, because of course,
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.520]   IBM sold the ThinkPad brand to Lenovo.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.560]   Thinkpads were the greatest.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:12.240]   And I think the Lenovo Thinkpads, which never had this spyware issue, only the consumer
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:18.040]   grade laptops did for Lenovo, are still really some of the best PC laptops made, certainly
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:19.680]   for business.
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.640]   So it's a big shock.
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:27.360]   IBM Vice President Fletcher Previn says he could see half to three quarters of IBM employees
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:32.560]   eventually leaving their Thinkpads and converting to Max.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.000]   Google's a huge Mac shop, too.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.880]   I mean, it's not insignificant anymore.
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:45.480]   Well, Google gives every new employee the choice, right, of a Google Chrome OS Pixel or a MacBook
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.920]   or a Windows laptop.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:48.920]   So the--
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:55.640]   The new employee-- I can't think of a time when I saw a Google employee with anything
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:56.640]   other than a Mac.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.640]   Point is they could if they wanted.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:38:59.640]   Choice is there.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:01.440]   I mean, you see it every once in a while, but it's like--
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.440]   You know why I use it?
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:05.960]   One of the main reasons I use a Mac, which is very kind of not why other people use a
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:11.480]   Mac is I like it, that it's BSD Unix under the hood and I get a command prompt.
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.920]   I like being able to open up the script.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:16.280]   I mean, I probably open up the terminal a couple of times a day.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.280]   It's less the terminal.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:23.400]   And so I think that the terminal is great and being able to dual boot, you know, to get
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:26.400]   into both is important as well.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:28.760]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:29.760]   Come back.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.320]   Your picks of the week coming up.
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:37.400]   But first a word from legalzoom.com.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:43.240]   It's-- I guess-- I said this in July, but I guess August is National Make-A-Will months.
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:46.520]   Because we're in August now and it says it's National Make-A-Will months.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.120]   So I jumped the gun.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:54.880]   Your job this month, if you haven't made a will, Jason, do you have a will?
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:55.880]   You have children.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:56.880]   I do, actually.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:01.240]   Five years ago before I even worked a twit, we used legalzoom to get our will.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:05.320]   So as you have kids, you really got to start thinking about making a will.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.920]   Because if you don't have a will, then what happens to the kids is kind of up in the air.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.480]   The courts end up deciding.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.400]   Same thing with your property, all right?
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.400]   So make a will.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:18.080]   It's very affordable and it's very easy.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:20.800]   In fact, since you did it, Jason, they-- I think they've made it even easier.
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:24.560]   They've got this great kit that you get, the forms and everything.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.960]   Legalzoom's not a law firm, but there are things you don't need a lawyer to do, like
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:31.240]   protecting your loved ones with a legally binding will.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.600]   Starting a business, trademarks and patents, all of this stuff.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.080]   Legalzoom has a better way for you to-- and your spouse to take control of your family's
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:40.080]   future.
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:43.520]   They also do powers of attorney and trusts.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:48.600]   And if you need some help, don't worry, because even though Legalzoom is not a law firm, they
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.960]   have created a network of independent attorneys in most states.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:56.920]   They've got pre-negotiated flat rate, so it's not going to cost you an arm and leg and you
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.000]   can talk to somebody.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   It's really awesome.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.760]   Legalzoom.com.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:09.480]   Use the offer code MBW on checkout and you'll save if you have an assignment this month.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.720]   Take advantage of it.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:12.520]   Legalzoom.com.
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.520]   Make that will.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:16.640]   National Make a Will Month.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:17.640]   Legalzoom.com.
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:22.320]   And don't forget the offer code MBW to save.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.560]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.120]   Let's start.
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:32.520]   I always like to start with Alex, because, you know, he's usually got the high end pick.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.120]   It makes all the rest of us seem cheap.
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:36.800]   The watch with two watches, something like that.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:39.480]   I was going to pick that and then you guys make so much fun about it.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:42.920]   And then I made fun of it and I was like, oh, no, I'm going to pick that.
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:45.360]   No, so I have been two things.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.800]   One is just a really quick website that I think people might enjoy that.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.800]   I really enjoy it.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:51.360]   It's not a Mac thing, but have you seen Fiverr.com?
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.360]   F-I-V-E-R.
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.360]   F-I-V-E-R-R.com.
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.840]   Yeah, what does it do?
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:01.440]   And I just used it.
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:06.160]   So it is basically like this, the stock market of having stuff done for you, whether it's
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:09.440]   video and animation or graphics and design.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:13.720]   And you know, I had, you know, as an experiment, I've been thinking about having like little
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.960]   cartoon heads made of all of our people, you know, all of our employees.
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:23.400]   So I sent, you know, I had mine sent out and I will wrap a 16 line verse song about anything
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:24.400]   you want.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:31.840]   But there's, if you look at the more normal ones, which are like graphics.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:41.360]   Okay, put your shirt back on kid.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:43.360]   Five bucks though.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:44.560]   He says for five bucks, he'll do that.
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.320]   And so what I did, you know, you can do stuff like, but you can, like, you look at graphic
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:51.480]   and design, you can have logo on or illustration or anything else.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.800]   Now it starts at $5.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:57.400]   Admittedly, if you want to add little features like it going a little faster or, or it being
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:59.120]   used for commercial use, it gets a pyre.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:03.040]   I think I spent $40 on having my little head thing done.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.920]   And but the, the interesting thing about this is that it's, you know, that again, you had
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.760]   little head thing done.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.520]   You know, like, like, I took my, my picture that I always use and then he turned it into
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:13.520]   a cartoon.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:14.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:17.280]   I saw the ad on Facebook that you could turn your, your picture into a cartoon.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:19.280]   Did you do that?
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:20.280]   I did.
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:22.280]   I don't, I don't think I have it anywhere that I can get it up.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:23.920]   Plus it'll, okay.
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:26.080]   You could be the last post on Google plus.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:30.400]   You can get a radio ad made.
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.520]   Oh, here's one.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:37.480]   Alex, I will submit your single to 10,000 made your major radio stations.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.480]   Right.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.960]   Oh, here's a guy.
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.840]   Here's a guy who's selling.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.280]   I will promote your business to my thousands of listeners for $5.
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.680]   So like this is, hold on.
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.680]   I think I have.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:49.680]   I think that's illegal.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.600]   I don't want to say anything, but.
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.600]   Okay.
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:55.520]   How much is that in blow?
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.520]   Oops.
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.720]   We just broke Fiverr.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:02.440]   So like, so like this is the, I don't have a better way to show it right now.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.440]   Hold on.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.440]   Let me see.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.440]   Maybe I have a better way.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.440]   Hold on.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.440]   Don't go there now.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.440]   Here we go.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.560]   So this is, this is the cartoon that I like that.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.560]   You know, it was fun.
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:12.560]   Five bucks?
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:13.560]   No, 40 bucks.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:14.560]   40 bucks.
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.560]   Okay.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:16.560]   To have it done.
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:19.760]   But, but you know, and you know, as a guy and you know, there was a fine artist in, in Pakistan
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.000]   who was putting that together.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.680]   And so anyway, but, but I thought that it was a, but you're going back and forth with
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:29.880]   them and I had a couple corrections and he gave it to me on an EPS file and it was like,
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:33.000]   you know, you know, for the amount of time it would take to do something like that.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.280]   It was, it was actually really good.
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:37.520]   And so, so anyway, the Fiverr is kind of a fun one if you're looking for something, you
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:41.360]   know that, and we're just experimenting with it, but it's, it's pretty cool.
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.160]   The, the, my Mac solution or my Mac break real, real one is I've been dying to get rid of
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.160]   my wallet.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:51.800]   Like I just can't, the idea of carrying a phone and a wallet have been something to
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:52.800]   drive me a little crazy.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.640]   You're going to hire a person to walk 10 feet behind you carrying your wallet.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.400]   No, no, they're going to carry the case.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.960]   They're like, you know, my little case of the stuff I need every day.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:03.680]   I'll have those people, you know, pull, pull that case behind me.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:05.720]   A little rolling suitcase.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:09.800]   But in my personal wallet, you need like in VEEP, you need a bag man.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.360]   Yeah, no, exactly.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.600]   So, so, no, so have you seen these Cina, these Cina cases?
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.400]   So these are, that's pretty.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:18.400]   Look at that.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.400]   Look at that.
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.800]   It's like a wallet that holds your phone.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:21.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:25.440]   But it's got just enough for a couple of credit cards in my license.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:26.840]   It's pretty.
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:30.320]   And so, but the thing is, is that this was enough and now, even though it's a little
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:36.800]   bulky around my phone, it is enough that I'm no longer carrying a wallet.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:39.760]   You know, like I keep the wallet like in a bag, in my backpack or whatever, just case
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.040]   there's a couple extra things in it.
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:44.680]   But, but for the most part, just being able to kind of get this, you know, this just kind
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.680]   of solves that.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:46.680]   Nice.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:47.680]   That problem.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:49.320]   And you can throw it and it doesn't break your iPhone.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:52.000]   What does this have to do with fiber?
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000]   Does it have nothing to do with this?
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000]   Is this another pick?
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000]   It was the second pick.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.800]   The fiber was supposed to be like this quick thing and then we started talking.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.800]   Okay.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.800]   That was an even, it was nothing about that.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:00.800]   I get it.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.800]   Pick number two.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.000]   I had this made for five dollars on fiber.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.880]   I did not have that done.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:07.720]   So they make iPhone, do they make it?
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.440]   Is it just for iPhones?
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:11.480]   Um, I'm looking here.
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:14.440]   It looks like, oh, they have iPads, iPhones.
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.440]   iPhones, iPads.
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:17.440]   Nice.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:18.440]   iPads, iPhones.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.440]   They're pretty.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:20.440]   But they're very pretty.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.200]   Oh, look at these are gorgeous.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:25.480]   This is like really kind of upscale.
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:26.480]   How much are they?
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:29.000]   Uh, I do not know how much I spent.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000]   I'm not that expensive.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000]   30 bucks.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.720]   Get fancy and spend more like the folios, seven or an iPad, many as 80 bucks.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:42.960]   But for a phone, I gotta say, for me being able to just walk away from my wallet was
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:43.960]   exciting.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:48.400]   So, so a phone case that your wallet, Lisa uses one of these.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.400]   My wallet and I just don't have a very good experience.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:52.400]   No.
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:53.960]   I find it to be a pain in the butt.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.520]   Somebody needs to reinvent the wallet.
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:57.600]   It literally is a pain in your butt.
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.720]   I have sciatica from my wallet.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.720]   Yes.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.240]   No, I needed to get, I need, I decided I needed to get away from it.
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:04.240]   And I keep my phone.
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:07.200]   And part of it is I keep my phone up on my, my Scotty vest is sitting right here.
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:11.360]   So I tend to keep my phone right here, as opposed to my, my back pocket where I don't
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:12.360]   put my phone.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.840]   They make folios, I bet you they make folios for the Macbook.
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:16.800]   Here's the Galaxies for.
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:18.880]   So yeah, they have a broad variety of things.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.920]   Ah, a Macbook folio would be nice.
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.320]   Little sleeve.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.880]   Very nice.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:31.520]   Okay, that's S-E-N-A, CINA cases dot.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.320]   That's good stuff.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.440]   Renee Richie, you got a pick for us?
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.440]   I do.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:42.200]   So my pick, last week I mentioned briefly that panic had released CODA for iOS, which
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:43.880]   is a fantastic terrific app.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.520]   And this week they released an update to Status Board, Status Board 2.
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.040]   I love Status Board.
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:50.040]   It's so silly.
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.600]   It's silly, but they find such a way to make, to me it makes these devices more than what
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:55.600]   I consider them to be.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.040]   They're almost like aspirational products.
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:01.600]   And what their original pitch for the original Status Board was if you had an old first generation
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:04.960]   iPad that you weren't doing anything with, just hook it up to a monitor and use it as
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:08.840]   your office status board because it's way cheaper than getting some sort of dedicated
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:11.240]   office board contraption.
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:15.760]   And now they've updated it and they went to great pains to sort of allow for upgrade pricing
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:19.040]   and to make it give you options for more boards.
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:24.520]   And it's just one of these delightfully designed panic apps that make you think you can do
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.880]   more with this technology.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:30.040]   So this that you can run JSON scripts to give you graphs about how different products are
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.360]   selling or the tech issues you have with them.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.680]   You can pull in Twitter feeds or RSS feeds.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.720]   It can have who's in the office and who's out of the office.
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:43.320]   And it's just all this really, it's like a notification center for your entire office
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:45.320]   or home.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:47.160]   And again, it runs on your iPad.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.760]   You can plug it into a television by HDMI, you can stream it.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:54.200]   It's just a fantastic, if you have extra hardware running around and if you don't want
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.920]   to spend money to get some sort of dedicated board, but you think you'd benefit from it,
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.240]   it's a terrific way to make that all work for you.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:02.560]   It's not cheap, how much 50, 40?
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:05.680]   Yeah, I mean, they're not one of those companies.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:06.920]   They're more like Omni.
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:10.200]   They want to have good value for software that they provide.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:13.360]   But there is a version of upgrade pricing on this, which is nice.
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:16.680]   And you can get different versions of it.
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:21.120]   Like the original, there was a lot of pushback on the original status board because the update
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.520]   was a $50 in-app purchase and they're thinking, was anyone in business is a no-brainer because
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:27.680]   it's meant to run in your conference room.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.640]   It's meant to be from an executive dashboard.
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:33.880]   Yeah, that's been thousands of dollars without people linking an eye, but because it's panic,
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:34.880]   everybody wanted it.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:35.880]   So they adjusted the pricing.
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.200]   And they're sort of doing another step on adjusting the pricing now.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:43.200]   I love it and I haven't seen the new one, but I use the old one all the time.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.200]   I love it.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:47.240]   My second pick, and this is just more so we address the issue because everyone is asking
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.240]   you about it.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.640]   There was a rumor about Apple becoming an MVNO, basically reselling broadband to everybody
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:55.880]   around the world and making it so you never have to deal with a carrier again.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:00.840]   And it got everyone really excited, but Apple's been exploring that since 2005 or 2006.
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:04.840]   And you could write that story any week and it won't make it any more imminent.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:05.840]   So if that is your dream, or else.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.400]   Same thing with the Apple TV, right?
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:10.840]   John Petitowski had the rumor the Apple TV will be out in September.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.840]   Oh, that's true.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:13.440]   The Apple television.
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.280]   This is like the Apple television where, yes, they're working on and exploring it, but it
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.520]   is not something that isn't an active product line.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:19.520]   The Apple TV is coming.
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.520]   We've known nonsense before, WWDC.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:21.520]   I bet it's done.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:24.040]   And they're just waiting to make the deals.
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.200]   It's all about the content deals.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:27.720]   I don't think I think the deals have finally been decoupled and they're just going to go
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.240]   ahead with the box now.
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.240]   Okay.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.760]   So you believe that's true.
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:36.960]   You believe that's true, that September will be iPhone and Apple TV.
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.960]   Okay.
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:42.480]   Some of the rumors that it doesn't matter.
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.800]   I don't think those deals are going to are what they need.
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:49.640]   4K, SDK, those types of things would be enough to get most people to upgrade.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.480]   Apple Hape.
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:53.400]   The new interface hasn't leaked yet, which is kind of cool.
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.640]   A lot of the rest of it is late.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:55.640]   Okay.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.640]   Oh, good.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.440]   Well, thank you for the clarification on that.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:01.560]   Mr. Andy Inaco, your pick of the week.
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:06.200]   Yes, this week comes a really good weekend for spotting the International Space Station
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:10.840]   because obviously it's always flying overhead somewhere, but it's not always flying overhead
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:11.680]   the United States.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:13.160]   You're part of the United States.
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:17.520]   And it's also not always flying overhead at a time where you are awake.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:21.200]   And it's also not always flying overhead at a place where it's actually above the trees
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:23.240]   and above the hills where you are.
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:28.400]   So this is a great on Sunday and Monday night, you could see the ISS really easily at like
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.600]   830 or excuse me, a New England at least at 830 at night.
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:37.000]   And then Sunday night, you can see it like 915 PM perfects with dark outs.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000]   You can take pictures.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.200]   The next night it was showed up at 830 something PM.
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:44.040]   So it was still enough light that you couldn't get a picture.
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:47.760]   And what you want to have is you want to have this app called ISS spotter.
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:52.920]   And all it does is it just simply keeps plotting the current location of the International
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:56.600]   Space Station against against an actual map of the world.
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:01.080]   So you can see that right now it's about getting close to Chile and South America.
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:03.960]   Of course, it's Bolivia.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:08.040]   So you can actually see you can tell it where you live.
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:10.880]   So I've got like Boston marked here is my home.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:13.480]   And so you can actually see it when it's when it's approaching.
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:15.440]   You can actually see the track that is coming to.
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.440]   And you can also see that if it's are you're going to have to face north, you're going
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:23.840]   to face south because when it comes, you'll be in the sky for about four and a half minutes.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.480]   It's there and it's gone.
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:29.800]   It's easy to spot because it is easily the brightest object in the sky unless there's
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:31.520]   like a full moon.
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:34.640]   But you have to know where to look, especially if you're setting up your camera.
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:39.760]   So if you already know that the ISS is coming, this is the thing to keep keep next to you
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.320]   on the sofa as you're waiting for the time to actually go outside and start peeping up
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.920]   to keep peeping up in the sky.
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:51.160]   NASA actually has another calculator that will tell you what time to what times it's
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:53.360]   going to be passing overhead based on your location.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:55.480]   You can also send you email alerts.
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:59.880]   But this is also cool because not only does it have this live view, but also you can actually
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:02.440]   set hit this.
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:03.440]   Oops.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:08.000]   Hit this one right here and it will actually show you here all the times that it's about
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.320]   that's going to be passing overhead along with like a one to four star rating as to how
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:15.360]   good that viewing is going to be.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.360]   So here's the elevate.
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:20.360]   So yeah, more information, but let's get back to there.
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:23.760]   Once again, I'm not trained on operating my iPhone upside down.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.960]   I don't blame you.
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:28.480]   I'm using crane camp three thousand future video podcasts, which has many great benefits,
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.480]   but not but upside down.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:32.160]   You need a mirror or something to exactly.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:35.160]   Yeah, I need a vocal array.
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:36.760]   But yeah, so so it's easy to see that.
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:39.400]   Oh, well, actually here are one stars, which means that they're not going to be in the
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:40.400]   sky for very long.
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.360]   Plus, they're going to be low, low on the horizon.
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:44.200]   So you might not you might be able to see it.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:48.560]   The other money money feature is that you can actually set an alarm.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:52.680]   So if you go into preferences, you can actually tell it.
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:55.160]   Please you can tell it to.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.680]   There we go.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:02.680]   You can tell it anytime the ISS is going to be at least this far above the horizon.
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:06.040]   So long since going to be within some time of the day, I'm going to be actually awake
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:10.600]   and looking up or only at nights will be easier to see outside of the outside of the sunset
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:11.600]   or whatever.
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:12.800]   Actually, give me an alert.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:13.800]   Give me an alarm.
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:17.120]   So you'll actually like, you know, get a notification on your Apple watch that, hey, in five minutes
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:21.600]   or a 10 minutes time, go into the backyard because there's a spaceship visible that you're
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:22.800]   going to be able to see.
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:25.360]   So and all this and this is a free app.
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:29.440]   There's in app purchases where if you want to give them a buck or three bucks, they're
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:31.680]   perfectly happy to let you do that.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.080]   But man, it's a uni tasker app.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.680]   It does that one thing perfectly well in both nights over this weekend where I really wanted
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:40.680]   to get good photos of the ISS.
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:46.080]   It was so easy because I had this app just like at my hip pocket at all times beautifully,
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.080]   beautifully made.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:49.280]   What's the name of it?
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.280]   ISS.
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:54.360]   It's called ISS spotter spot by media pilot.
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:55.640]   And I go, thank you.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:58.600]   My pick of the week is just by a share of Apple stock.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.360]   You'll thank yourself later.
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:01.360]   Apple.
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.720]   I'm not actually joking.
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:08.600]   We are not allowed to give you stock advice because I'm not anyway, because I'm an idiot.
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.360]   But Apple has lost every week.
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:16.440]   A billion dollars in value in the last two days.
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:19.640]   And while I don't understand any of this, apparently it broke through a technical support
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:20.640]   level.
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:27.840]   So it's expected by stock nerds to go lower still, maybe down to 110 or less.
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.880]   And of course, as anybody watches this show knows, Apple had the best quarter it's ever
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:34.840]   had every quarter for the last 10 years.
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.640]   So you didn't someone show a graph?
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:40.320]   This says it doesn't matter that Apple's price goes up and then down and then up and
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:42.560]   then down regardless of what's happening in the rest of the world.
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:43.560]   Isn't it bizarre?
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.920]   Well, I think it's a frightening pattern.
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:49.400]   I think that I think one of the things that Apple has done fairly effectively is every
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:51.840]   time their stock drops by a lot, they do a lot of buyback.
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.840]   Yeah, this is a chance, right?
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:53.840]   You know, which chance, right?
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:56.720]   But it also, it gives Apple a big discount and slowly buying their stock.
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:01.400]   I have to think that Apple's long-term future is bright.
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:07.600]   And if you could get Apple stock, which peaked just a few days ago at 132 bucks per share,
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:12.200]   if you'd get it $110 per share, it seems like that would be a good idea.
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.680]   But I'm not giving you stock advice.
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:20.240]   And I certainly don't own any Apple stock because I don't buy tech stocks for many very
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.760]   good reasons.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:26.680]   My pick of the week this week, blab.im, we talked about it and Playfect showed it a
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:29.800]   little bit before the show.
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:33.120]   This is a really interesting idea.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:39.720]   Comes from some of the developers and people behind BBO, I remember BBO sold to AOL for
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.440]   a lot, almost a billion dollars.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.840]   And then AOL sold it back to the founders.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.320]   BBO was a messaging system that was very popular around the world, but never really,
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:50.360]   it kind of got subsumed by what's happened.
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.440]   Others, they've changed a little bit.
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.680]   And now they're doing something using a technology.
[01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:59.240]   Alex has talked a lot about called WebRTC.
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:07.480]   I liken this to much like Meerkat and Periscope, but like Hangouts.
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:10.560]   So you can have up to four people in a frame, you can all talk.
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.080]   It's really incredibly easy.
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.560]   I wonder if there's, yeah, they're still going.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.240]   I started this.
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:18.880]   There they are before the show.
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:22.360]   And they're still going, let me join in on this one.
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:23.360]   You see how easy it is.
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:24.360]   I'm going to reject this call.
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:25.800]   Oh, don't reject me, Brittany.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:26.800]   Please.
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:27.800]   All right.
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:28.800]   Now I'm in the blab.
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:31.520]   The only thing about this is you've got a chat room going.
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:34.480]   Actually, it's on the left here as we look.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.480]   Did you just move that?
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:36.480]   It used to be on the right.
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.000]   Oh, are you mirror flipped again?
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.680]   I'm mirror flipped again.
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:43.480]   And it's easy for people to join it.
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:46.600]   There's this kind of nice feature where if you like what somebody's saying, you click
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:48.440]   the hands to give them feels.
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:53.080]   Anybody who's used Periscope will recognize this feature.
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:55.160]   And it's free and it's easy to use.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:56.520]   It's at blab.im.
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:59.600]   They've released a beta version of it for iOS, for iPhone.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:02.160]   I shouldn't say iOS, for iPhone.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:08.120]   The way you get the beta version on the iPhone is you go to blab.im in your browser and you'll
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:09.920]   get to download it.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:12.240]   And I find this fascinating.
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:14.480]   How many do you know Brittany works for the company?
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:16.640]   Do you know how many shows there have been?
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:18.840]   I mean, you only launched this a few months ago.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.280]   Percon, but how many shows exactly?
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:24.280]   But it's lots.
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:26.760]   Yeah, it's been pretty active.
[01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:30.000]   We haven't found a time where there's nothing on air right now.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.440]   And it's really great.
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:37.320]   Our whole community, we have founders of over 2000 startups who occasionally jump in.
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:40.720]   And there's moments like how you found out when someone just tweeted.
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:42.680]   Someone tweeted and I went in and I went, whoa.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:45.200]   Well, what kind of guy just clicks the links?
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:46.200]   Someone tweeted them.
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:47.200]   We're like, this guy.
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.200]   That guy.
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:50.200]   Anyway, very interesting.
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:58.320]   And I feel like in some ways it really democratizes what we do, which is the multi-headed talking
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:01.320]   heads chat show so that anybody could do one.
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:02.720]   I really like this.
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:07.080]   Sean just jumped in and said there's about 200 blabs a day.
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:08.560]   200 blabs a day.
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:11.000]   I think that might go up very quickly, very soon.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.840]   Oh, that would be wonderful.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:15.000]   Our servers are up for the challenge.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000]   Alex, tell me.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.880]   By the way, Alex thought you might be using Amazon.
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:19.880]   Is that correct?
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:20.880]   The Amazon cloud.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:23.080]   I think that's not correct.
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:24.080]   Oh, OK.
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:25.080]   No, no.
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:27.000]   And I said, you could do it with Amazon.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.680]   I'm not saying you need to.
[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:30.880]   So as far from a broadcasting.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:32.720]   Everybody, Jay just calling in.
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:35.280]   This is-- oh, cool.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:36.280]   El.
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:38.480]   JJ McCool.
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:41.440]   So this is kind of an interesting-- I really think this is fascinating.
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:46.160]   I feel like-- now Alex, WebRTC is a Google technology.
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:48.720]   It's free and open to use, right?
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:50.320]   Yeah, I don't know if it's-- yeah, there's
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:51.800]   been a lot of people that contribute to it.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.080]   But it's an open-- it's a very open platform
[01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:57.400]   that allows folks to really design what you're seeing there,
[01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.760]   where you don't have to design all the underlying connections
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:01.360]   that it's being supported by Chrome.
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:02.920]   It's supported on Chrome and Firefox.
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:05.440]   Is it-- I don't know if it's supported on Safari or not.
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:08.160]   It is not working on Safari because Safari doesn't support
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:09.080]   WebRTC.
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:09.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:11.920]   That's Firefox and Chrome both do.
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:15.920]   Yeah, and so it allows point-to-point connections
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.520]   that are very, very low latency, high quality.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:20.960]   And so by being supported directly into the browser,
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:23.200]   it just makes it really easy to build these kinds of-- not
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:23.720]   easy.
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:26.040]   I mean, there's lots of things about it that are hard.
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:29.960]   But it definitely makes it more fluid as far as creating
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:33.720]   these kind of protocols that don't require plug-ins, that
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.120]   don't require a lot of extra stuff to make it work.
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:38.160]   You could-- this couldn't be easier.
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:42.200]   It's very much like the onboarding of Mircat or Periscope.
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:44.960]   You just go to Blabdye.im.
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:49.320]   That, by the way, is Sean Puri is the CEO of the company.
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:51.400]   He's joined us in the lower left.
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:52.880]   You go to Blabdye.im.
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:55.000]   You feed it your Twitter login.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.040]   You give it an email address.
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:57.160]   And then you're-- that's it.
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:57.920]   You're done.
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:59.280]   You can also tweet.
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:01.960]   It's very much like Periscope or Mircat.
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:05.440]   I feel like more like Mircat really feels guerrilla and fun.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.960]   And boy, you could see how well it works.
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:08.200]   This is kind of amazing.
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.440]   Yeah, our CTO is actually jumping in the comments,
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:13.040]   and he said we use AWS and our own data center.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:14.040]   It is Amazon.
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:15.480]   And plus your own data center.
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:16.480]   OK.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:16.980]   OK.
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:17.920]   Very cool.
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:23.720]   So blab.im if you're interested in trying it out.
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:26.920]   This is kind of against my own better interest,
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:30.160]   since it after all does exactly what we spent a million
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:34.680]   and a half dollars to do here in the studio on your laptop
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.360]   or your phone.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:38.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:40.640]   The competitive advantage is not the technology.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:42.040]   Better advantage is you.
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:42.720]   It's everything.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:43.560]   Oh, good.
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:44.560]   Oh, OK.
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:45.880]   You got the million dollar voice.
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:47.160]   Actually, I want to play with this.
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:48.840]   I think I could see us using it.
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:52.040]   Just as we use Hangouts sometimes, I could see us using it.
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:54.840]   Alex, you're the king of Hangouts.
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:59.680]   Is this the same codec Alex as Hangouts uses and all of that?
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:00.520]   I think it's very similar.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:03.560]   I don't know precisely what everybody's using for this.
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:05.280]   But it's a very similar codec.
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:06.760]   And I think that probably the quality--
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:07.440]   I think one of the things--
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:08.080]   Look how good it looks.
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:09.240]   --it's control over it.
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:09.520]   Yeah.
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:11.000]   So I think that they--
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.720]   a lot of that stuff can be switched on the back end
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:14.440]   if they wanted to provide more quality.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:14.640]   I have a problem.
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:15.000]   That's right.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.080]   Isn't it for Quantum and Sean?
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:18.160]   You guys could turn up--
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.720]   in fact, you might want to think about doing a pro version
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:22.920]   where you could dial up the quality a little bit,
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.640]   given that you would know what kind of bandwidth
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:26.320]   individual users would have.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:27.080]   Right.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:30.000]   I mean, the cool thing is what you did with Twitch,
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.520]   which was no TV station could ever
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:35.640]   cover technology and the depth and breadth that you do.
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:37.480]   Or would want to, apparently.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:39.080]   Well, but there is an audience for it, right?
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:40.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:42.040]   I gave our team this example.
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:45.800]   I said, Amazon sells more books than Barge and Noble ever
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:45.800]   carry.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:46.800]   It's a long tail.
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:47.440]   Carry, right?
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:48.920]   The long tail is extremely powerful.
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:53.000]   And I said, whether it's sports or it's finance,
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.200]   there are content junkies out there who can't get enough.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:58.720]   And who knows where the great talent's going to come up from?
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:00.160]   We don't need to decide top down.
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.840]   Let's let the talent bubble up to the top.
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:04.040]   And let's let people create little talk
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:05.960]   shows about what they are interested in.
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:08.240]   And democracy, I think, you said a little bit earlier.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:08.960]   That's the right word.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:09.880]   It's about--
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:10.400]   It does.
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.400]   I tried it on the iPad.
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:13.800]   Does it work on the iPad?
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:15.800]   Yeah, the iOS app will work on the iPad.
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:16.080]   OK.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:18.120]   So you can do this on iPad or iPhone,
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.040]   blab.im if you wanted to install it and play with it.
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.480]   And I expect a million shows to bloom.
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:26.320]   Thank you, Brittany and Sean.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.440]   I appreciate it.
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:28.760]   Yeah, thanks for jumping in.
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:33.880]   @ferkmon who's on the left there in the Twitter chat.
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:34.640]   I don't know if you noticed.
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:37.400]   Your after show's been going on for two hours.
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:41.680]   I was showing the website and said, oh, they're still doing it.
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.920]   So we went-- we just joined.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:43.880]   Brittany took it over.
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:45.000]   That's another interesting thing.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.320]   It's easy to add people and have people leave.
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:49.560]   You just click the X in the box or boot people,
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:54.600]   although I noticed because it's Brittany's only she can boot.
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:56.760]   Apparently, when I left, you were able to take it over.
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.840]   But Brittany, is that because you work at Blab,
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:01.160]   or would that be just how it works in general?
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:03.240]   Oh, I had to start a new Blab.
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:04.520]   You started a new Blab, OK?
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:05.200]   Yeah.
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:07.880]   People can squat in it, but you can kick them out to make sure.
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:09.000]   Yeah.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.400]   So very interesting.
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:11.080]   Blab.im.
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:13.120]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:16.520]   Sean, Brittany, you're on in the chat there.
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:18.480]   Thank you, JJ McCool.
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:20.400]   We are now even, right?
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:20.920]   I know.
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:22.520]   I think we are finally even.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:25.080]   Because I invaded his Blab yesterday.
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:26.520]   I'm going to come in your Blab tonight.
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:27.520]   You watch.
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:29.760]   We've got a bunch of them for you.
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.080]   We had a couple of tweets saying,
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:32.720]   can Blab handle the Twitter army?
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.200]   So we'll see if Twitter nation overloads us,
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.560]   or if we can handle it.
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:39.000]   I think you guys have some servers on demand there,
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.520]   because it seems to be rock solid.
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:43.200]   We tend to break stuff.
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:45.800]   We've always wanted to helicopter in servers.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:46.160]   So--
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:48.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:48.720]   --that we want to do.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.160]   Thanks, guys.
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.520]   See you later.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:51.160]   Bye-bye.
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:51.880]   Bye-bye.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:53.440]   So that's my pick of the week.
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:55.240]   Kind of an interesting idea, I think.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.960]   See, I left, so my seat is now open.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:58.160]   And I can continue to watch.
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:01.040]   And that's the other point is people can continue to watch
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:03.200]   as it continues.
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:04.440]   I like that t-shirt.
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:06.600]   Those hands mean I feel you.
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:07.560]   I feel you.
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.160]   Alex Lindsay, he's at the Pixel Core.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:10.880]   You're going to be back next week, I hear.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.600]   I will via Rwanda.
[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:13.720]   I'll be in Rwanda next week.
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:14.720]   Oh, nice.
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.080]   So we'll show you whatever is new there when we get there.
[02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:19.840]   Very nice.
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:21.440]   Look forward to that.
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:21.920]   Yeah.
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:24.040]   So next week for Rwanda.
[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:26.080]   And most likely, if people are following me,
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:28.880]   I'm known to Miraket from Rwanda.
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:30.320]   And I probably will do that again.
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.520]   I don't Miraket a lot of times.
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.440]   When I'm here in the United States,
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:34.120]   most of my life is an NDA.
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:36.480]   Except when I'm on the show.
[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:38.560]   But in Rwanda, usually I can put the--
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:40.840]   I'm going to be attaching a phone to the car
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:42.160]   and driving around and stuff like that.
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.040]   So it should be fun.
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:44.440]   We should mention, by the way-- and this
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:49.480]   seems to be going on right now-- that there is a cell outage
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:52.360]   in much of the United States, AT&T and T-Mobile,
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:56.120]   both are suffering outages right now.
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:06:01.200]   So anybody that AT&T in the audience, is it working?
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:03.640]   You see in bars?
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:05.040]   Something to be aware of.
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:06.640]   And I have both AT&T and T-Antimable.
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:07.800]   So in Pittsburgh, it seems to be fine.
[02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:08.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:09.680]   And there's hail in New England.
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:11.440]   So I keep looking up, making sure Andy's OK.
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:12.480]   I left my--
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:12.960]   You wait a minute.
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:14.720]   You got hail in July?
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:17.560]   We've had some really bad-- we've had some tornadoes.
[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:21.440]   There was a huge storm that took out a whole bunch of cities
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.880]   in the power in Northern Rhode Island.
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:25.640]   A couple of people got killed in New Hampshire
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:28.840]   with a tent collapse because of a storm over the weekend.
[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:29.440]   Really bad.
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:31.240]   Actually, to expand this, it apparently
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:33.680]   is not just AT&T and T-Mobile.
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:36.520]   It's all wireless, all the big wireless carries.
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:38.960]   In the US, Verizon is also suffering at this point.
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:39.600]   That worries me.
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:40.240]   Is this a hack?
[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:41.040]   Or is it a--
[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:44.040]   Well, Cali, do they all use the same backbone?
[02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:45.760]   I don't know.
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:46.800]   We're a--
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.040]   Soundsbot.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.760]   Yeah.
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:53.040]   Nature is getting cranky.
[02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:56.280]   There's Verizon's outage.
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:58.680]   That's kind of limited to the southeast,
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:01.600]   although Los Angeles suffering a little bit.
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:04.360]   AT&T's same area.
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:06.720]   Interesting, isn't that?
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:07.960]   AT&T's spreading.
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:15.040]   That is a little scary.
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:18.680]   Coordinated fiber cuts could do it.
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:21.560]   Pretty hard to do that in software, I think.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:24.240]   The fact that those are in geographically similar regions.
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:31.680]   We'll continue to cover that story, of course,
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:32.400]   through the day.
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:33.640]   In fact, security now is coming up.
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:36.400]   I wouldn't be surprised if Steve will be on this as well.
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:38.880]   Thank you, Mr. Andy and not co-Chicago.
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:42.720]   Sometimes he's in a hail of a place.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:44.280]   New England.
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.840]   It's good to be indoors, Leo.
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:48.000]   It's very good to be indoors.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.880]   Oh, outside, it's not a safe place for milk toast,
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:52.160]   such as myself.
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.760]   And well, not to mention that big, bright fusion ball
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:55.680]   up in the sky there.
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:56.200]   That thing's scary.
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:57.200]   Stupid day ball.
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:58.960]   I hate that day ball.
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:04.720]   Renee Ritchie, he's balmy and relaxed in beautiful mojail.
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:07.480]   Where the meat is smoked and the women are beautiful.
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.640]   Absolutely.
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:10.000]   Thank you, Renee, for joining us.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:10.960]   We appreciate it.
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:11.560]   Thank you, Leo.
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:12.480]   All right.
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:13.600]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:17.280]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM

[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:26.640]   We love having you.
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:27.960]   And a nice studio audience today.
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:28.840]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:29.920]   I appreciate it.
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:31.600]   You can also get it after the fact.
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:34.080]   Of course, on demand always for all of our shows.
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:37.840]   In this case, twit.tv/mbw or wherever you subscribe

[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:42.320]   We're on all the platforms, including, of course, iTunes,

[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:46.240]   And a variety of really excellent Twit apps written
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:50.840]   by our third party developers on every platform, iOS,
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:53.480]   Android, Windows, phone.
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:54.440]   Thanks for being here now.
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:58.240]   Back to work because break time is over.
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:01.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:04.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:07.220]   (upbeat music)
[02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:09.640]   (rock music)
