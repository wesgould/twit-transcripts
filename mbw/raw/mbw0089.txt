[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.800]   Oh, wait a minute, somebody's calling.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   I hear a phone.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200]   I hear a bird.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.000]   >> Yes, that would probably be the bird that sounds like an electronic phone.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500]   They've been doing a call and response for the past 20 minutes.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.900]   >> You know, the bird came back by request, didn't he?
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.200]   >> Yes, well, you know, fortunately he wasn't tied up with any of the competing Mac podcasts.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.800]   I've got him just on a proprietary six episode deal with an option towards another season.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.400]   >> Excellent.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.900]   Well, we're so glad he could join us.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.000]   And we're so glad you could join us.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.200]   Thank you Andy and not go from the Chicago Sun times and the celestial energy.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.600]   I'd always rather have you.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.300]   >> I apologize for the late start everybody.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.400]   We are live on Twit Live and we are on our new servers.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.700]   So we'll see how that works out.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.000]   Also, as you can see those of you who are watching the video to my right, the lovely Justine Azerik.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hi Justine.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.500]   >> Hi.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500]   >> When's the last time you were on Mac Break Weekly?
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.000]   Long time.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.600]   >> I didn't spend a while.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.100]   >> Months.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.100]   >> Welcome back.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.600]   >> Thank you.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   >> To see you in person is so great.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.500]   Alex Lindsey is also here to my right.
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.000]   >> I am.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And we're well caffeinated.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.800]   >> We are.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.000]   >> You had plenty of time to caffeinate.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.400]   >> We stopped at Dr. Insomnias on the way here.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   That's the greatest place.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   >> I love it.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400]   >> It's in the Vato.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.600]   >> It's in the Vato on the way here.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.560]   So I may want to come up to the Twitch cottage.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.400]   You could stop and get caffeinated halfway.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.400]   >> Exactly.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   >> We also welcome everybody watching on Twit Live at TwitLive.tv.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.840]   And they want to know if Justine if you're going to be doing any video.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.160]   Do you still do the live cast thing?
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.760]   >> I got quick right here.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760]   I can't even you know.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.920]   >> So at some point you could quick this.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920]   >> Can.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920]   >> Do you like quick?
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   You get your N95.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   >> I love it.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.640]   I don't really like doing the 24/7 thing but there's these moments that you can only capture
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.640]   with this.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.640]   >> That you want to get.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.840]   >> Like on the way here, well actually yesterday when I got my flight in the shuttle, there
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.280]   was this guy who was playing this ridiculous Indian music and I was able to share that
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   with everyone.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280]   Because I'm quick.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.120]   And no one had any idea what's going on.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120]   They're like, "Where is she?
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.120]   Did she get captured?"
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.560]   >> We're watching Bollywood.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.720]   Justine goes Bollywood.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.320]   Have you ever done quick Andy?
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.920]   >> I have the hardware.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.040]   The guy said quick, sent me the hardware and I've been trying to get it set up for me.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.280]   It's not quick fault.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.040]   It's just that I have not really had time to dive into a box and get a new thing working.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.600]   But I really want to try it because I feel as though if there are parts of my life that
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.400]   are going undocumented that I'm just not trying hard enough.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.960]   This is 2008 after all.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.800]   I'm actually like it's 2006 for God's sakes.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.280]   Who am I?
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.240]   >> Hey let me add Merlin Mann into the conversation because I guess Merlin has found the time.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.800]   I apologize for our late start, Merlin.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   >> Not at all.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   >> Good to have you back.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   >> Thank you very much.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   >> Mr. Merlin Mann from 40 for the folders and the brand new You Look Marvelous podcast.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.760]   What is it called?
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.040]   Is it sick and has a temperature?
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.520]   What is it called?
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.760]   You look funny tonight.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.920]   >> Yes, yes, yes.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.640]   You look delicious this morning.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   >> Why?
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.160]   I remember it from the acronym.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   Y-L-N-T.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.160]   >> Yes.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.680]   >> You look nice today.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680]   .com.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.160]   >> Yes, thank you very much.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.360]   You're nice to mention that.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.240]   >> I've got to give you something.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.840]   I can't give you coffee and Diet Coke is out.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.440]   I told Dane, "Stuck up on Diet Coke."
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.040]   I know Alex likes it, but I think all geeks drink Diet Coke.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   >> It is.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.440]   >> For Andy, we know Andy you will have sugar Coke when you come.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.000]   >> When I'm out of the house, I'm allowed to have sugar Coke.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.840]   If it's inside the house, that would be a bad thing, but I will have to open it.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.640]   >> Just you must know what sugar sugar Coke is.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.720]   >> Why would you think like- >> You take a teaspoon of sugar and you put it into the
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   Coke?
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.720]   >> I don't do that.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   >> You have a filled Coke.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720]   >> Are you one of those?
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   What does add some sugar?
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.520]   I do still have some Passover Coke in the house, which I'm saving.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.520]   I have two more bottles left after ration them for the next two weeks.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.440]   >> Okay, I'm going to add, look stupid.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.760]   What is that Passover Coke?
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   Is that something?
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   >> Passover Coke.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   >> Passover Coke.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.840]   >> Okay, well, the ultimate advantage of it is- >> You have to put some of it on the door
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.600]   frame so that the Lord will pass over.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.560]   You just have to rub a little on the door frame.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.480]   >> I had a print of Passover Coke over the door frame.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.520]   The ultimate, the Coca-Cola experience is to be in Central America and buy a glass bottle
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.560]   of Coke there because they produce it with real cane sugar and not corn syrup down there.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   When I was on the geek cruises in Central America, I would always come back, return to
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.040]   the ship after a day-long excursion with a backpack that was clanking audibly because
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.840]   I had to, it's the best, best, best Coke out there.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:16.320]   Second best is Passover Coke because for certain reasons, there's a Coke made with corn syrup
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.600]   is not kosher for Passover.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.480]   So, rabbis, actually, so local bottlers in certain markets, including Boston, will actually
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.320]   produce a short run of Coca-Cola made with either beet sugar or cane sugar, right?
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.200]   It has a special, all Coke is kosher.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.480]   It has that special K logo on it, but this is like super kosher.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.440]   This is like, I'm not, okay, as a Catholic, I probably should not be talking about what
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.240]   the difference between flavors of kosher is.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.120]   I only know about kosherness as applies to Coke, something that's a fortune to profit
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.520]   but, study, special yellow cap, it's been like double kosher-ified and it's only available
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.120]   for about three or four weeks.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.240]   And so, I buy like about six, two liter bottles.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.800]   I marshall, you have to drink them before they start to go off on you because freshness
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.960]   does count.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.200]   That's why if you go to like Bodega's, that's specialized in Mexican food, Central American
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.000]   food, South American foods, you can find a little display, a little refrigerator case
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   in the back of most Bodegas that will have a few bottles of, again, Mexican Coke and
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Mexican Pepsi's.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.120]   The costco's have that now.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120]   You can get Mexican Coke.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.480]   Costco actually especially important.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.320]   The problem is that if it's imported from Mexico, you don't know how old it is.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.400]   You also don't know how much time the Coke has spent in the back of an overheated truck.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.960]   It's really, really, really running a bad risk.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.320]   Believe it or not, people expect that I drink nothing but these Bodega or Costco Coke's.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.600]   And really, I would much rather have a freshly produced corn syrup.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.560]   And I thought I was serious about my diet coke.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.240]   I mean, I've just been left in the dust.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.160]   I mean, I buy most of my soda from eBay.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.160]   I mean, I don't even mess around.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.160]   This is crack.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   You buy soda on eBay.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.160]   No, I'm betting.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   I'm joking.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.160]   I believe everything that is effective.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   I've not used Coke.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.320]   I thought you used Coke on eBay.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.320]   It's not that bad.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   You just make sure it's clean.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   Check the reputation of the people.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.920]   It's pretty, it's actually not used diapers also.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   You can get those.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.160]   You don't want to spend a lot of money on that stuff because you're just going to throw
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.920]   it away unless you sell it again.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.040]   A plus plus plus would drink again.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   [laughter]
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   Would poop again.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.880]   All right, let's talk a little bit about Macintosh.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.960]   It is Mac Break Weekly.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.240]   Although, frankly, I think that might be the most interesting rat hole ever.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.920]   Certainly the weirdest one ever.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.600]   And I have learned something here.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.160]   And you know, we're going to stock up on our Eve Coke just for you, Andy, from now on.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160]   We'll have--
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   God bless you.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.120]   When you come to town, we'll have that kosher Coke just for you.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.440]   So we want to talk a little bit about WWDC.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.320]   We now know that Steve Jobs will be keynoting.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.400]   Oh, what a shock surprise.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.240]   I can't believe they made a news story out of that.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.240]   Well, sometimes he doesn't.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   Sometimes he doesn't.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.240]   I don't know if he did last year.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.240]   He's done every year.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.240]   I haven't remembered yet.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.240]   Surprising.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.240]   Steve Jobs would keynote.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   Keynote.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.240]   I knew.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   Give a speech.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.240]   You think he'll--
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.240]   Well, it's pretty much the middle of the year.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   You have the beginning of the year keynote and the middle of the year keynote.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.720]   He doesn't really do a lot outside.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:05.680]   I mean, as far as the-- they've kind of-- since they don't really do the summer Mac world anymore,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.920]   this is kind of his opportunity to do the middle of the year.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.440]   June 9th, he will be giving the big keynote Monday, 10 AM.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440]   I guess we'll be there.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.360]   Somebody will be there from the Mac break team.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   Somebody.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   To cover it.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   Yes.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.000]   And then what is he going to say?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.760]   We would assume that he's going to say that we all get new phones.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.040]   You know, we talked last week about the fact that the iPhone was out of stock.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.600]   Did we talk-- maybe we talked on Twitter about that.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   Yeah, there was.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.640]   Because it hadn't happened yet.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.200]   But you can't order the iPhone online, which seems to me to be both a signal that the new
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.960]   phone's coming along and a huge mistake because the new phone-- can it be ready?
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.720]   Well, it could be a huge mistake.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.400]   It could also be avoiding all these people who want to bring it back for 30.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.680]   You know, if you stop the $100 available for 30 days, you know, then people are going
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.680]   to come back and say, you know, they're all kind of saying, "I want to switch this phone
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   out for a new one."
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.760]   So it may or may not be a bad idea.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.120]   Well, I know somebody said that they actually just recently dropped their phone in the toilet.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.360]   So they were extremely upset because they wanted to order another one online.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.360]   And they couldn't get a new one.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   They couldn't get a new one.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   Like, well, it's currently unavailable.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   It's currently unavailable.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.120]   Checking again, the store currently unavailable.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   Well, it's probably a bad idea just because the new iPhone is a big enough media event
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.280]   that they should really have a special event just for that so they can get the entire news
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.480]   cycle.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.200]   If they're doing the developer stuff plus the iPhones stuff plus other stuff, I'm not
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.880]   sure that's the best way for Apple to maintain their resources there.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.600]   Here's my question.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.360]   And maybe, correct me if I'm wrong, but don't we still have to go through FCC approval?
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.920]   Is this going to be one of those things where the—because we haven't heard anything about
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.960]   the FCC looking at 3G iPhones?
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   I don't think we do.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   Or is it just a slight iteration?
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.760]   Yeah, I don't think that we have to.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.760]   It's a new radio.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.680]   I don't think that they have to though.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.800]   They may have already done it too.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.360]   The thing is that you don't have to do that publicly.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   Oh, you don't?
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   No.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.120]   So that whole rationale for him announcing the iPhone at Macworld in January, but shipping
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.120]   in June last year.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.200]   Well, but now that the gig is up, you could let the FCC approval come out earlier late.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.400]   What they're afraid of is that it would leak out of the FCC once it went into the system.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.480]   And so now that you already know the iPhone, that there is an iPhone—
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480]   I guess it's not really a secret.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.640]   There's a 3G iPhone.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.640]   Everybody knows that.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.640]   That's going to happen.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.640]   It's just a matter of—
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.440]   I mean, AT&T said that at the end of the year.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.120]   So clearly, he's going to announce a 3G iPhone.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.280]   I saw an interesting rumor.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.120]   I don't know if I buy this from the French Le Métat.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:34.200]   They say that the iPhone, the new iPhone will come with GPS, video conferencing, and mobile
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   TV.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.440]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.960]   GPS, for sure, right?
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.280]   Possibly, yeah.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.600]   I think GPS is—I mean, I really want it badly.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   I think GSM is for sure.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.600]   What's wrong with that?
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   I mean, why don't you like it?
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.720]   GPS is so expensive in so many ways.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:57.360]   I wouldn't figure on GPS being built in unless there was some really easy way to turn it
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.400]   on, turn it off, and make sure that it would work almost instantly when you turn it back
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.800]   on again.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.360]   I'm not saying that I think that it's a stupid idea and I think that will not happen.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.880]   I just think that I'd be very surprised.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.320]   If I have money on it, I would be betting against it.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   I have to say—
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.160]   I'd be betting more on an external Bluetooth GPS that works really, really well with the
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.320]   iPhone as opposed to GPS built in.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.320]   I think that's a better solution.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.320]   To me, that's a better solution, too.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.120]   I'm looking at what's in front of Justine.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.120]   She's got her iPhone.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.720]   She's got her N95, which has GPS in it.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.760]   She also has her Sprint Evdocar.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.080]   One of the problems with the N95 is you turn on the Wi-Fi, you turn on the Bluetooth,
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.080]   and then you turn on GPS.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.760]   Your battery is dead within five minutes.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.240]   I have been using a little—I bought a watch fob.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.000]   It's a geotracker, so while I take photos, it'll geotrack, but I can also use it on my
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   blackberry.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.320]   I turn on my blackberry and open Google Maps and it says, "Oh, you want to attach to this
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.720]   GPS, this Bluetooth GPS device?
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   You've got hanging on your belt."
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Which one is that?
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   Anyone will do it.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.280]   All these GPS trackers.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.900]   All the little dongles that have no interface that are Bluetooth, what's neat is Google
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.900]   Maps sees it.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.200]   You don't have to buy an additional software, Google Maps knows everywhere.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.760]   You work on your laptop as well.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   That's a good question.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   I don't know.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.320]   It works on my blackberry.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.280]   The beauty is it does not kill the blackberry's battery at all.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.280]   I think it's completely—
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.280]   I think it's a good solution.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.280]   I think it's a good solution.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   I think it's important.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.640]   I think that the mobile TV stuff seems like it would be obvious if you're going to have
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.280]   an up bandwidth other than we'll be using up all of AT&T's bandwidth, which is—
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.760]   You saw that orb announced that it's going to do a— I like orb.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.120]   Do you know about orb?
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:38.960]   Orb is the idea that you can have video or photos or music or whatever on your home PC
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.920]   and then you put a little orb client on a variety of devices and you can watch it,
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.120]   but they have just announced an iPhone client.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.840]   Now you have to crack your iPhone.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   For now.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.840]   I love that.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.840]   I won't do it.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.840]   I can't.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.200]   Stephen, he really doesn't want me to.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   I know he doesn't.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200]   I see.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   I just—
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.200]   It's a Steve thing.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   You know, I don't want him to think that I'm cheating on him or anything.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   Ballmer jobs.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   I—
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   Which, Stephen?
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   Yes, of course.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.560]   You do everything just because Stephen tells you to.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.560]   What's that?
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.560]   He says, "Do you do everything?"
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.560]   Stephen says so.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   Yes, I do, actually.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.960]   You want to make—you want to make some of a lifetime made for TV movie.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.320]   Meredith Baxter-Bernie could be playing you.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   She's cuter than Meredith Baxter-Bernie.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.320]   I'm not without my open source.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:28.480]   I mean, one of the regular complaints that you hear from people, even from fans of the
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.440]   iPhone, has to do with battery life, though.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.840]   That's something that, you know, all systems go down when the battery dies.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.080]   So I mean, I'm not sure—I don't know.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.960]   Personally, I'm not sure I see—if GPS is going to be the power sucker that everybody
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.400]   says it is, I'm just not sure how many new people that brings to the iPhone.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.760]   Three G's of power sucker.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.920]   In fact, did you see the—they—they—Apple accidentally leaked in its developer kit.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.720]   The interface where you say, "Check this box.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   Turn off three G."
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.720]   You know, because it will cut your battery life significantly.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.360]   I mean, I can't remember the exact wording, but Apple's going to be telling people that.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.600]   Well, I know—and we talked about this earlier, but, you know, I didn't realize that I had
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.640]   this thing that, "Well, my iPhone lasts three or four days."
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.240]   And someone was asking me how that's possible, and I realized I turn off Wi-Fi all the time.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.880]   So any time I walk out of the office, I turn off the Wi-Fi, and the Wi-Fi makes a huge
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.880]   difference in the word.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.840]   Turn off the Wi-Fi and the auto email check.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   And it's a significant—
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.800]   I had for a while just for fun when I was traveling.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.080]   I had my email auto checking once an hour, and it was mind-blowing.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.560]   I mean, by 5 p.m., I was down to—you know how it is on the iPhone where everything
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.400]   seems fine, and then suddenly you have no battery left, and you're like, "What
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.400]   would happen?"
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   You know, absolutely.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.400]   You know, I do that really.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.640]   This is a little bit of a rat hole, but on flights, if you're using your Mac.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.840]   Man, turn off Bluetooth, turn off the airport searching.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.040]   I mean, it's a huge, huge time battery sucker.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.680]   I recently just got a Mophie Juice pack, which I've been a huge fan of.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.360]   And we had that—we recorded one from Mac.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   Yeah, we did.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   We did a Mac break.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   What's a Mophie Juice pack?
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   Sounds delicious.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.720]   I'm really upset because I think I left one in my hotel, but it's just like a little
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.840]   sleeve that you put your oven in, and it just—
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.040]   A lot of companies are making those now.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   It's great.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.040]   Yeah, and that adds a lot more.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   So it's an extra battery, and it's a case with an extra battery.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.880]   And it's cool if it has the dock already built-ins, you can just plug into it.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   That's really cool.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.880]   It's awesome.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.880]   Mophie.com.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.880]   M-O-F-P-H-I-E.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.240]   I know a PH-I-E, that's right.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   It's well worth it.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   It's only like 100 bucks.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   There's an even cheaper one.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.880]   Somebody makes a $20 or $30 one.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.880]   Right.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.880]   With a lithium ion and everything.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.880]   So I mean, that's actually for the touch.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.880]   That's not for the phone.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.280]   But I do have to say, when I'm traveling, there are many times—like the Wi-Fi, you
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.640]   know, showing me where I am roughly, is cute, but I definitely would really love to have—
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   I want to know where I am.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.280]   I really want to know exactly where I am.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.680]   I loved that little—well, again, you have to crack your iPhone.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   You have to have an iPhone.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   Now, I'm just going to make a video about this.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   It's going to make a video about this.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   I'm going to make a video about this.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.680]   Did you see what Google Maps added?
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.680]   I think in the last day or two.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:43.680]   What?
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.680]   Wikipedia.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680]   They just added that yesterday.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   It's totally cool.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.680]   It sounds really weird, but it's really useful.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   Let's see.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   I was standing in front of a building that says
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   Boston Public Library, but some random dude on Wikipedia says
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.680]   it's actually the post office.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.680]   Well, I need to say it's the big fat butt building.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   What?
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   How would I do that?
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   I would go to, let's see.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.680]   We have a...
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.680]   We should see a more button.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   I'm going to Phoenix Theater in Petaluma because that's...
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   Well, do it back.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.680]   Do it the other way.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.680]   It's been on Wikipedia for a while, but if you go to
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680]   Maps...
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.680]   Oh, you go from Wikipedia.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.680]   No, no.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   I'm on maps.google.com.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.680]   And search for Petaluma.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.680]   Okay.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   I did.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   I found it.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.680]   Okay.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.680]   Now I'm looking...
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.680]   Now you see the more next to traffic, more.dot.dot.dot.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.680]   More info on the...
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   Oh, look at that.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   Oh, look at that.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.680]   And then it looks like it's doing a...
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   It's got more from mercurynews.com.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   It actually looks like it's doing a Google search.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.680]   What it'll do is, and on mine, I'm getting little W icons.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   Oh, I need a W icon.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680]   You pull back.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.680]   Well, you know, maybe it's not a Petaluma tricep.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   Maybe that's the problem.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   With all respect.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   Come on.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.680]   Everybody knows Petaluma.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.680]   But it's not a neat because you'll see stuff like you can click on,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   "Oh, there's the San Francisco Zoo," which is in my neighborhood,
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   and I can click on that, and there's information about the zoo,
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   and it takes your right to it.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.680]   I don't know.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.680]   Sorry, it's a rat hole.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680]   No, that's not a rat hole.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.680]   I think that's kind of neat.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.680]   Did you have you seen Power Set?
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   Have you guys played with Power Set a little bit?
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   No.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   It's funny because there's a little fight going on because Mike
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   Harrington, a tech crunch, said, "Oh, this is the greatest thing
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   since sliced bread," and people said, "What are you talking about?
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   Are they paying you?"
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   Power Set is a Wikipedia search tool that it gives you kind of
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.680]   interesting results.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   So let's give me an Andy Gimme something you'd like to know,
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.680]   something obscure, something out of your bizarre past.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.680]   Sinusoidal replanration, dingo lars, may be mounted on a base plate
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   so it pre-framulated an amylite.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.680]   How many wives did Henry the A's?
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.680]   How about Best Been Cloud City?
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   You can probably spell that one.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.680]   How many wives did Henry the 8 have?
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.680]   Okay.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.680]   He'll put the seventh.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   He didn't have any wives.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.680]   So what it actually does then is it pulls up Wikipedia articles
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.680]   with references in there.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   I think that's the kind of -- I mean, it's the same thing as
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   the Google Maps thing.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   Mashing up these disparate sources sometimes gives you
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   interesting results.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   It also shows you -- you know, there's a mnemonic for remembering.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   What's that?
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   How many has it go?
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.680]   Divorce beheaded, died, divorce beheaded, survived.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   And now do you know who wives are?
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.680]   Or do you just know that he divorced and beheaded?
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   Have you watched the show?
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.680]   The tutors.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   The tutors, baby.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.680]   Catherine of Erichl.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.680]   That's the hot Henry.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.680]   That's before you get -- that's about the hands holding Henry.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   That's about the history should be taught.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.680]   I learned about all the -- the only reason why I was able to impress
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.680]   my immediate history teacher with -- by knowing all the wives
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   that Henry had beheaded was because of the song with their
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   Ed tucked underneath their arm from Dr. Demento.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   So these kids are going to say, oh, okay, the first one had sort
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.680]   of misshapen boob.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.680]   The last one was a living yard to the other one.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.680]   The other one had a mole on her left buttocks.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   So that was the one -- that must have been Jade Seymour.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   It's pretty sexy, I have to say, but it's fun.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   I know it's really good.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.680]   Oh, my God.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.680]   The Henry guys exquisite.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.680]   That's the thing.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.680]   He's the cutest thing in there.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   He's a really good-looking.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   She looks a lot like the president from Battlestar Galactic.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.680]   Does anybody else think that?
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.680]   No.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   Moving on.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   We're going to run people in the side of the show.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   I think we're going to run people.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.680]   We should also warn people there are spoiler alerts here.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   If you're not familiar with --
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   If you have read English history, be careful.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.680]   Deforced, beheaded, died.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   I would love to see something like that Wikipedia.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   I love the little whatever that button is in the lower right hand corner that lets you drop the pin or change what you're looking at.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   You want map versus --
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   Wouldn't that be nice to integrate that with the show?
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   You're watching the tutors and you say, "Wait a minute.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   Hold on."
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   I actually had that -- I was listening to on -- I'm still listening to the Spartans.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   That's my second pass because the first time I just had to absorb all the names.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   I've got that on my list.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   That was one of the audible points.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   Right.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   I'm on my second pass now.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   What I really want is to see a map when it's talking about the Spartans.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   We're in the northern part or taking over the southern part.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   I really want to see a little map of where --
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   This was something like the Kindle has some potential because already with the Kindle you can highlight a line and then look up words on it.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   It will do a Wikipedia and a dictionary.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   As you get these smart devices and you get these mashups, I'm very excited.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   The idea is let's have information -- this is -- I hate to say it, but that's what Bill Gates was saying since day one.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   Information at your fingertips.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   That's the whole revolution that's here.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.680]   He didn't know about the Internet, of course.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:24.680]   One of the things you might like this, Merlin Man, HBO is finally selling shows on iTunes.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   Did you see that?
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   I thought you can buy the first season of the wire for $25, which is mind-blowing.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.680]   This is something that has gricked me all along.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.680]   I don't subscribe to HBO.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   They have some great shows, but I don't want to pay out the full freight for the cable and the HBO.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   Finally --
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   It's a great to watch.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   Yeah, the thing is it's a perfect way to watch it for people like you and me and I know like our friend Alex.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   Because you sit down and I don't know if you guys have digested these shows the way that I have,
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   but when we got into the Sopranos or when we got into Deadwood in particular,
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   with Deadwood, we started late and we bought the first two seasons.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   Yeah, right.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680]   First, and just watch it straight through.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   Every night we were watching like two or three years.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   That's the way to do it.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   This is the way to really immerse yourself in the show.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:08.680]   So, 26 bucks for the wire, season one, which is by the way a great -- I mean, one of the great cop dramas ever made.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   Oh.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   Oh.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.680]   Pretty heavy duty.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   You got to be into this kind of gritty reality show.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.680]   So, now they have Rome, they have Deadwood.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:24.680]   And many of these are so much more enjoyable when you watch them like one a night or one every couple nights,
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   rather than waiting for --
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   Much better way to watch it.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.680]   It's a much better way to watch it.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   Unfortunately, what happens with my -- with Carlita and I is that we have a tendency to watch for in a row.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.680]   Oh, all you do is candy.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   Yeah, we don't do it.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   [ Laughter ]
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.680]   We don't like --
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   It would lost.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   You get to the end, you're like, "Oh, let's go --
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   This is a revolution.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   When these things started coming out on DVD, it changed everybody's viewing habits.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   Just the same way Tivo changed everybody's to be viewing habits.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:52.680]   Suddenly DVD TV, I think the networks, if they were smart, would just kill this whole thing because nobody's going to watch TV in a couple of years.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.680]   And it's like, I don't mind spending the money.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.680]   I mean, I've gone out and bought, you know, whole seasons of DVDs, but what am I going to do?
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   I'm going to bring them home and I'm going to rip them and then I'm never going to look at them again.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.680]   Right.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.680]   So, this is perfect.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.680]   Oh, no.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.680]   Half the time when I buy these, I watch it and then I just delete it because I don't really want to see it again.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.680]   Me, too.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.680]   It was worth it too much.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   Too much storage.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.680]   I'm done.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.680]   I think that's going to be -- it's funny.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.680]   I was watching some TV show the other day and noticing, like, you know, it was a very, like, high status young professional guy.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.680]   And you could tell he was really high status professional guy because he had these walls of CDs.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.680]   And I just think that -- I mean, I think books are going to make a comeback.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.680]   I think books are going to make a sense to people.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.680]   I think, like, showing all of your Pink Floyd CDs on a shelf, I think is not going to be nearly as cool as it was, you know, 15 years ago.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.680]   All that space that we give away.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.680]   Well, look at my bookshelves are empty.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   It's got rid of it.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   And I'm slowly ripping everything -- Oh, I haven't done everything yet.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   I've been slowly ripping -- I got this Drobo and I've been just constantly filling it up.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:51.680]   But one of the things I'm doing is just slowly ripping absolutely everything and pulling all of that stuff off the shelves, putting it in boxes.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   Do you use Delicious Library?
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.680]   Because I mean, you want to kind of have this great organization for it, right?
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   You know, all my music -- I mean, everything's just going into iTunes, you know, right now.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   And so -- This is what Delicious Library was made for.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   For iTunes?
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.680]   No, for content to rip it, and then you scan the barcode.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   It goes out to Amazon.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.680]   It gets all the album art, it gets the descriptions -- You can also use that -- I mean, Gina wrote a --
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   -- post about the Sun Life Hacker, and this is a Subratt hole, but we should come back around at this.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.680]   That amazing -- The Subratt holes are acceptable, I'm sorry.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   -- Media Center?
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   That Media Center? There's an OS X version?
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.680]   Oh, I saw that.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   The Xbox Media Center.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   I'm going to put that on my little mini.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   But it does the same thing.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   It does the same thing.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.680]   It can grock the name.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   It'll go out and pull down the covers for you.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   Your Life Hacker has a fantastic --
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   I just -- I just set aside my mini.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   -- I set aside my mini.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   I'm going to -- I'm going to -- I'm getting an HDTV.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   We're going to put the Xbox Media Center interface on it.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   -- No, why -- no, why would you need the Xbox Media Center?
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   -- Better than front row.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   -- Better than front row?
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   Well, will front row look up those kinds of things?
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   -- Well, well, for a billion.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   -- A few guys.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   Just throw A/V eyes in there.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   -- I guess -- I guess for me --
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   -- So --
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.680]   -- I don't really -- I mean, I --
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   -- I don't -- look at the Xbox thing.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   For me, I just don't want another piece of --
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.680]   -- I don't think fans of the movie have been --
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.680]   -- I don't think fans of the mini.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   -- Well, it's been hard work.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   -- I like it.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   -- What?
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.680]   -- It's just software.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   Hold on, we're waiting.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   We're just -- we're a little confused.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   -- My phone's going off.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.680]   -- The phone's going off and we're wandering around.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.680]   -- There we go.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.680]   Go ahead.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   -- So the -- so --
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   -- You were saying it's just software for the mini?
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   -- Yeah.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.680]   -- Oh, okay.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   So it's not --
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.680]   -- Oh, it's a -- oh, it's a software-ready Xbox.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   It's imported to OS X.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.680]   -- Well, it's an open source project.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.680]   -- You throw all of --
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   -- Oh, I got it.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   -- Now, will you go in and you say,
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   here's where all my movies live.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   Here's where all my photos live.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   It could be an external drive.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   It could be whatever.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.680]   Here's where all my photos are.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   And it has the smarts to go grab all that and turn it into
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   this browsable library that I mean -- I'm just saying like,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   you know, if you aren't into visual hub and getting all that
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.680]   stuff into another format, a lot of the -- I understand that a
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   lot of the media out there on the Internet is an AVI format
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.680]   apparently.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   Did I say that right?
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680]   AVI.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.680]   Apparently.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.680]   -- It's pretty bad out there.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.680]   -- Well, no, I can all use --
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   -- I saw that go by.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   I saw that go by on the Macbreak ideas, I think.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.680]   Macbreak weekly ideas.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680]   And I thought it was a hardware.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   I didn't realize it was a software.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   -- No, this is --
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   -- No, you put it -- no, it's not a software.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   -- I can't wait to play with it.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.680]   -- Now, the only thing I have to admit is I am a little addicted
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   to having my little controller, too.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.680]   -- It uses the --
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.680]   -- It works.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680]   -- I use the little Apple controller.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   -- Yeah.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.680]   -- Okay, well, very cool.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   -- You're going to want this.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   I'm going to do -- we'll do a show about it on Twit Live because
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   I'm putting Justin -- I'm calling to work on this because she's going to -- we're going to totally dress this thing up.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   I can't wait.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   I'm so excited.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680]   -- Yeah.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   -- It's better than an Apple TV.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   -- I can sort of top all this because I was in a position.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   I have to look for -- I've been living in the same place for about 10 years.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.680]   I'm going to be moving this summer, still looking for new places.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.680]   And now I'm in the process of getting all the media, like all the magazines I've written for,
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   all the books that I love, all my comics, all my CDs, all my DVDs, packing up and moving them.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   And I'm actually thinking, when I move into the new place, just try to see how long I can live without any actual media inside the house, where everything is digital, where --
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.680]   Of course, I'll have a copy of People magazine.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.680]   I'll read that for a day.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.680]   I don't throw it away.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   But I will never have -- I won't have any paper books.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   I won't have any CDs.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   I won't have any DVDs.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   I'll try to -- I have in the middle so I can buy books online and do it that way.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   I want to see how long I can go without acquiring -- or without acquiring any physical media inside the house.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   But that doesn't include bits, right?
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   You can have bit torrent running.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680]   Exactly.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   Everything digital.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   Meaning if it can't be on a hard drive, then I shouldn't try to keep it inside the house.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.680]   Now, the exception will be for P.G. Woodhouse.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   P.G. Woodhouse has to have his own little bookcase.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.680]   Jeeves and the use paper.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   Other than that.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.680]   Other than that.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   So this is probably why you see companies like HBO finally caving and going to iTunes and saying, "Okay, now iTunes caved in this one because this is the first time they've done variable pricing.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   $2.99 for some of these HBO shows."
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   Is that okay?
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   Would you pay that much?
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.680]   I find that so not confusing.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.680]   I've got to say.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   There's a long time where I was like Steve, Steve, everything's a dollar.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   But now I've got to tell you, it doesn't bother me at all.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   Yeah, it doesn't -- I don't understand, frankly, Steve's --
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:02.680]   Even if it's a part of me that as a former failed interface designer, there's a part of me that always thinks it's just because they don't want to cruft up the interface.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   I think it's not a pricing issue.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   I don't think that's that confusing.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.680]   Certainly the vendors would be happy to see you.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   Well, that's why NBC left.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   At least the one that public complaint was that there wasn't variable pricing.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   You just don't want to turn it into this crazy looking --
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.680]   It doesn't look it.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.680]   You go to the -- It's just a price.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   It's not going to the store.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   There's different prices.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.680]   We're used to this.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.680]   Different prices for things.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.680]   I don't know if anyone's heard of that.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   Steve, jobs have you heard about that?
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.680]   Although I think that with this stuff, I'm quite a bit more --
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.680]   Your boyfriend's going to be mad at you.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   Steve, I don't think it's the dollar store.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   The dollar store is the only place where you can depend on that and you don't want to spend a huge amount of money.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.680]   I think it's -- I have to be what I would prefer on variable pricing.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   It's like $2.99 to buy it.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.680]   But with these shows, I really would just -- I just sold the rent in for $0.99.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   Just let me rent the thing.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   To me, it's more of a value.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   I just can't think at $1.99, I will buy an episode of "How I'm Sorry."
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   I will buy an episode of "The Sopranos or the Wire" at $2.99.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:00.680]   I'm like, "I'm so close to being able to rent an entire DVD, like an entire two hours with the movies.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   I'm so close to being able to go to my local store and buy a used DVD.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.680]   I've got Netflix.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   I'm so willing to wait a week to get something that I would otherwise pay $2.99 for."
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:19.680]   I don't know where this point is for everybody, but $1.99 is about the most amount of money I'm willing to pay for a piece of media that I don't actually get a physical backup copy of.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.680]   Then you get "Flight of the Concords."
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   Because they're only $1.99.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   Well, and I have to admit that even now that my -- once again, my wife was very much like, "Oh, she just likes to Netflix everything.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   She doesn't want to download anything on iTunes."
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   She'd let me pay for downloading on iTunes, but she doesn't want to do it.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   She got me hooked on the whole Netflix thing where I'm just going to wait until it gets done, then we're just going to order it.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   I agree with Andy. He's right on that precipice, where if it was $0.99, I would never think about networking.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.680]   At $2.99, I won't think about buying it.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.680]   $1.99 is this thing where if it's good enough, I might pick it up.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   99 cents, I just buy it all.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   They say that's why Steve is holding frast on the $0.99 for records.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.680]   Records can't go up. Music can't go up.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   Video is more of a premium product.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   Records are overpriced. I think they're already too much.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   I think that the thing is we would have no piracy at 25 cents a song.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   I'll definitely not a song.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   A Nicholas song is enough -- and this sounds silly, but there's a Canadian study out of University of Ontario.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   I think that a Nicholas song is the right price that everybody would make money because they'd buy more.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.680]   They did a lot of research on this, and you'd buy a lot of music at a Nicholas song.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.680]   I'd buy it all.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   I'd buy everything.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   I'd buy my entire old library again to just have it all in one thing.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   That's the point is that people would do that. There's no barrier to entry at a Nicholas song.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.680]   There is a right price.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   I think a buck 99 for Sex and the City.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:42.680]   They've got every -- unlike some of these, Sex and the City, it's every season.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   It's every season is on here.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.680]   I don't know why they haven't done that with everything.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   They just had a duress in development too. That's one of my favorite shows.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680]   That's a great show.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.680]   I watched that on DVD as opposed to -- Yeah, I had to buy it because it was on iTunes.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.240]   It drives me crazy that the HBO stuff is -- and it looks like do they have all the
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.760]   Soprano seasons?
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.760]   Just one in six.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.520]   Yeah, I'm usually the guy who goes like, "Oh, I don't understand these crazy business."
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.680]   I totally understand why HBO would be reluctant.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   Well, they're nervous.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.680]   Well, sure.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.680]   I mean, they've got a lot of cable companies that are giving them a significant amount of money
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.680]   to keep that scarcity in place.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   Even though I may not agree with it, I totally agree.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   I think it's crazy not to have it available, but I certainly do understand why they wouldn't
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   want to.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.680]   But I wonder if in some ways that that shows a different shift in strategy.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.680]   It is, I think.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.680]   It's huge.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.680]   I mean, these are the last guys that we're going to consider.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.080]   I don't have channel conflict when you're all of your programming is being supported by
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.080]   these different, you know, cable companies.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.840]   Well, I think that also, if you look at -- I mean, you could see a slow push as cable
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.600]   continues to kind of go down.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.840]   I think you could definitely see a slow push where HBO and Showtime and so on and so forth
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.680]   are making these, and they're only for sale.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.680]   You know, and they just happen to -- that's how their content gets out.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.320]   So it scares the cable companies.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.920]   It does, but I think that that's going to take a long time because one of the things
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:01.200]   about it is, is they're guaranteed $15, $12 or $15 per sub right now.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.560]   Otherwise, they have to fight piracy.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.680]   They have to fight all these other things for the -- you know, they would have to lower
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   the price.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.000]   If they really move to a -- we're going to sell everything that we make.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.800]   They would be really selling it or renting it at 50 cents or 99 cents each, and then
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.800]   people would just buy everything that they need.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   Yeah, and they have an artificially propped-up business model if they're getting 50 bucks,
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.640]   15 bucks a sub, because they can make any kind of crap.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.520]   So this really forces them to sell stuff or make stuff that sells.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.720]   Well, I think HBO does have to keep that up because because it's a premium channel,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.640]   they do have to make a case for why you're going to upgrade from the basic cable to the
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   advanced cable.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.640]   Right, right, right.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.640]   And I haven't done it.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   You haven't done calling?
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   I don't know.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   I mean, not to calling Justine.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   I'm confused.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   You don't even have a TV.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   You don't have a TV, Alex.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.640]   No, I don't.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.520]   I mean, I have a Mac Mini and an HD monitor.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.760]   Andy has a TV.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   And he watches it.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.320]   Yeah, he watches What's That Show?
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320]   Matt Lock?
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   Matt Lock.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.800]   He's watching it right now.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.640]   The birds still have to admit, I've watched a lot of Hulu.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.720]   I probably watch more Hulu now than iTunes.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.440]   You know, I mean, I see this surprises me.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.520]   I thought Hulu would not happen only because you have to sit in front of a computer screen
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.520]   and watch it.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520]   That's what I do a lot.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.520]   Me too.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.640]   So like, if I want to break it in, but it's got like, you know, the second season of Highland
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.800]   there just came out and I'm very excited about the whole thing.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.080]   So I, you know, but or, but they, you can watch A team, Simon and Simon.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.080]   Very, very high, high quality.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.480]   Like, who is the reason I started watching rest of development?
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.080]   And then I'm like, crap, the only the first season.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   So I had to go out and purchase.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.520]   So that's a good business for them.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.620]   Yeah, but it made me really mad.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.280]   But the first season on Hulu sell the rest of them.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.440]   Yeah, the only problem with Hulu is you get these random, you know, other than the
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.760]   ones they get, you know, like there's one like the medium is medium is great because
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.320]   medium comes out the day after, you know, you know, that it's out there.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.640]   But a lot of these you get there's like six from season one and four from season two.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.520]   And you know, that kind of stuff makes me a little crazy.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.400]   Apple is a revving service pack one for Mike Apple.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.320]   I'm so say Microsoft for Microsoft Office for the Macintosh.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:03.720]   SP one is coming out and they've announced they're going to return in the next version.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.040]   They're going to bring back visual basic for applications.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.520]   Now, are you still using?
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.520]   Are you using?
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.520]   I use office using pages.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.520]   Yep.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.520]   I'm all on pages.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.400]   So here's the thing is that the numbers.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.640]   I mean, the word versus pages is kind of for me.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.560]   That's still back and forth.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.560]   But numbers.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.640]   If you're not doing big complex stuff like I do, I use numbers a lot to or I used to
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.480]   use Excel a lot to just organize thoughts.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:30.560]   You know, I just need a grid to kind of figure stuff out and numbers is so much better for
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.720]   that that I just I am just I am so sold.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   I would never go back to Excel.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:40.160]   Like I get Excel files and I and I and they open up in Excel and I'm like, why was I every
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   year?
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.440]   So, but you know, the pages one is a little less it's a little heavier than word, but
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.440]   I was surprised.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.520]   I got a I got a document that had all of those revisions that word has.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.520]   And I was surprised.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.320]   It opened it up and it actually looked way nicer in pages than it did.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.320]   I have to say I now open when I get word documents from a PC friends, I have word and
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.160]   I double click it and I always go, Oh, shoot, when it opens words, like I don't want word
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   open.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.160]   I want pages.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.920]   I was really surprised at how nice it looked and how easy it was to deal with with all the
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.320]   revisions and everything else way better than word.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.080]   Yeah, I don't even have word on here anymore.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   Andy, you got a you you have to because of your work.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.000]   But you can export docs.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.200]   I think Andy fell over, but the bird's still there.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.000]   So we know his mic is on.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.720]   We just lasted too long and he had to break early.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.840]   I I I bought a copy of word actually, I didn't buy a copy word.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.360]   I got a copy of street legal copy of word for speaking at.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   Mackerel.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.360]   Yep.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.200]   That's the copy that I have.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.200]   So great.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.200]   So now I got I'm legal.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:42.000]   I'm I'm honest and good with Microsoft and this is awesome.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.200]   And so I go and somebody sends me something and I as you say, I think it was from my attorney.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:51.320]   It was a red line thing I had to look at and I opened it up and Microsoft Office launched
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.840]   four applications.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   It opened work.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.840]   I know it's so annoying, isn't it?
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.120]   It put an updater in also open up some kind of a meta updater.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.720]   It opened up and it opened up the like, Hey, look, here's your entourage stuff from like
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.440]   1945 that you forgot.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.760]   And it was it was vexing to me.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:12.800]   And I mean, I guess for the sake of sounding even handed, I'll say I understand why they
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.200]   do that, but I don't.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.320]   I think an application that I think what has happened in the last three to five years of
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.520]   OS 10 development has really spoiled us for how simple an application can be in terms
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:26.280]   of operation and any of these Adobe products and these Microsoft products that do these
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:30.640]   insane update things that take over everything and grab your screen.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.200]   It's just maddening to me for and then I open it up and it looks like a frickin cockpit
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   from a 747.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.960]   I just want to print this thing out.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   Can I give?
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.400]   I was going to do a pic later on, but I'm going to give it away now.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.680]   If you don't mind, I'm showing it right now.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.280]   So just need an Alex can see it Adobe has this has actually been out for a while, but
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.920]   it's now public beta buzz.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.760]   This is Adobe buzzword.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.960]   This is a flash based words brought word process.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.200]   Adobe's doing it or something else.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.720]   It's buzzword.acrobat.com.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   And and it is very sweet.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.880]   You can share these documents.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.120]   I mean, this is Google Docs only much slicker.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.000]   Yeah, I think they bought that for they acquired that from somebody.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Yes, they did.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.240]   It was one of those sometimes you see one of these new web apps and you can see every third
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.040]   word in the about boxes by us.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.200]   This is a new word process for bias, please.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   That is the best.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   It takes the paradigm.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   So in pleased at bestness.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   We don't want to work anymore.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.000]   Well, it's which elevates word processing to IPO IPO IPO.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.160]   Yeah, but they've done a very nice job with this.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.720]   I have to say I'm very impressed and.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   Does this run an air?
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   Do they have an air version?
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.880]   Well, that's what's interesting about it.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.640]   So right now it's web only.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.800]   It is Safari 2, but not three although.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.000]   I mean, sorry, three, but not three one, but except it works fine.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   You just go past that Firefox 2, but not Firefox 3 again.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   It works fine.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   I'm using it right now in flock.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   It works fine.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.880]   It's flash based, but they are going to do an air version, which means it'll be a standalone
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.560]   desktop app as well as.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.520]   Well, I think the air is really this.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.520]   That's exciting.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.520]   That's a Trojan horse.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.520]   Yes.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520]   It's a Trojan horse by Adobe.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.520]   When people aren't excited about it, I think they're missing the point because.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.240]   Well, Microsoft has a silver light, which is the new silver light too is a competitive
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   product.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.000]   Silver light one was a flash player.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.320]   Silver light two is it.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.960]   It's competitive, but it's not the same.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.520]   You watch because NBC is going to use it on the Olympics this year and it's going to get
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.280]   a lot of play.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   That's going to make it competitive.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.280]   I agree with you.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.280]   I'm much more excited about it.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   I haven't seen the silver light.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:16.200]   But the thing is, I haven't seen a development platform like what you're seeing with air.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.400]   I haven't seen the action script people out there.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.400]   Yes.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.560]   Well, that's the whole thing is you have this huge group of developers that are already
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.520]   using action script, already using flash, already using a lot of the tools that are
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.520]   required.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.680]   For them to develop for air and be able to now develop using the same skills that they
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.360]   had before and be able to develop for the desktop, a cross platform, I think that's
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   exciting.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:43.880]   I have downloaded a bunch of stuff from Silver light and I get why Microsoft's doing it.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.760]   Some of the video has been okay, but I haven't seen anything at that nearly the level of
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.600]   what I'm seeing with some of the little air stuff that's already coming out.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.840]   I'm a little bit worried about these things though.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.800]   I don't want to see.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.520]   I like the idea of platform independence.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.800]   I like the idea of really rich web apps.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.640]   What I don't like is the idea of writing an application that is not a Mac app and it's
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.960]   not a those app.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.200]   It's just floats freeform taking advantage of none of the special features available
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   in any OS.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.200]   That's mediocrity.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   That's the wall modernization.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   It is.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.000]   But the thing is, is because you're using flash, it's all really cool.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.920]   I mean, it's like, like the thing is, and I have to admit that we're looking at the
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.680]   real risk is because it's flash.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.840]   It sucks, but it sucks with a specular reflection on it.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   It's a good thing.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.840]   Right.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   Right.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:37.680]   Well, but I think that the issue is that is, for instance, we are looking at moving a lot
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.400]   of the Pixelcore.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   We're trying to figure out ways to get air to run almost all the services that the Pixel
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.240]  core provides its members because it's an app that I know that everyone's going to be
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.640]   able to use.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:53.640]   I have to say that I am openly frustrated with QuickTime at this point that I think Apple
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.320]   is falling painfully behind when it comes to--
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   It's not even in the ballpark.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.240]   And here's the worst part is that the interactivity in QuickTime was state of the art five or
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   six years ago.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   They even started taking it out.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.920]   And the problem is now my flash layers don't even work in QuickTime, which is interactivity
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.440]   stuff that we had been testing for a long time that now is broken.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.080]   And so the thing is, is that I think Apple is missing the boat here.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.120]   And I think Adobe is the one to watch when it comes to I'm adding interactivity to the
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.600]   web, I'm adding interactivity to-- and I don't know whether I'm going to do word processing
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.800]   in a flash app or in an air app.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:31.080]   But I do see being able to create really sticky--
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.560]   Let me show you this.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   This is Silverlight.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.120]   This is a demo that Microsoft did for the Hard Rock Cafe.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   It's a memorabilia thing.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.840]   This is where Twit Live, if I had my switcher and I could switch to it.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.840]   You'd be able to screen it.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.000]   I'd be able to show everybody.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.760]   But what these are, these are memorabilia.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.200]   Now what's happening is it's, as it's zooming in, it's bringing up the resolution of this.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.760]   Well, not using a lot of the technology.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.240]   Microsoft is sitting on incredible technology within--
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.240]   This is really hardcore technology.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.240]   But look how close--
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.240]   That looks really good.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.880]   It's very close and so that's the--
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.080]   And I can zoom in very closely this memorabilia.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.960]   This stuff has been taken in very high resolution.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.160]   I can't remember how to get back.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.120]   Oh, there it goes, shift.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.240]   So this, I mean, this allows you to browse through here.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   I mean, look at it.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.520]   You say, oh, here's a jacket.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.960]   I don't know, a ZZ Top word or something.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.400]   Well, Jerry Lee Lewis is Paisley jacket.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.320]   But watch how I zoom in on this.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.640]   And this is in real time.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.240]   It's not loading it ahead of time.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.240]   You could see the--
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   You could see the fibers.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   You could see the fibers.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.560]   Well, that's all the photos and technology
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.240]   that is probably the state of the art.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   That's silver light.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   And that's silver light.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.520]   But that's one thing that you can do with silver light.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.240]   What I think Adobe's doing with Air
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.240]   is doing an entire development platform.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.240]   And I do think--
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.680]   Well, silver light's going to have that too.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.240]   It's C#. It's a dot net.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.120]   What it really does is it takes a Windows presentation layer.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:44.680]   And puts it--
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.760]   Now, look, I'm not arguing for Microsoft here.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.320]   I'm just playing devil's advocate.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.400]   But it puts the Windows presentation layer on the internet.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.320]   So what you're really saying is Adobe's coming here
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.040]   and saying, OK, we're going to put the flash presentation layer
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:01.720]   out there and make it accessible to programmers.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.120]   Which has more potential potency is, of course,
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   the Windows-- I think the Windows presentation layer.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.640]   And this is very powerful stuff.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.960]   So now, in that-- the flash word processor,
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.720]   can you export that out and anything?
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.160]   Buzzword.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.240]   It is so cool.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:14.760]   So cool.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.680]   And it's free right now.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.240]   I don't know what Adobe plans to do with it.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:18.880]   Buzzword doc.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.320]   I actually was going to be my pick.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.280]   But it's really a slick word processor.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.280]   I was using one that was still in its looking for money stage.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.640]   And I like the features of it.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.200]   I've really preferred having the features in a desktop app.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:32.720]   That's all.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.400]   Well, and that's why I think you're right.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.360]   And I think a flex version of this, which
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.400]   gives you the online capability when you want to be online.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.560]   I mean, I guess Google gears does that with rightly,
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   with the Google Docs.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:42.640]   But--
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.280]   Yeah, I haven't-- I started playing with that.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.520]   And then I just was like, I'd rather just use pages.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.280]   Somebody twitted me after I started talking about Buzzword
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.040]   on Twitter saying, you know, I sent you an invitation
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.400]   of that last year.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:56.900]   We asked you--
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.560]   I'm going to take you a little time.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   We get a lot of invitation.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.600]   Pay attention to everything.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.120]   So they are going to put V--
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.440]   I said this and nobody jumped at it.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.000]   But I'll say it again.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   They're going to put VBA back into Microsoft Office.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.240]   That was a hotly contested thing when they took it out
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.720]   of the current Microsoft Office 2008.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.640]   A lot of VBA developers were upset.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.240]   Microsoft said an interesting thing.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.560]   They said, well, you got AppleScript.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.800]   You got Automator.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.160]   Great.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.480]   We've got a great script dictionary.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.560]   What do you need?
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.120]   VBA.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.160]   But I guess there are a lot of people still--
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.400]   There's people who already were using it.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.240]   And that's the whole thing.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.200]   So it's coming back, which I guess is an admission.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.880]   Well, they say it was very hard to implement.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.000]   So we had to take a couple of versions.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.960]   But I think it's an admission that maybe it was a mistake
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.200]   to take it out in the first place.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.080]   That'll be in the next version.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.760]   Microsoft denied any conspiracy theories
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.640]   such as Microsoft is slowly trying to kill the Mac
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:53.000]   or drive users to Windows versions where VBA persists.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.800]   He said, we just-- we couldn't do it.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.480]   So people need programming functionality
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.640]   in their word processor.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.640]   Is that what they need?
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.760]   Yeah, you know who needs it?
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.560]   Business.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.000]   No, I mean, consultants need that functionality.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.640]   And IT guys need that functionality.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.560]   That's how they make their money.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.880]   They're writing that kind of stuff.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.600]   And if you happen-- you know, it's funny.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.080]   The interesting use of AppleScript.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.600]   AppleScript, some of us use it, some of us don't.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.640]   But the people who use it and are totally relying on it
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.240]   are prepress people.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:19.720]   Right.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.440]   They use Apple.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.080]   I remember talking to Sal Seguani, he said,
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:22.840]   you don't understand.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.480]   Yeah, no, it's--
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.680]   AppleScript is enabling technology.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.400]   It sells more Macs than anything
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.800]   because all these prepress people
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.440]   have huge workflows done in script.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.240]   I used to-- that was what I used to do for--
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.200]   I used to work on a catalog or not a catalog
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.640]   of yellow pages kind of thing.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.960]   Not a yellow pages, but like a directory.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.680]   And between AppleScript and Quark and extensions
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.400]   and all this other stuff, everything was automated.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.520]   So they changed something in the database.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.920]   It would take all that stuff out of FileMaker,
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.800]   stick it all into the catalog, change it,
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.200]   make sure that it rolled over correctly,
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.280]   make sure that it was all connected, and all of that.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.280]   And there is no way you could have done that
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.240]   without AppleScript gluing it all together.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.280]   I guess I just want to advocate for a--
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.000]   probably just play devil's advocate.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.680]   Yes, that sounds very important.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.800]   But I think there's another side to this
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.520]   that must not be missed, which is, as you see,
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.880]   certain apps get heavier and heavier and heavier
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.680]   and struggling to maintain market share.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.200]   You see this crop of applications
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   going, you know what?
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.400]   I don't need to be Photoshop.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.080]   I don't need to be Microsoft Word.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.400]   And I just-- I mean, obviously, the people who buy Microsoft Word
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.760]   as part of Office are going to continue to buy Microsoft Word,
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.120]   they're probably not going to lose that.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.280]   But I just think it's interesting.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.760]   There's a different kind of-- there's
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.600]   this kind of under-the-surface kind of sub-brosal battle
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.280]   over the heaviness of applications.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.400]   And I guess I just-- I'm personally-- I'm really impressed
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.880]   by these applications that keep taking features away
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.880]   until it's just in the sweet spot, rather than--
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.720]   I mean, I just-- I don't know.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.960]   Maybe I just think that Microsoft Word that I had in 1991--
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.560]   I hate to sound like that guy.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.160]   But whatever it was, Word 5, I want to say.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.560]   - 5-1. - 5-1 was the best.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   No, Word Perfect 5-1 is what you're thinking.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.520]   No, no, no, I'm thinking of Word.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.160]   Word, Word 5.1 was the best Word--
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.400]   It was the one right-- - Best Word--
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.120]   Best Microsoft Word ever made.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.120]   - Clerus Word. - 1991.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.120]   Clerus Word-- - Clerus Word.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.200]   Great program.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.680]   - Clerus Word. - Okay, I'll show you what.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.240]   - That was one of-- - You guys want to whip it out.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.640]   - Yeah. - I'll go right now.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.640]   - 5. - 5.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.840]   - I have to say, there was a Word Perfect version, maybe it was Word Perfect 3-1.
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.480]   - But we're all saying Word 3 was the same thing, which is that--
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.280]   Think about it this way.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.280]   Think about when you drive a sports car, right?
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.600]   And maybe it's not the most comfortable seats in the world,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.400]   but you feel very in touch with the road.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.160]   And I think there's certain-- that's why VI continues to have traction,
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.440]   because VI, or to a certain extent, EMACs, I guess,
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.640]   not going to get into that war.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.920]   But you know this application so well, and you fly through it.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.960]   I think it excels at that-- - There's a lot to be said for.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.800]   And I mean, I write-- - Because you like right-room, Merlin.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.640]   I know you're a big fan of hog-based softwares, right, right?
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.200]   But I mean, you know what's funny is like for me, and again--
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.520]   - And that's like a green-screen word process.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.360]   - Well, I want to bracket this by saying this is just me,
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.920]   and I'm just a guy who writes for the web.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.200]   I invariably end up, ex-mate, writing in Markdown.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.880]   And it's like there's nothing I need to say that can't be done
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.080]   with Markdown and maybe with the addition of Footnotes.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:01.400]   That's just me. - I use-- I write all of my articles,
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.720]   all my copy, everything else, in TextEdit.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.480]   - TextEdit and Stikies. - TextEdit, you know,
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.200]   Jeffine, a friend who recently left Google.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.280]   - Stikies? - He would send back.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.600]   He would send back any document.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.320]   - Look at her stickies. - Oh my God.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.400]   - Show me the camera. - That is--
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.200]   - This is actually-- I just cleaned it up recently.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:25.400]   - I once took meeting notes and stickies and somehow lost.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.080]   I never will do it again. - That's what happened.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.080]   - You trust that? - Well, I mean, the good stuff
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.400]   that I actually really need, I'll export it and save it.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.920]   But I mean, like, I'll just create these lists.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.280]   - And you've got them all minimized, and--
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.040]   - Oh my God. - Yeah, usually I can't find anything.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.520]   - Wow. - I wish people could see that screen.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.200]   That is incredible. - It's a disaster area.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.680]   - It's yellow. - Her holes, her whole power book
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.000]   is yellow. - I mean, the more important stuff,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.080]   you know, I have a pink or a blue.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.880]   - What did Jeffine say, Merlin?
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.640]   - That's rattle. - I like rattle holes.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.840]   You know, we all love rattle holes.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.240]   - We do, we love them. - If I didn't have the rattle,
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.640]   if I had-- if I hadn't-- I should explain
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   that I was like 30 seconds before Justine and Alex arrived,
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.440]   rewiring the entire studio.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.520]   And I haven't yet hooked up the audio from the Mac,
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.960]   so I can't play the rat hole music for you.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.800]   But you guys will vouch for it.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.800]   I was like-- - Yeah, it was.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.240]   - I had all the computers in my desk,
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.240]   and it's 100 degree day today. - Right.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.960]   - And I was-- - I am so glad that you have LEDs.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.000]   - It's a lot cooler in here than it would be.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:23.840]   It's still a little getting a little--
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.160]   - We have to shoot them. - We have to shoot tomorrow
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.760]   at our office. - It's gonna be really hot.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.600]   - We're shooting early in the morning.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.480]   - It's gonna be 100 degrees tomorrow.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.160]   You better do it at 5 a.m. - That's the plan.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.920]   - All right, let's get to our picks.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.920]   You sure you don't wanna talk about Jeff Veen?
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.400]   - Oh, no, all I was trying to say was,
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.840]   so this is very interesting,
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.960]   but I just, the stuff that I look at,
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.040]   the color of my crystal when I look at all of this stuff,
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.320]   is the ways in which people have painted themselves
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.280]   in the intractable corners,
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.440]   because they keep trying to solve social
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.920]   and communications problems with more high tech tools.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.040]   And what I keep seeing is people who are instead saying,
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:53.880]   "You know what?
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.280]   Let's throw all of this crap out the window
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.480]   and think about what we really need
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.120]   in order to finish the task that's at hand."
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.560]   Now that might be VBA for some people.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.800]   It sounds like there's a small group of people for whom
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.280]   that kind of stuff is extremely powerful,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.280]   which is awesome.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.320]   I think what's interesting though,
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.680]   is rather than saying like,
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.400]   how do we keep, what's the next new technology
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.880]   that we can run to that's gonna like solve our problems?
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:12.920]   I'm just perpetually interested in things like
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.320]   just use use of stickies,
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.680]   or like my use of text files,
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.520]   or like Jeff Veen saying,
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.360]   "You know what?
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.560]   If you can't tell this to me
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.280]   in something that I can open in text edit,
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.920]   like why don't you go work on it some more
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.480]   and then send it back to me in text edit?"
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.320]   You know?
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.280]   I really like the idea of us giving some pushback
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.520]   to people who are constantly trying to make us
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.680]   use these really overbearing tools.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.280]   And I just think that's an emerging pattern.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.120]   That's cool.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.920]   - I think it's very, very significant that,
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.360]   I mean, I write for a living, that's where I make my money,
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.880]   and I do not have a copy of the latest version of Word
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.280]   on Lilith, on my one really important,
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.240]   on the machine that I do all my real work on,
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.280]   that I switched to Scrivener a few months ago,
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.960]   and I've never written anything that's made me money
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.920]   and anything other than Scrivener since.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.360]   And because it's a slick, streamlined,
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.640]   purpose-built application,
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.560]   just from getting the courage out of my head.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.240]   - It doesn't work like the program thinks.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.000]   It works like the way a writer thinks.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.600]   - I don't care about layout because I've got people
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.160]   at the newspaper and people at the website
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.720]   and people at the book publishers
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.960]   who will lay it out for me.
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.520]   I just need to get the ideas in my head organized
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.200]   in some place where they can start making me money,
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.520]   and that's what Scrivener does for me.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.520]   - Well, I think that there's,
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.440]   and we see this in kind of a macro scale
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.480]   when you start looking at the interconnection
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.080]   between different, you know, like the Final Cut Pro Studio
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.040]   or the Adobe suites, where I don't really want,
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.640]   you know, some people say, "Well, if they're making them
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.080]   "so integrated, why don't you just make them all
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.080]   "one big application?"
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.000]   Well, you don't really want to open one big application.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.360]   You don't want to deal with that interface.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.640]   You want the interfaces.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.080]   The big thing is getting that information
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.720]   between applications effectively.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.720]   Text is easy, but when we want to move images or more data,
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.480]   you know, being able to effectively get stuff
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.720]   in and out of the applications,
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.080]   I think is a very important piece of puzzle.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.600]   - If you're just typing text at it,
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.920]   and in fact you have to lay something out,
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   I'll take it into InDesign,
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.400]   but I'll start typing it in text at it,
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.240]   or my wonderful stickies.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.680]   (laughs)
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.520]   - Sticky.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.720]   - It's funny though, 'cause everybody has their killer app.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.440]   This is something Danny Bryant talked about
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.800]   in the Lifehack stuff.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.240]   And from his research, he discovered that a large number
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:06.000]   of people, their killer apps are either email or Excel.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.080]   So you'll see these patterns where there's an extraordinary
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.280]   number of people that, like, that's the first tool
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.640]   they grab is Excel.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.320]   And it's funny, like I knew people back in the day
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.080]   that wrote in Aldous PageMaker, which always made me laugh.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.240]   - What I did there?
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.960]   - And PageMaker, because they knew they were eventually
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.720]   gonna have to lay it out, and they do, they pull down,
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.800]   you remember the little shutters,
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.240]   you pull down the little roller blinds to layout text?
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.400]   - Oh yeah!
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.760]   - And with it just a full-plus side.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.160]   Yeah, they sit there in Palatino, just typing away
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.480]   in Aldous PageMaker.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.320]   - You know, 'cause that's the tool they had,
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.200]   and that's the tool they knew.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.280]   - I saw an interactive presentation, which just looked
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.240]   a little different than everything else I'd ever seen,
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.800]   and I asked the guy what he'd built it in,
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.600]   and he built an interactive presentation in Excel.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.520]   - Oh, total?
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.360]   - Yeah.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.200]   - And it would take you to a different sheet,
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.400]   so each sheet was its own little thing,
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.160]   but it had little animations,
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.400]   and he had little things moving around,
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.520]   and I was like, that guy has, you know,
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.720]   there's this thing called--
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.920]   - One of the best designers in the world
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.600]   is this guy named Cuyvin, who has a site called subtraction.com,
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.400]   and he's currently, I think he's the,
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.120]   he's the, I don't know his exact title,
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.760]   but he's the muckety muck of design for the New York Times.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.960]   And if you go and Google on Keynote for print,
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.280]   he shows you how he uses Keynote to do his print documents,
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.200]   like his annual report type stuff.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.040]   He does it all in Keynote,
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.720]   'cause he thinks that's the amount of tools that he needs
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.840]   in order to make a dependable grid base layout,
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.480]   and it looks awesome.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.360]   - Keynote's fantastic, and I was amazed
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.760]   by the stuff he could do with Keynote, so.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.400]   - Oh God, I'm giving a talk on Friday,
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.240]   and like, they gave me that whole,
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.000]   nice, super nice people, but they were like,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.400]   yeah, send us your slides so we can have--
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.200]   - Oh, are you Apple people?
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.440]   - It wasn't an Apple, it was another company
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.680]   I'm gonna speak at, but, and they were like,
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:37.840]   I'll send it to your stuff, and we'll have it already
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:38.840]   in PowerPoint.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.520]   Like, I have these really cool transitions,
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.360]   but--
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.200]   - Man.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.020]   - Man.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:46.840]   - No, no.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.680]   - Send us your talk so we can shave it.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.200]   (laughing)
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.040]   - Your dog will be--
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.920]   - Your dog will be returned largely on harm.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.120]   Have you guys seen this Apple Mac video,
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.040]   the music video that was all done?
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.640]   The stickies made me think of this.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.480]   - I see them.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.600]   - It's so cool.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.440]   Have you seen this?
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.440]   We play it for you.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.480]   I'm trying to find the name of the band.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.800]   - It's all done with like OS 10.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.120]   - It's all done with OS 10 desktop.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.640]   It's The Bird and The Bee,
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.480]   and a song called Again and Again.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.360]   You can see this on YouTube.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.000]   - Is that a new website, YouTube?
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.240]   - Yeah, it's, they have videos.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.080]   - Really?
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:27.840]   - What's cool is they typing this in text edit,
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.120]   and they've got a little, what is that Mac that's,
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.320]   it's like the Talking Moose,
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.280]   it's looking at you, the Dancing Mac thing.
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.640]   - Oh geez.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.480]   - Whoa.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.160]   But what's interesting, it gets better and better
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.680]   as they go along,
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.320]   and they use photo booth for her video.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.960]   They use a lot of typeface changes.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.240]   It's all done on OS 10.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.800]   - Those of us who are driving with a Wi-Fi connection,
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.080]   what should we be typing into YouTube
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.480]   to make this visible to us?
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.640]   - I think if you do type in Again and Again
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.720]   and The Bird and The Bee,
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.000]   because that's the name of the band,
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.360]   and Again and Again is a song,
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:03.400]   it's not a great video, but if you are Mac user,
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.840]   it's kind of fun to identify all the different apps.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:06.680]   - Right.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.560]   - That's Photoshop, right?
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.400]   - Yup.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.280]   - That's crafty.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.120]   - It's crafty.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.960]   - Yeah, very Etsy.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:11.800]   - It's a very good version of it.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.960]   - Very Etsy.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.200]   Is that gonna be a verb you think Etsy?
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.200]   - Etsy?
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.240]   - Apparently not.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.960]   - I don't wanna annoy people,
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.440]   but there's also a version of this video in Windows XP.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.800]   - Is it really?
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.080]   - Yes there is, I'm looking at it right now.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.560]   - Oh no, I've gotta find that.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.120]   - Oh, you're kidding me.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.200]   - Sacrally.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.040]   - So this is probably not done by the band then.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.320]   This is probably done by--
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   - Look at one, they've also got one in Bash,
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   and it's pretty cool.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.160]   (laughing)
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.320]   - I want the ASCII version.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.400]   - I want the ASCII version.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.040]   - I want the ASCII version.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.640]   Okay, so there's Again and Again.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.200]   - They're editing their profile.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.040]   - Oh, that's funny.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.080]   - Actually, it's a joke.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.240]   It's like the first 30 seconds of the video
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.560]   and then blue screen of death, so.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.840]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.320]   - I've--
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.080]   - You can't do that on Windows.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.280]   - Just kidding.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.240]   - No, you can't do it.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.480]   Any other stories before we get to our Mac break picks
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.400]   and our, of course, our Audible pick of the week.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.720]   Anybody has anything on their mind?
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.080]   We're excited about WWDC.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.280]   Anybody have any oddball predictions?
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.240]   It's something strange Steve might say.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.160]   Will you come back out for WWDC?
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.240]   - If I'm not actually living here.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.400]   - What?
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.760]   - If you're not actually living here.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.480]   - Are you looking moving from Pittsburgh?
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.800]   - I've been trying for the past year and a half,
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.480]   but my lease is finally up, so I'm moving somewhere.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.400]   - Oh, we would love it if you moved to Bay Area
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.960]   'cause we would put you on all the time.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.440]   - No, actually, no, let's do that
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.880]   'cause now we have like half the panel
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.160]   that's gonna be moving like in the next three months.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.160]   So, rather than us going on Craigslist,
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.880]   let's just exploit this and say,
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:41.440]   anybody who can get us a four bedroom apartment
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.840]   with stunning views of either the Mac break house.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.720]   Either the Mac break flop house.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.080]   - Let's have a tree house with a wacky little old.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.040]   - Or the Atlantic Bay or the Pacific Bay.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.640]   We wanted Justine no more than 350 bucks a month.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.960]   - Let's do that, yeah.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.800]   - 350 bucks a month.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.080]   - I've got a lot of cell phones to pay here.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.880]   - It's just on the desk of lunch.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.600]   - It's really fun, but right now, why wouldn't Pittsburgh?
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.600]   So, my cell phone's-- - We might be bringing
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.600]   about 3000 watts worth of electronics.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.360]   So, make sure that the power supply of the house
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.200]   is really good.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.560]   - That's kind of what this place is.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.640]   It's a little cottage and we're gonna have a bedroom
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.560]   in our green room upstairs.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.520]   If you guys ever wanna spend the night,
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.520]   there's a shower, there's a claw foot bathtub.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.760]   But you wanna move to San Francisco, Justine?
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.520]   Are you moving Andy?
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.440]   - I am moving.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.280]   Where are you going?
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.280]   You're not leaving Boston, are you?
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.800]   - I'm staying in the Boston area.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.680]   Unfortunately, the place I've always,
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.040]   I've lived in this property for 10 years.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.040]   I've rented this big, free bedroom.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.120]   - You're never getting out of there.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:33.960]   You know that.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.600]   There's too many layers.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   - Yeah, it was literally, I was like,
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.320]   you know what, I'll just have to be prepared to make sure
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.040]   that I have enough money for a down payment on this place.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.200]   (laughing)
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.960]   - So that if the landlord ever decides to sell the building,
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.680]   I can just buy whatever parts of it.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.320]   But it's starting to look like that's probably not gonna
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.160]   be able to happen.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.120]   So I'm looking for places, obviously,
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.440]   in Eastern Massachusetts.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.080]   But it's like, I spent last weekend,
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.880]   last weekend just going through stuff where,
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:04.240]   I've normally been really, really proud of the grand body
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.920]   of work that I've produced in my career as a writer.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.280]   But last weekend, I filled the U-Haul with old copies
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.760]   of Mac users and Mac weeks, all of them playboys,
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.280]   all of which I've written stuff for.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.000]   And thinking, oh God, why have I written so much crap?
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.280]   - Time to throw it away, I hate to say it.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.240]   And you don't need it anymore.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.680]   - It was actually recently in Boston
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.960]   for the first time for Raffle Con.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.240]   - Oh, you went to Raffle Con.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.480]   Oh my God, I was there too.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:27.600]   Why don't we say another?
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.680]   - I don't know.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.520]   - You couldn't probably see her
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.160]   'cause she was hitting behind Tron Guy.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.760]   - Dude, I love Tron Guy.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.960]   I am now a fan girl of Tron Guy.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.800]   - Tron Guy?
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.640]   - Yes.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.840]   - You don't know who Tron Guy is?
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.120]   Well, you can't go to Raffle Con.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:39.960]   - That's for sure.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.440]   - So tell us what Raffle Con was.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.440]   - It was basically all of the internet memes
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.040]   starting in like 1996, I believe was their tagline
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.840]   or in the making since 1996.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.920]   I mean, you had the can has cheeseburger.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.680]   And it was just the most ridiculous amount
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.360]   of internet people ever.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.960]   And they did a great job getting everybody together.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.800]   - It looked like a great event.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.160]   And Andy, I know I saw your pictures.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.920]   So I knew you were rolling.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.240]   Yeah, it was a great video about that.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.480]   - Did you do rolling on the floor?
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:04.920]   - I did, it was just like pictures.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:05.960]   I'm like, I just laughed.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:07.840]   - I told my kid about Raffle R-O-F-L.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.320]   He said nobody uses that anymore day.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.840]   - I don't think they do.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.920]   But that's why it was just a really good conference.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.320]   There's a lot of great people.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.440]   - Justine, Justine, Colleen says she uses it,
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.200]   but you're over the hill, you're over 20.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.600]   So I'm talking kids, I'm talking people under 20.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.480]   R-O-T-F-L, I said, "Henry, do you know what R-O-T-F-L?"
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.320]   And he said no.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.240]   - Remember back in the day when we used to use those?
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.600]   - He says, "I use--" - Full on the floor laughing.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.800]   - He says, "We use LMAO."
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.640]   - Oh.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.480]   - Oh.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.320]   - Oh.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.160]   - Look at that.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.000]   - Mm.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:34.840]   - Laughing my--
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.680]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.520]   - It took effect.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.320]   - It took us.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.000]   - So anyway, so R-O-F-L-Con was fun.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.840]   - It was a lot of fun.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.280]   - I'm glad you pronounced it, because I didn't know
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.120]   how you said that.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:43.960]   - R-O-F-L.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:44.800]   - So now you think we'll see anything
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.440]   other than the iPhone at WWDC?
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.960]   - I've got independent, like, four different emails
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.680]   from people saying, "My God, you predicted
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.520]   "it right on the money Apple's gonna be introducing
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.400]   "that half tablet you predicted like back in November."
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.720]   - Not at WWDC.
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.560]   - I think they will.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.400]   - Yeah.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.240]   - That would be amazing.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.080]   - I think they will.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:01.920]   - You missed my double take.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:02.760]   - Whoa.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.640]   - I think we're gonna see, I think this is,
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.480]   I think the iPhone is a platform, it's not a phone.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.880]   And I agree with Andy, I think we're gonna see
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:10.720]   a bigger version.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.560]   - So the 3G is not gonna look like that.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:14.600]   - No, I think there'll be a version that looks like this,
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.880]   but I think that I think Apple has to go after
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.560]   that larger form factor.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.840]   - Colin, you have your N800 here?
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.520]   No, we have an N800 which is kind of close to me.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.960]   - You just gave it to me.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.400]   If I had an iPhone, just so you and I were talking
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.320]   about this on the way up.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:31.400]   We had an iPhone that was twice as long and twice as high,
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.040]   and then we could, if we wanted to,
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.280]   have a Bluetooth keyboard that we could, you know,
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.120]   kind of use with it.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:36.960]   - That would be amazing.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.240]   - I'd be done, that'd be my travel.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.200]   Because most of the time, I don't need the keyboard.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.400]   I'd be clicking so I'm trying to find my flight information.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.120]   I'm trying to, I wanna watch big video,
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.480]   I wanna do whatever.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.280]   It would be, you know, that'd be game over.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.600]   960 by 540.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.200]   - That probably hurt the MacBook Air sales.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.040]   - It would, but it'd probably cost the same amount.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.200]   - Like, I don't care, I would definitely rather have that.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.200]   - I'm surprised you don't have an Air.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.040]   I'm surprised to see you here with the 12-inch.
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.000]   - I need Firewire, I just, you know.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.840]   - The Apple UMPC, that's what, yeah, I mean.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.960]   - UMPC, that's the Microsoft version.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.720]   - But I think it doesn't have any keyboard,
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.240]   it doesn't have anything, it's just literally like,
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.760]   if I want to, if I wanna have a Bluetooth keyboard,
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.280]   I can set it, I can prop it up and type on it.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.880]   But outside of that, it would go in my bag
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.800]   and I would never think about, like on a day-to-day basis,
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.880]   I wouldn't go home with a laptop.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.800]   - Well, you guys are on record.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.720]   So Andy, are you, you think this is true too?
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.320]   - I know, I'm very, very certain that it's in the works.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.640]   I'm very, very certain it's gonna happen eventually.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.600]   I'd be a little surprised if they tipped their hand on it
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.920]   at WWDC. - That doesn't seem
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.000]   the right thing to be for.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.840]   - Because as soon as they show one of those things,
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.880]   if they say it's gonna be available in January,
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.960]   that's gonna cut into three G-I-phones sales.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.040]   - But I think the reason, I think the price point will be.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.080]   - I think that what they're actually gonna do
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.200]   is I think that you're gonna see a longer strategy revealed
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.840]   for the iPhone development kit.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.400]   I think for one, you're gonna see a name change.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.120]   So that just like the iTunes music store
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.320]   became the iTunes store, I think the iPhone development kit
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.000]   is gonna turn into the touch development kit
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.840]   or something like that.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.040]   But I think that's why you showed at WWDC
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.360]   is because you get people developing for it.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.960]   And I think the price point's gonna be different.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.560]   I would own an iPhone and one of these.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.560]   I'm not like I'm gonna put one of the big one up to my ear.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.400]   - It's like, hello.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.760]   - So the thing is, is that I think that the price point
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.360]   is gonna be different, the customer's gonna be different.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.400]   I think it's gonna, if I was gonna price it out,
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   I'd say it'd probably be like $1,000 or 899 or something.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.240]   - That's a lot.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.160]   - Yeah, but the thing is, is that it's a different,
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.320]   it's replacing my day-to-day
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.400]   carrying what I'm gonna carry around instead of a laptop.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.480]   You know, and that's the.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.960]   - Maybe that's why the Air was $1,799.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.120]   Maybe they wanted to set a price
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.320]   that would make a $1,000 device look cheap.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.760]   - Maybe, but I think that,
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.320]   but I think being able to watch big video,
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.400]   like 960 by 540, H.264 is being able to carry it around,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.680]   being able to, and I think that you have to show it at WWDC
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.000]   because I think that the situation is you need people
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.600]   developing for it, 'cause it's not gonna be just
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.760]   developing an iPhone app.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.920]   It's gonna be developing for this thing
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.040]   so that when it gets released at Macworld,
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:01.960]   there's things to do with it.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.800]   - Right.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.720]   - You don't need to show it, that's totally unnecessary.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.560]   All you gotta do is add a new component
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.000]   to the development kit, say in August or September.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.120]   Back when you've gotten that first big surge of 60 days
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.520]   worth of sales on the 3G iPhone,
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.320]   that you can really start to say, okay, now,
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.520]   this is the reason why we're telling you
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.000]   to develop your apps this way.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.720]   This is why we've been giving you all these seminars
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.920]   and I found it all nice.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   - We will get a hint at WWDC.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.120]   - I think we'll push developers that direction
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.440]   if that's what it's gonna happen.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.520]   I think that we'll get a really good tip off.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.360]   I'd be really shocked if we see any working hardware.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.480]   - The only thing that I think is also,
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.200]   my other argument for this is that a larger version
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.440]   of this of the iPhone is basically
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.960]   the ultimate thin client for schools.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.040]   - I think it's great.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.440]   - I mean, it's why you'd wanna be talking about it
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.280]   before the fall.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.080]   Maybe why you wouldn't be shipping it before the fall.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.960]   - Too fragile?
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.800]   I don't know.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.640]   - That's just neat.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.480]   - She drops her iPhone.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.560]   - We were discussing this.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.640]   I don't understand how my iPhone is not,
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.960]   how it's still working.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.280]   I was at a hockey game the other day.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.680]   I'm like cheering and it flies out of my hand,
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.160]   falls down three flights of concrete steps.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.000]   And it's fine.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.960]   I drop it at least five times a day.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.520]   I don't get it.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.840]   And then I was at the, oh, this is actually kind of funny.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.400]   I was at the Apple store and this girl who was,
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.360]   she was a little larger and she said
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.080]   that she sat on her iPhone and it cracked.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.600]   And here I am talking about, oh yeah,
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.800]   I throw mine around all the time and it's perfectly fine.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.560]   She's like, yeah, well, I just sat on mine.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.040]   I'm like, okay, sorry.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.680]   - Just saying that I got two words for you to explain it.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.080]   Clean living.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:39.920]   Carve on your--
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.640]   (laughing)
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.560]   - That large.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.720]   - The time you gave that pregnant lady
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.720]   your seat on the bus,
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.920]   Carmo was listening, said, okay,
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.800]   that entitles you four concrete steps, not five, but four.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.160]   - But every day I drop it.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.000]   I mean, it's--
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.360]   - By the way, I just wanna point out
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.480]   that we're now going to drink
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.920]   Hanson's sugar with natural cane sugar.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.680]   - But I am still drinking diet with natural saccharide.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.800]   'Cause if I drink too much,
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.480]   I can, saccharine doesn't bother me.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.600]   Too much sugar makes my tongue swell.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.920]   I don't know, so.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.320]   - That's actually not even good.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.760]   - What, are you getting that Newton?
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.240]   It just appeared out of nowhere.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.840]   - If it was all screen, if it was all screen,
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.080]   maybe just a little bit bigger than this?
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:18.920]   - That's about the right size.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.760]   - About the right size.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.840]   It would just have just a little bit bigger.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.920]   - That's a message pad 2000 for those of you
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.320]   with long memories.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.120]   - But yeah, wouldn't that be crazy
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.320]   if Apple comes back to the basically--
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.520]   - They call the Newton two.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.960]   - No, I don't think they wanna go--
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.280]   I don't think they wanna bring those--
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.120]   - I think they're--
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:33.960]   - You know what?
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.200]   - I would buy a Newton two.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.000]   I'd be so excited.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.840]   - Yeah, I would.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.040]   Wouldn't there be an nostalgia thing?
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.680]   - We'll bring a Newton back.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.280]   - Yeah, we'd have to watch movies like crawl on it
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.040]   just to complete the nostalgia experience.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.320]   But I think that this larger, I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.280]   I just think the larger screen,
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.600]   I mean, we thought about building one,
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.720]   building a larger screen piece,
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.080]   and I just felt like Apple was so close
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.400]   that we're just gonna wait to develop--
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.240]   - You were thinking about that.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.200]   No, that was a top secret project.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.600]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.520]   - But I think that being able to hang it
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.640]   from in your watch cooking videos
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.440]   while you're in the kitchen,
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.760]   watch how-to videos, watch, you know.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.880]   - Stuff is never taken off.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.720]   - Somebody in the chat today--
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.320]   - It never has, but-- - Let's bring the cube back.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.160]   - The cube.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.000]   - I have a cube.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:14.840]   I still have my cube.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.760]   - I'm so sad I gave my cube to a benefit auction,
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.440]   and I would love to have the cube in here.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.600]   We're gonna have some old stuff in here.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.360]   We have an old radio out there.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.840]   Anyway, I wanna take a break and mention audible.com,
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.920]   and then we're gonna get your picks.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.440]   I don't know if you did a pick for us, Justine,
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.280]   but we'd like to do-- - It's all gonna be something.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.200]   - Think of something you got in minute or two
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.840]   for our software picks.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.600]   - Sickies. - What?
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.760]   - Sickies. - Sickies.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.600]   - There's sickies without the tea.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.600]   - Sickies. - Sickies.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.680]   - Sickies, you just pipe on them.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.880]   They slowly melt away on them.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.680]   - But they're green, not yellow.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.600]   Audible.com is, of course, our sponsor,
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.280]   great place to get your audio books.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.560]   If you listen to podcasts, audio books are the next step.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.600]   If you like podcasts, you will love Audible.com.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.120]   45,000 plus titles.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.000]   All the books you've always wanted to read,
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.880]   classics, non-fiction, business books,
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.240]   self-help books, Audibles, Got 'em.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.240]   At very affordable prices, usually less
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.480]   than the cover price of the book,
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.800]   and you own 'em forever.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.440]   I have an Audible library of 300 books.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.320]   I go back all the time and dip into 'em.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.440]   Andy, you wanna do a pick?
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.160]   Have you been listening to anything lately?
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.560]   - Yes, my pick this week is one that I've,
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.880]   through no fault of the books,
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.840]   I've only made it halfway through in the paperback,
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.720]   and so I've decided, okay, look, I really,
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.040]   I really love the half that I've read.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.600]   And haven't gotten back to it, so I need to buy it
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.480]   as an audiobook.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.000]   It is a book, a classic that a lot of people
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.280]   you're gonna understand, called Titus Grown.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.600]   - Oh yeah. - By Mervin Peak.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.480]   It is the first volume in a three volume series,
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:39.440]   the Gorman Gust trilogy.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.800]   The best way to explain Gorman Gust is that
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.800]   it is, imagine J.R.R. Tolkien with a sense of humor.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.240]   - I've always wanted to read these, I see 'em in the bookstore
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.600]   'cause they have very kind of beautiful elaborate covers,
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.080]   and I've never read 'em 'cause I just never
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.200]   thought I had the time.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.640]   Audible, what a great solution.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.840]   - It was written in the '40s, these books written in the '40s,
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.480]   but they have a really good timeless aspect to them.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.760]   It's essentially about this giant castle,
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.880]   this giant medieval castle that's been,
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:12.920]   that's been ruled by this family for 70 generations,
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.000]   so long that essentially the family has sort of stagnated,
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.440]   the region has also stagnated.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.480]   Now it's just about the dull, drudgery routine
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.080]   of what they've been doing for the past 70 generations,
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.080]   and they've forgotten why they maintain the castle this way,
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.560]   while the carpenters work this way,
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.720]   while the mason works this way.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.120]   It's just because, well, that's the way my dad did it
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.280]   and his dad did it and his dad did it.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:41.280]   Titus Grown is the name of the latest heir to this dynasty
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.240]   and his first year of life.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.480]   A new member of the household staff comes in
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.680]   and starts shaking things up in interesting ways.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.200]   - Now this is the one to start with, right?
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.920]   This is the first-- - This is the very first volume.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.760]   - I just, it's another-- - By the way,
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.840]   everybody will vouch for me.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.320]   - Yeah, I'm excited.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.560]   - This version is on a bridge,
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.560]   you get 17 hours worth of audio here.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.720]   It's read by Robert Whitfield,
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.440]   I recognize the name of not necessarily the voice,
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.080]   as someone who does a lot of really, really good audio books,
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.200]   but I love, this was a gift from a friend
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.200]   like five or six years ago who gave me all three volumes
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.040]   and I keep dipping into it and keep dipping into it.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:22.520]   I love these books where the best sort of gift book to give
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.160]   is the volume of something because you give somebody
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.680]   not just that book, but also a path of,
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.960]   oh great, now I know what to read next,
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.120]   now I know what to read next.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.440]   You hate being in Barnes and Noble or on Audible.com
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.080]   knowing I know I want to read something,
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.240]   I just don't know what.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.400]   It's like standing in front of the fridge with the door open
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.880]   and not knowing what you need to eat right now.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.440]   - Can I put a little bit of this?
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.280]   Would you mind? - Yes, yes.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.000]   - Yeah, 'cause I'd like to, this is,
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.720]   you said Robert Whitfield reading this
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.440]   and this is Titus Grown.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:53.200]   - One, Titus is seven, his confines,
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.120]   Gorgas. - G-R-O-A-N by the way.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.840]   - Suckled on shadows. - Yeah, 'cause he's--
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.640]   - Weaned as it were on webs of ritual
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.640]   for his ears, echoes, for his eyes, elaborate.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.640]   - I love it when they have British readers, I don't know why.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.080]   - I'm not actually hearing anything.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:07.920]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.520]   - I've already played it, yeah.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.600]   - Oh, okay.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.440]   - I'm sorry, I didn't--
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.280]   - I didn't play it for yourself.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.760]   - I didn't even tell you that, I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.600]   - I hope you enjoyed it. - I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.120]   - Happy little private moment there.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.920]   - Wow, I can't wait, I already bought it.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.320]   - No, I did, I hope the folks at home heard it,
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.480]   but I certainly have played it to play it.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.600]   - That's how we're-- - Tell everyone,
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.440]   let's all pause a while while I turn on the table here.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.280]   (laughing)
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.120]   - I'll pass you a episode of "Oh."
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.920]   - Fondered, this is a time for you to go find it.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.320]   - I'll play some more, you'll have to play some more.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.320]   Here we go, play it a little bit more so you can hear it.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.600]   - Right, "I've blood that laughs when the tenets matter,
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.600]   "weep, I've blood that mourns when the seer laws croak
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.600]   "rejoice, oh little revolution in great shades."
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.800]   - See, I could just put that on
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.920]   and listen to that for hours.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.160]   - It just makes you feel smarter.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.240]   - Yeah. - I mean, that's the whole thing.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.200]   - If I talk like this, you'd think I was in tension.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.800]   - I think that's part of what makes me,
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.960]   I've been listening to the Spartans for weeks now
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:01.400]   and I'm halfway through in the second pass.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.600]   And part of it is there's this English accent
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.080]   and it's talking about very important things
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.800]   and I just keep on listening to it over and over again.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.440]   I feel smarter all the time.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.000]   You have to be a little bit careful because,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   you're on a 45 minute drive and you're nearly home
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.080]   so you pull into the drive through
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.040]   and without even knowing,
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.120]   "I'd like a quarter pound down with cheese!"
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:20.960]   (laughing)
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.800]   - Chasing!
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.640]   - Tert!
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.360]   - You will supersize it by this, I am.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.200]   - I was listening to the God delusion
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.200]   and it's read by the author,
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.040]   who whose name escapes me, what's his name?
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.040]   - Richard Dawkins. - Richard Dawkins.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.520]   - He has a great British accent.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.400]   And I said, "Jeffrey, you've gotta listen to this."
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.920]   I told my wife and she started listening,
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.040]   she said, "I can't, it's pretty, I can't,
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.560]   "I can't follow it, I can't, it's too British."
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.160]   So some people, it might bug you.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.120]   So that's why, you know, I--
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.000]   - I almost made that an audible pick
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.840]   but I knew that some people might not like
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.680]   what I said about it.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.880]   - I know, but you know what, the God delusion,
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:58.000]   even if you are a devout, and I think most of our listeners
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.440]   probably are devout, judging by polls,
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.280]   devout spiritual person is a must read.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.480]   I think it's a great book.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.520]   It changed my life.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.680]   But this is the Spartans, I wanna play a little bit of--
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.680]   - You have to think I will make an audible pick
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.920]   and I'll explain why I think about that.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.760]   - Okay, good, good, good.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.720]   'Cause I, you know, it's one of those things you're right,
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.680]   it's controversial.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.920]   But I think, you know, you gotta have critical thinking.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.880]   You gotta have a mind.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.680]   This is the Spartans, I wanna hear the British guy,
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.520]   the Spartans. - One of the words,
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.360]   "Eutopia in 1516 had sparked a very centrally in mind,
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.240]   "but it was an authoritarian, hierarchical--"
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.840]   - He's got little Scots in there.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.440]   - I was about to say, yeah.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.280]   - Oh, that's good.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.880]   - It's really, it's very soothing.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.760]   You can, it's literally, it literally is this book
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.680]   is literally the music video of my,
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.960]   anytime I'm walking around, I'm on the bar,
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.320]   I'm on whatever, I just have the Spartans
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.480]   just kind of floating around behind me.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.320]   And I find that I get, I actually,
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.560]   when I'm listening to music, I get too hyper
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.640]   or I get whatever, and this is just this nice little,
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.800]   I'll be walking through Bristol Farms,
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.720]   doing my little shopping and listening to the Spartans.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.640]   - You can, by the way, on Audible,
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.960]   preview any book before you buy it,
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:06.880]   which I do recommend you do,
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.640]   just to make sure you like the reader and so forth.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.480]   It's a really easy thing,
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.040]   there's got a little play button on there.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.880]   If you wanna get the Gorman, say it, Gorman Gast,
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.160]   Andy, what is it?
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.000]   - Gorman Gast.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:19.840]   - Yes.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.840]   - Gorman Gast, Toad.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.440]   - It's, Titus Grown is volume one.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.280]   - Titus Grown.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.120]   - Titus Grown.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:25.960]   - It's one, yeah.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:26.800]   - Yeah, if you wanna get that,
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.880]   and we'll put a link in the show notes
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.040]   so you can click the link.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.200]   You can get it for free.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.480]   You just sign up for Audible.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.720]   Now this is only for new members,
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.680]   but you go to audible.com/macbreak,
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.480]   sign up there for an Audible subscription,
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.480]   you get a credit toward a free book,
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.480]   that would be a very good choice.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.480]   I can't wait to listen to that.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.040]   I'm downloading it right now.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:42.880]   Very excited.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.040]   That's another neat thing is,
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.000]   you get that desire,
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.120]   you suddenly desire to hear a book,
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:47.960]   what you got in it.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:48.800]   - It does download quickly.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.320]   - I think that's why I love iTunes.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.440]   I think all this stuff should be downloaded.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.520]   Why have to get in the car nowadays,
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.120]   with gas at $23 a gallon?
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.680]   - And here's the worst part is I really do,
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.840]   the problem is I have to fill out,
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.200]   if I buy any books for work,
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.880]   I have to fill out forms and stuff with the receipts.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.000]   But if I buy from Amazon, I don't,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.880]   and I have to admit, all I do is I walk through the bookstore
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.760]   with my iPhone, and I take pictures
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.760]   and I email it to someone, I need you to order these books.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.720]   - Somebody should write an application,
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.000]   I hope somebody's writing an application where you do that.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.120]   If I could order from Amazon from borders,
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.480]   I would, it would be not good for borders,
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.480]   but it'd be really good for me.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.200]   - There's an Android app that'll scan barcodes, I think.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.760]   - I mean, you're looking at a delicious library,
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.200]   Hooktot, to an Amazon order picture.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.200]   - But it should be automatic.
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.880]   - Yeah, yeah, take a picture of the barcode,
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.000]   and it's in your shopping basket.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.160]   I love that, of course, if you write the bookstores,
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.000]   you're gonna, yeah, the bookstores are gonna,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.120]   it would be until they change their business model.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.160]   - And your credit card bill.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.320]   (laughing)
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.160]   - Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.560]   - It would be until they change their business model.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.800]   - And your credit card bill. (laughing)
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.880]   - Yeah, that's a good one too.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.480]   - With the state of publishing, it's saying,
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.760]   I think another thing would be to, like, food kitchens,
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.400]   when people are in the food kitchen to get their free food,
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.640]   that there's a way to get out there and slash their tires,
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.960]   without having to leave the house.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.200]   If you really want to just kick people,
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.000]   where they're absolutely down.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.440]   - Yeah, let's really destroy them.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.000]   And we could take their, take their betting.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.360]   - There's, it's so much easier browsing here than on Amazon.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.320]   (laughing)
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.160]   - All right, you're right.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.920]   I have friends who are independent bookstore owners,
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.520]   and I probably shouldn't be recommending this process.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.160]   - Or even, just go to the information kiosk and say,
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.000]   can I use your computer here to order something off Amazon?
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:21.840]   (laughing)
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:22.680]   - You know, if they had it,
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.560]   - I don't wanna write down the names of these books.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.000]   (laughing)
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   - But now there are, with an independent bookstore,
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.800]   there's an architectural bookstore in Berkeley.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.840]   And when I buy books, there I buy them from them.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.200]   You know, because I'm really excited about having--
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.240]   - You're not buying from a person,
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.240]   and I know the folks, and I talk to them,
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.040]   and they tell me what the new books are that came in,
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.000]   what I should be looking at,
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.880]   and it's the best selection of architectural books,
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.960]   ever collected, and I buy it from them.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.280]   But I'm not borders, is borders is borders for me.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.080]   And there's one right next to us, and as I said,
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.680]   it's just, I just don't wanna deal.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.080]   And I buy a lot of magazines from borders.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.000]   - I don't like it at all. - I think in the long run,
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.520]   that's the future of all of this stuff.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.760]   The boutique, personal stuff,
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.960]   you're gonna always be,
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.240]   'cause you have a relationship with them.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.080]   - Exactly.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.400]   - That's the Cluturain Manifesto.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.880]   - And this is the thing that value added resellers,
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.120]   you know, got upset about when Apple started doing
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.800]   a lot of reselling, and they opened the stores,
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.640]   and they go after enterprise, and everything else,
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   they were like, well, Apple's running into our business.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.880]   And my whole argument was,
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.760]   'cause we were looking at being a value added reseller,
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:16.600]   and didn't bother us at all,
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.880]   because find the niche that you're selling to,
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.840]   and be better than the general application of--
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.680]   - Yeah, I would know to you,
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.720]   if I'm buying a Mac for video production,
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.880]   I'm gonna go to you.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:26.720]   - Exactly.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.000]   - I'm gonna go to somebody who really knows that business.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   - Exactly, and everything will be pre-installed,
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.480]   and it'll be exactly the way you want it,
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.320]   and it'll be lined up the way it should be.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.760]   You know, and those are big businesses, you know,
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.200]   and people, and you can do that,
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.520]   but you have to find, and I think that that is a huge part
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.120]   of what's coming is being able to find those niches
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.560]   and support the niche directly.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.880]   - Let's get to our picks.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.240]   I wanna thank Audible one more time.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.640]   I guess I should say that that's the end
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.600]   of the commercial, Audible.com/MacWake.
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.360]   You know, the problem is we love books too much,
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.640]   and we just like talking about this stuff.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.160]   I keep thinking I'm gonna do a book group,
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.240]   kind of, you know, podcast.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.920]   You can sync up with Oprah.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.760]   - Yeah. - You guys can do
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.600]   a little book show. - Yeah, you know,
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.840]   a Leo book, you know.
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:07.680]   - It'd be fun.
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:08.520]   - Oh, the Leo book.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.360]   - Well, that's what these shows have become.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.960]   That's what this Audible stuff has become.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.120]   - I'll learn how to smoke a pipe
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.080]   if that's what's necessary to be part of that podcast.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:14.920]   - Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:15.760]   - We all have to smoke.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.240]   - Where's my pipe?
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.880]   - I'll have to borrow the tobacco.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.880]   (laughing)
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.000]   - You would do.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.680]   - The thing you need to understand,
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.520]   you fucked wild, but nobody understands about Oscar Wilde
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.160]   is that after Doyley Carte sent him to New York,
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.240]   a different Oscar Wilde came back.
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.960]   (laughing)
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.720]   - All right, let's get our picks of the week.
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.200]   I already did my pick, so I'm off the hook.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.760]   - I got my buzzword.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:40.760]   - I got an off the wall one.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.600]   - All right, Alex, Lindsey.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.440]   - So I, this one is mostly for the--
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.960]   - I'm gonna really just think I go, by the way.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.960]   - Oh, I'm sorry, let me turn that off.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:52.840]   This one, so this pick is really for
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.240]   computer graphic artists listening,
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.400]   but there's a fair number of them.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.800]   And I just have to say it because it was,
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.200]   a lot of us build texture maps.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.120]   So we take pictures if you wanna make something
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.000]   look like wood or stone or anything else.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.160]   You have to go either shoot the textures
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.240]   or you have to try to find the collection.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.640]   And I was building some digital sets
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.960]   and some of the Picsicle Members posted,
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.400]   oh, you should go to aeroay.de.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.960]   And so I went there and I got--
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.800]   - How do you spell that?
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.520]   - Aeroay, it's aeroay.de.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.680]   And this is a, as I said, for computer graphic artists,
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.080]   these are texture maps.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.760]   And what they're designed to do is make your 3D--
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.760]   - You didn't spell that very well.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.760]   - Aeroay, R-R-O-W-A-Y.de.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.560]   It's a German company.
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.400]   - I spelled it A-E-R-O.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.840]   (laughing)
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.680]   - Let's get in there.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.400]   - So the A-R-R-O-W-A-Y.de.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.240]   And now what these are is they're just pictures.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.160]   They're pictures of stone.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.000]   They're pictures of brick.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.080]   They're pictures of, they are the best,
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.880]   they are the best texture maps I have ever seen.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.360]   - Are these real or are they a--
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.360]   - No, they're photographs.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.600]   So those are all the things you're seeing on this website
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.960]   are all 3D renders of using these textures.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.840]   So the textures are just little 2D images.
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.480]   And they're mapped onto the 3D--
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.920]   - So you buy the texture.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.520]   - So you buy the texture so that when you build
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.640]   your digital set or you build your digital mat
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.720]   or you build these other things that you can use these,
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.960]   they're just a flat texture.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.800]   - Oh, look at that, that's beautiful.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.720]   - And they are so well done.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.600]   And they're not that expensive.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.640]   They're very cheap actually compared to a lot of other ones.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.160]   I've never seen any quality, any of the same quality
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.520]   anywhere near this price.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.360]   So--
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.160]   - And you buy it by the disc.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.000]   - You buy it by the disc.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.680]   So you buy like concrete for 49 euros or whatever.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:48.760]   But the incredible quality with these,
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.800]   if you're building digital sets,
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.040]   or if you're building digital mats,
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.240]   if you're doing any kind of 3D
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.600]   where you need to create a really realistic looking environment,
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.920]   this is really the best solution out there.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.240]   Anyway, so I was just so excited to find out.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.200]   I know that only a handful of our listeners
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.920]   will be as excited as I am.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.280]   But as someone who's created a lot of these maps,
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.880]   we sell texture map discs.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.600]   Not ones of specific things,
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.040]   but I've created a lot of these maps.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.760]   And these are the best ones that I've seen so far.
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:17.800]   - You know, I make a point when I see
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.040]   an interesting texture grabble.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.240]   I take a lot of just close up pictures of textures.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.920]   Maybe it was you who taught me to do that,
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.080]   but there's really handy--
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.040]   - Especially for web design when you want a backdrop.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.680]   - And this stuff is all seamless,
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.120]   so if you set it up on,
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.280]   it'll go across the back, your page,
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.720]   really, really cool stuff.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.200]   So definitely check it out.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.200]   - A-R-R-O-W-A-Y dot-D-E-A-R-O-A.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.640]   - And now it's your turn, Mr. Andy Naco,
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.560]   your pick of the week, sir.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.000]   - My pick of the week is actually,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.120]   it's kind of a callback to what we're talking about earlier,
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.480]   about simplifying word processors
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:53.440]   so that they just address the features
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:56.000]   that you really, really want to stop over complicated things.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.640]   I came a really cool retro audio recording app
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.600]   called Tape Deck that now,
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.400]   kids out there, those of you who are younger than 30 years old,
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:11.400]   you will not know what our dad's radio shack tape recorder
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.520]   looked like.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:16.080]   It was a popular item in which you put a cassette in
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.000]   and there was a bank of buttons, mechanical buttons,
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.760]   who would punch down to record something
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:22.160]   and play back and fast forward, rewind.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.440]   And Tape Deck takes that exact same metaphor
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.600]   and just makes it into the simplest and most useful,
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.000]   one of the most useful audio recorders that I've ever seen.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.160]   When you want to record something,
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.440]   you press the record button and it starts recording.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.680]   And how do you know that's recording
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.720]   as you're nervously conducting your interview
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:38.800]   or attending your seminar
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.920]   and you don't know what is actually saving stuff or not?
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.680]   Well, because if you look at the little spindles
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.800]   on the cassette-- - The cassette's are turning.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.840]   - You see it's actually turning.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.720]   Not only that, but because there's more tape
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.400]   on one spindle than the other,
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.600]   that means that they're actually spinning
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:51.960]   at different speeds.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.560]   - Oh man. - So that's a good touch.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.440]   - Oh man. - You want to stop,
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.880]   you just press the stop button.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.560]   Not only that, but when you stop,
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.080]   there is actually a tray filled with all the cassettes
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.600]   you have recorded, so to speak.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.080]   So if you want to know, oh, where's that meaning
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.200]   that I attended last week?
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.440]   Push a button, shoot this drawer slides out
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.240]   and you can see the cassette from four days ago.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.160]   - This is what the Photoshop-- - That's what the Photoshop--
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.000]   - where it should look like.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.080]   - This is cool. - Yeah.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.040]   - Again, it's simple, it's effective.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.640]   When I'm recording, I'm using it now to record my podcast
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.160]   because I don't need to record it in GarageBand.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.000]   GarageBand is way too complicated,
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.400]   way too much with Powerhog.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.520]   I'm sick and tired of being like 23 minutes in
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.840]   and suddenly says, oh, I'm sorry,
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.600]   I already got a resource and I'm gonna have to,
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:31.280]   I'm gonna have to do something really stupid
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.760]   to your voice door to make a record some more.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.480]   The only thing that I would like to see tape deck do
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.560]   for 2.0 or for 1.5 or 1 for that matter
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:42.720]   is right now it looks like the shoebox size tape deck
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.440]   that again my dad used to have.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.920]   What I would like it to do is to,
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.200]   now it's adorable, I love it, good motif,
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.520]   but it takes up too much space to make it look like
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.320]   one of these old fashioned machines.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.120]   What I wanted to do, if I'm not saying
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.880]   abandon the tape deck before, what I'm saying is that
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.480]   Sony used to make a version of the Sony Walkman
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.200]   that could record, okay?
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.240]   So it's about the size of a compact tape player.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.160]   So make a version that looks like that
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.560]   has the same sort of indicators,
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.800]   has the same sort of buttons,
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.080]   but takes up less real estate on my screen.
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.000]   So I can see if I'm trying to look something up behind it
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.520]   while I'm actually doing recording,
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.400]   I can actually tuck that someplace on the screen.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.400]   Again, the best feature of this is simply the fact
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.200]   that I can nervously look at that screen and say,
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.800]   okay, the spindles are moving.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.760]   I'm, that means that says to me that this thing is recording.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:32.080]   I don't for simply trust that this thing is saving correctly,
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.120]   but it's 25 bucks, you can try it for free.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.440]   And if you do lots of recordings,
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.360]   whether it's meetings, whether it's podcasts,
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.520]   public speaking, whatever,
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.400]   it's a really, really good app to have.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.000]   - Now how would you compare this to something
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.160]   like Wiretap Studio?
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.760]   - It's less complicated than Wiretap Studio.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.120]   It really does take me,
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:54.600]   it's not that Wiretap Studio is really difficult to do.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.360]   Wiretap Studio is designed to record audio
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:01.320]   from any source that's happening anywhere inside your Mac.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.200]   If you just wanna record directly to disk,
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.160]   it's a little bit more complicated
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.280]   than simply pushing a button,
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.880]   because at least the last time I tried it,
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.360]   which was a few months ago,
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.880]   you simply, you had to basically tell it,
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.160]   oh, by the way, I don't wanna record it
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.080]   from any specific source,
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.200]   I just wanna record it from the microphone and do that.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.480]   It's also, I also like, again, tape decks feature,
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:24.640]   I don't have to go looking for where it recorded something.
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.800]   I can just simply touch a drawer,
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.720]   click on a certain, a dual representation of a recording,
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.040]   and it simply pops out for me.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:33.880]   - Okay.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.240]   - And it's very slick, I think apps.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.320]   That's one of the things,
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.720]   when the Mac first came out that made it so cool,
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.840]   is that things would look like they were, you know?
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.400]   And I think it's nice to see stuff still do that.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.400]   That's called tape deck.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.400]   - Also, it is from tape.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.720]   - How about, go ahead.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.320]   - I'm sorry, I'm trying to remember
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.880]   how much Wiretap Studio costs.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.720]   - It's more than 25 bucks.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:53.720]   - It's more than 25 bucks, I think.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.400]   It's got a lot of other features to it.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.240]   - Exactly.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.120]   - And it may be more, once again, it may be heavier,
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.880]   but when you put it in, it's basic little form,
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.400]   it's this super little recorder that's really nice.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.600]   So, but I, you know, it's,
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.040]   when you were talking about this being taken up
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.760]   too much real estate is why I thought of it.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.600]   - Okay.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.640]   - The Wiretap Studio is just this wee little recorder
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.120]   that does have a lot of the stuff kind of set up for you.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.600]   - It's like a little bit of a fob.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.440]   - Yeah.
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.960]   - Yeah, the purchase price of Wiretap Studio is $69.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:23.800]   - Right.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:24.920]   - So, yeah, if you just need recording,
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.280]   then it's definitely a better,
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.560]   tape deck is definitely better solution.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.080]   If it were the same price,
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.520]   I might say for the extra features,
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.120]   by all means, but save yourself some money.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:32.960]   - Right.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.200]   - But, and the other, and just to be fair,
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.360]   the other competitor to tape deck
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.320]   would be actually QuickTime Pro,
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.160]   - Right.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.600]   - Which gives you a simple little,
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.840]   it basically undims a lot of the basic features
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.240]   that you find in QuickTime Player,
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.080]   including create a new audio recording,
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.440]   create a new video recording,
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.000]   simple cut and paste editing,
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.240]   and QuickTime Pro costs $4 more,
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.760]   but it's not quite the same sort of experience.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.840]   - Well, the thing is that you,
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.760]   the other side of it though is that,
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.960]   I mean, almost anybody that has a Mac
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.280]   should own QuickTime Pro as far as I'm concerned.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.200]   So you're kind of getting it,
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.320]   I mean, you should have QuickTime Pro,
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.600]   'cause there's so many other things you can do with it.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.360]   And this is probably just using Core Audio
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.200]   the same way the QuickTime Pro is,
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.280]   but it's giving you a really cool interface to do it.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.240]   - I like the interface a lot.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.080]   - Yeah.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.800]   - If I were in the, if a big part of my,
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.360]   of my work wig was simply recording audio
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.200]   from a microphone or recording, like again,
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.440]   recording lectures, recording podcasts,
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.200]   I would prefer to use tape deck to QuickTime Pro.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.960]   I do have both apps, my MacBook,
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.360]   and I do prefer to use tape deck.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.000]   - Oh, I don't like to use QuickTime Pro to record.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.360]   I was just comparing it, I don't.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.200]   - Right, yeah.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.040]   - But your good recommendation on QuickTime Pro,
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.440]   I mean, it is one of those things that,
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.640]   it kind of thinks that something that you think
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:42.800]   that Apple should give you for free
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.800]   is something you have to actually register for,
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.360]   but yeah, there's so many times when
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.960]   the solution is simply QuickTime Pro.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.240]   - Now, sometimes it gives you a little too much power.
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.520]   One thing that we're trying to figure out
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.920]   is we have a movie that somebody hit cut
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.440]   at the, in the beginning of the video,
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.880]   and then they, and then they saved.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.360]   And now we're trying to figure out
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.000]   all the data is still there and the quick does.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:03.840]   - It is?
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:04.680]   - It's all there.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.000]   - The trim is not, the,
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.040]   the trim, until you do a save as,
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.680]   the trim is still there, but we can't figure out
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.720]   how to get the movie back.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.920]   It's like it's all sitting there.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.640]   There's some little hex code somewhere,
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.120]   and we were told to use this hex editor
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:15.960]   to try to find it.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.800]   - It's hitting.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.960]   - And, and there's some little,
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.040]   there's some little knob somewhere that just says,
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.160]   stop playing here, all the video is still there,
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.720]   but we can't, we can't actually get to it.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.680]   - tapedeckapp.com.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:27.520]   - I like that.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.480]   - I mean, yeah.com, and it's free.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.880]   - Do, tax, or I, 25 bucks a five.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.600]   - We try, right, yeah.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.440]   - Very cool.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.880]   Merlin Man, Merlin Man.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.960]   - There was a post I ran across,
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.120]   I think on one of the popular aggregation sites
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:45.600]   on a site called comicbookresources.com,
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.960]   and they had this really cool list
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.240]   of the top 100 comic book runs of all time.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.040]   And, - We're all typing comic resources.com.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.280]   (laughing)
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.480]   - Just one.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.520]   - Comic runs, and you'll see it.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.640]   Anyway, I was just, I don't know, it made me nostalgic.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.160]   For, I was never a big comic book guy,
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.520]   but I enjoyed it well enough when I was a kid.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.120]   And, and the number two,
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:11.040]   the number one was, I think, the Watchmen,
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:13.920]   but number two was this run of the X-Men
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.840]   from about, I think about 1977 to about 1980 or so.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.320]   And it made me really nostalgic and wanted it.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.680]   So I went onto Amazon and I picked up,
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.320]   if you want a recommendation, a great recommendation.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.160]   If you like the Uncanny X-Men, the second X-Men,
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.640]   this X-Men omnibus is this huge, like,
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.880]   four inch thick, beautiful X-Men comic book collection.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.120]   Anyway, I was kind of, to be perfectly honest,
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.880]   I didn't feel like waiting.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.320]   And so I had been casually aware that there are things
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.960]   out there that will let you find comic books out there.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.080]   And there's a format actually called
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.080]   Comic Book Archive File.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.000]   - You're kidding.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.240]   So people scan them into this file format?
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.320]   - Yeah, and there's actually like a pretty rich format
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.080]   for what it's called, so it depends on the compression.
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.360]   According to Wikipedia, CBR, CBZ, CBT,
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.160]   the ones I had were mostly CBR.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.360]   Anyway, long story short, there's a reader.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.960]   And I cannot believe that Andy has not done this as a pick,
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.080]   but I checked with him and he said he hadn't.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.840]   Comic Book Lover is a program.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.480]   They call it iTunes, they quote Macworld,
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.040]   and saying that it's iTunes for digital comics.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.320]   And that's exactly what it is.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.800]   You take these CBT files, or CBR files, or whatever,
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.840]   and drag them into Comic Book Lover.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.200]   And it's a really nice full screen viewer
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.280]   for looking at comic books that you've gotten online.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.040]   And it's really easy, you can have smart groups,
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.560]   you can do all kinds of things with organizing.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.840]   I mean, you know, in a way, on the face of it,
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.240]   it just seems like kind of a glorified version of preview.
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.040]   But it also has neat stuff.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.800]   So these are all scans of old comic books,
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.640]   for the most part.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.160]   So you've got stuff like you can change the white balance
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.240]   and the color, and so you can change the amount of contrast
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.400]   or brightness.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.360]   And if you've got a nice big screen still,
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.680]   it's not nearly as fun as holding the books in your hand.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.280]   But it's a really pretty application,
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.760]   I think is very well done.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.880]   It costs, I bought a copy.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.720]   I wanna say it's in the $30 or so.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.560]   $24.95, which would be what?
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.240]   One, 280th of an Alex, is that right?
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.160]   (laughing)
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.000]   - Something like that.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.680]   - One 28, one 28, Alex.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:12.120]   I skipped orders of magnitude.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.120]   You're right.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.040]   But anyway, it's a great application, comic book lover.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.720]   And if you're the kind of person who wanted to,
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:19.960]   you could go out and search around for various
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:23.360]   collections of comics that are out there.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.520]   - Yeah.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.520]   - And anyway, yeah, so what do you say?
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.480]   And you're not a huge fan of digital comics.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:29.920]   - Well, no, no, I am a huge fan of digital comics.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:34.080]   I love, I'll give you the altruistic reason first.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.720]   I mean, Marvel and DC, the big publishers,
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.560]   they only reprint comics that they think
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:44.040]   that are already pretty popular in their original floppies
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:49.040]   or considered classic runs or that they've got a new series
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:52.560]   Marvel is their latest flight of insanity
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.200]   is to basically tell everybody that every superhero
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.360]   you've seen for the past 30 years
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.840]   has actually been a scroll warrior in disguise.
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:01.040]   So they're bringing dead characters back.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.720]   They're saying characters that you thought were alive
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:03.560]   are actually dead.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.760]   It's blah, blah, blah.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.720]   But now they're bringing out a trade paperback
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:11.640]   every storyline that involved the mighty scroll empire,
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.920]   which is great, but it means that lots of other runs
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.720]   are being ignored.
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:16.800]   There was a great series in the '80s
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.080]   called the West Coast Avengers
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.480]   that I thought was, I'd appreciate it really, really good.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:23.000]   It is never going to be reprinted.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.040]   It's never going to be recollected
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.800]   because there's no money in it.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.080]   However, if you go to these bit torrent sites,
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.560]   you can download the--
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.400]   - It's a comedy.
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.240]   It's torrent.
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.600]   How do you spell that?
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.480]   (laughing)
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:35.600]   With a T.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.240]   P-I-R-A-C-Y.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.680]   - F-E-T-E-R-A-R-A-C to the Y.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.440]   But the way to justify this is that to say that
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.320]   it's good to let these things continue to live on
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.160]   rather than simply let them just crumble and die.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:57.160]   I haven't really gotten into digital comics as a whole
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:01.400]   only because Marvlin DC have been really going after sites
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.120]   that are hosting these libraries.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.280]   Demonoid used to be one of the best ones out there,
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.320]   but then suddenly every single library
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.400]   just sort of disappeared all at once.
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.840]   It's downloading them as very, very fast,
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:14.320]   like all bit torrent projects,
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.880]   of anything that's not like immediate
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.720]   and current and insanely popular.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.040]   I mean, if you get, if you want last week's episode of Lost,
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.720]   you can download it pretty much as fast
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.080]   as you can download a quick time.
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.440]   But if it's something more obscure
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.280]   that very few people are seeding,
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:29.040]   I actually have a screenshot that I put on my blog
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.040]   about why I don't think that,
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.160]   I don't believe that piracy of comic books
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.320]   is really gonna be a big problem
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:36.080]   because I wanted to download,
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.040]   again, the entire run of West Coast Adventures.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:41.320]   I have a download status window that says,
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:45.800]   downloaded like 8K predicted end to go,
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.560]   download will finish in eight days, 12 hours.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.400]   - Zero zero is like a month.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.240]   - Zero zero is 500 liters, something like that.
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:53.000]   - It's like the Mighty Python sketch,
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.560]   the Olympic hide and seek, you know,
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.800]   10 years, 43 days.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:00.280]   So that's why, and also I have a problem
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.520]   with the main reason why people are using this service,
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.560]   which is to avoid buying comics.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:08.360]   Today is Wednesday, today is free comic book day.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.080]   If you're in Eastern Massachusetts,
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:13.200]   go to Waltham on Moody Street,
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.800]   the Outer Limits, Talk to Steve,
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:17.040]   Best Comic Bookshop in Eastern Massachusetts.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.560]   And the guy is gonna be losing,
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.800]   but he was actually worried about it.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.440]   He was actually asking me when I came in with a Kindle
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.160]   saying, is that gonna be a problem for me?
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.240]   That people are gonna be starting stopping to,
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.720]   are not gonna be longer gonna be shopping
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.040]   for comics here in the store.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:30.440]   They're gonna start trying to download them.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:31.960]   I had to explain to them the well,
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.280]   people are already doing that right now.
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.560]   If you're not feeling a bite already,
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.760]   then well, it might be kind of okay.
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.040]   I just don't think piracy is a really,
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.200]   it can be a useful thing.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.400]   It can be good for saving stuff that might otherwise be lost,
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:46.560]   but I don't like to endorse it as an ongoing thing.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.720]   Your default position should not be,
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:51.880]   gee, the new copy of a true story swear to God,
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:54.240]   the new copy of You Soggy, your Jimbo came out today.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.760]   I'll download it, your rim post should be,
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.040]   no, I'll go to the store and I'll buy it,
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.000]   'cause that's how you get more comics.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.680]   - There you go, more promise published, I mean.
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.000]   - There you go.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.720]   - Hi, Hachi, just mentioned in the chatroom
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.000]   that ours technica is reporting
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000]   that WWDC is sold out.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.600]   So that shows how much interest there is from developers.
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.120]   I didn't know there was a limit.
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:12.960]   - I didn't know either.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:13.800]   - That's interesting.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:15.560]   - I didn't know you could sell out math at WWDC.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.720]   - That's great.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.960]   - Yeah, it's gonna be interesting.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.640]   - What a transformation this has been,
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.840]   and from for the Apple back in touch.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.520]   I mean, I'm sure there were WWDCs
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.920]   where you couldn't sell, you couldn't give away tickets.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:28.360]   - It was, there was a time when it was a little bit drier.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.200]   - Yeah.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.720]   - But it's gonna be a big, it's gonna be a big WWDC.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.720]   - All right, let's see.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.080]   I already did my pick, which was Buzzword,
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.200]   so I think it's, I just Dean's pick.
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.600]   - All right, well actually I have two,
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:40.440]   just real quick.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.280]   - Good.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.480]   - Twitterphone.com.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.240]   - Twitterphone, that was what you use on your iPhone.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.760]   I thought that you have any more invites left.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.720]   - I actually have five invites right now
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:48.560]   that they just gave me.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.200]   - Okay, four I've four, 'cause,
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:51.280]   (laughing)
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.120]   Alex wants one here.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.680]   Leo, do you want a Twitter phone invite?
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:54.920]   - What, does it require an iPhone?
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.480]   - Twitterphone with an F.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.840]   - Look, it's got a picture of you on the front.
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.560]   That's not Twitterphone.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.560]   - That looks like anywhere girl.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.840]   - Twitterphone with an F.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:02.680]   - It is anywhere girl.
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:04.320]   - Anywhere you go where you mistype the page.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:05.160]   - Look, you have to come up with a backpack,
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.240]   that's not you, right?
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.960]   - That's what the, that's what the PH.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:08.800]   - That's a domain squatter.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.640]   - It is a domain squatter.
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:10.960]   Twitterphone, F-O-N-E.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.280]   - Twitterphone, and it's really cute,
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.720]   and it's extremely simple,
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:16.320]   and the sign up process, well, once you get an invite.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.160]   - So what happens, you have to get an invite.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.720]   - You call, it's like what's up, you know, whatever,
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.240]   and you just, voice translation, straight to Twitter.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.360]   - And it puts text in Twitter.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.200]   - Yeah, no, I know.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.120]   - 'Cause what I really hate on Twitter
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.320]   is where people say, you know,
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.520]   click this to hear my Twitter message,
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.280]   or click this to see my Twitter picture.
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:32.120]   - No, it's translated.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.280]   - It's giving you, it's an accurate job?
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.040]   - Yeah, it'll translate it up to,
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:35.880]   - Did you just do it?
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:36.720]   - No, I mean, I can.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.560]   - Do one right now, let's see.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:38.640]   - 'Cause they're like somebody in the Philippines,
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.760]   it's like typing madly.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:46.760]   - No, but it's really cool, and it's kind of funny,
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.240]   because sometimes it miss.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.240]   - Gets my words here, so I think I said--
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.240]   - Jot does that too, every once in a while.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.040]   - Yeah, well Jot, no, but Jot's people.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:53.880]   Jot's guys.
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:54.880]   - Jot's people?
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:55.880]   - Really?
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:56.880]   - Yeah, no, Jot is people sitting there with headphones.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.880]   - I feel like it's soiling green.
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:58.880]   Jot is people?
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.880]   - No, no, say it, say it really, really, really,
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:00.880]   and spell it out, and yeah.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:01.880]   - They'll always get it right.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:02.880]   - Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:03.720]   - 'Cause I said Kaiser, and it spelled a KYZER,
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:04.720]   and I thought, well, that's really smart for a computer.
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:11.720]   - It's a mechanical turf.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.720]   - Well, since AT&T is not currently working for me,
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.720]   because we all have our iPhones, no, it's not working,
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:18.720]   but--
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.720]   - AT&T is down.
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:22.720]   - AT&T's been down for this whole show, at least in this area.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.720]   - No, it was down in the office.
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.720]   We couldn't call, Justine and I both were trying to--
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.720]   - And I even--
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.720]   - You don't think something called American telegram
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.720]   and telephone would be down?
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:32.720]   - It's seriously, it's tragic.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:33.720]   - Wow, can I call it from here and do it?
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720]   - It does let you do this as well.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:37.720]   - John has it as well, but Twitter phones--
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.720]   - I already have a Jot account.
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.720]   So, is anybody in the Stick 'Em Chat Room equipped
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:43.720]   with a Twitter phone account?
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:44.720]   - Working on a Twitter phone?
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:45.720]   - Just fine.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:46.720]   - AT&T is working in Chicago.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.720]   - It'll show, the bars will show, but if you have to--
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:49.720]   - Yeah.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:50.720]   - Trying to call someone.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:51.720]   - I even tried calling you from this one, and it still didn't work.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:52.720]   - Still didn't work?
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:53.720]   - Mm.
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:54.720]   - But yeah, I know, I mean, it doesn't actually have
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:57.720]   Leet speak yet, because I said "poning noobs"
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:58.720]   and it said "pulling noobs."
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:35:59.720]   (laughter)
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.720]   - It's a "torna noobs."
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.720]   - It's a "torna noobs."
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:03.720]   - If it said that, it's a human.
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:05.720]   - That's a human trying to figure out what you said.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:06.720]   - I was like, "Um..."
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.720]   - 'Cause that's better than a computer would have done.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.720]   - But it's cool because it'll put the words that it's not sure
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.720]   of what you're saying in parentheses with a question mark.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.720]   - Yeah, it's a human.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:14.720]   - It's mechanical turkey.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.720]   - Pulling, pulling noobs.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:16.720]   - Pulling noobs.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:17.720]   - Pulling noobs.
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:18.720]   - I'm telling noobs, guys, come on.
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:19.720]   - They have this hot.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:20.720]   - They're a huge office to back.
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.720]   - But if you will try it next time, say "poning P-W-N-I-N-G noobs
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:31.720]   and O-O-B-S" and see if it gets it.
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:34.720]   'Cause that's what Jot does.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.720]   Now it totally explains why Jot will always get it right.
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:39.720]   If you're careful and spell it.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.720]   It's a human.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:41.720]   It's made of people.
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:44.720]   So Twitterphone.com, but you have to ask for a...
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.720]   Can they ask for...
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:46.720]   - I have four.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:47.720]   - How are they gonna ask you on Twitter?
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.720]   - At me on Twitter and I'll give them out.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:50.720]   - Okay, let's see the power.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:52.720]   If the power of Mac break weekly live...
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:53.720]   - What's that?
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:54.720]   - I'm gonna ask.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.720]   - So on Twitter, at I just seen me if you wanted to invite
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.720]   and then I'll give those out.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:36:59.720]   - I just...
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:01.720]   - Like we're selling "Diamelle jewelry" on Koo, you see.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.720]   Now we only have three left here.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:04.720]   And we've got to move on to the next thing in 30 seconds.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.720]   - Can I get it to you?
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:06.720]   - Can I get it to you?
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.720]   - Can I get it to you?
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:08.720]   - We've got three.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:09.720]   - Do you want one too?
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.720]   - You want one too?
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.720]   - Twitterphone.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:12.720]   - Maybe.
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:13.720]   We'll see.
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:14.720]   Maybe I can get a few more and we'll make this work.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:16.720]   - I'm sure anybody on the Mac break weekly team could probably get
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.720]   a little bit of this.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:18.720]   - We'll do it.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.720]   - Twitterphone with an afterphone.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:26.720]   - Yes, and you said you had two.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.720]   - Oh, yeah, it's actually not out yet either, but it's called...
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.720]   It's still in development, but it's gonna be an iPhone application.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:33.720]   - She's sitting with it.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.720]   - It's called disco, d-y-s-c-o.mobi.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:37.720]   - D-y-s.
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.720]   - I apologize, there is a swear word on the front page.
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:41.720]   So if you don't like swear words, I'm sorry.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:42.720]   - D- or d-y-c-o.
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:43.720]   - D-y-s-c-o.
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.720]   - Okay, 'cause there's also a d-i-s-c-o.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.720]   - It's gonna be pretty cool because it's basically gonna be using,
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.720]   like, two that'll show up and they'll have their different profiles,
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:54.720]   and it'll be like cover flow, so you can just kind of scroll through
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.720]   to see the people that are nearby, what their interests are,
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.720]   and links to other social networks.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.720]   - So it's like a event, or what is that, bright kite?
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.720]   - It's kind of, yeah.
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:04.720]   - On the front.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:05.720]   - Yeah.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:06.720]   - But it's gonna be a really cool application.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:07.720]   - And it's gonna be a hate ashbury.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:08.720]   - Yeah.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:09.720]   - Your new home.
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:10.720]   - It's my new home.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:11.720]   - Yeah.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:12.720]   Wow, that's cool.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.720]   - I know.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:14.720]   - So that's coming next month, d-y-s-c-o.mobi.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:15.720]   - Pretty sad.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.720]   - And will that require an iPhone?
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:18.720]   - Which, I mean, come on, you guys need to get the iPhones.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.720]   Let's go.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.720]   - I gave mine a dane.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.720]   I'm gonna wait and see what they come out with June 6,
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.720]   or June 9th.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:24.720]   Sounds like there might be something very cool.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.720]   - Hopefully.
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:26.720]   - Let's hope it's not just AT&T.
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.720]   What do you guys think of the notion that they might announce a deal
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:31.720]   that is outside the AT&T room?
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.720]   - I would be very excited.
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:34.720]   I forgot how that was AT&T.
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.720]   - AT&T would have to say, yes, I presume.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:38.720]   - I guess.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:39.720]   I hate AT&T.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:41.720]   - I think they would sell a lot more iPhones if they made it available
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:42.720]   for other carriers.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:44.720]   - Yeah, but then AT&T would be hurting.
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:45.720]   - So what?
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.720]   - No, I don't care.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.720]   - It's the whole contract thing.
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.720]   - Well, we don't know what the contract is.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:51.720]   - Right.
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.720]   - That's, you know, I was talking about Don Risinger on his digital home podcast, yes.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:54.720]   - We've all made assumptions about what the--
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.720]   - We've made assumptions, but nobody's seen the writing.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.720]   Who knows what the outclosas are.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:38:59.720]   - Maybe there's some way out.
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:00.720]   - Because it's just--
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.720]   - This is ridiculous.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:03.720]   - Yeah.
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:07.720]   - I'd rather say just so easy to unlock the iPhone that it may as well not be unlocked.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:08.720]   Not be well.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:09.720]   No kidding.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.720]   It's funny.
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.720]   - Questions, if you go to one of these countries that has it unlocked
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.720]   and you bring it back here, can you just use it on T-Mobile?
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:19.720]   - I mean, you can always hack it too if-- which I'm about getting to that point.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:20.720]   Sorry, Steve, but--
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:21.720]   - That's an interesting question.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.720]   - I know guys who have hacked their iPhone to run on T-Mobile.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.720]   - I was running mine on T-Mobile, fine.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:25.720]   - Yeah.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.720]   - If it's a truly unlocked phone, absolutely.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:31.720]   There was-- scalpers are an alert for WWDC now.
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:32.720]   - I don't know if there's the new--
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:33.720]   - We could--
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:34.720]   - Oh, you're a new Boston store.
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:35.720]   - Oh, my, my, my.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:36.720]   - Everyone's really cool.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:37.720]   - Have you been in a Boston store, Andy?
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.720]   - Uh, they're in Hangza's sad tale.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:41.720]   - Uh, uh--
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:42.720]   [laughter]
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:49.720]   - The good-- the good news is that I got a phone call from Apple at 745 in the morning, just
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:55.720]   like someone just really, really beside themselves with like shame and embarrassment because they
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:59.720]   sent my invites and my information to an email address that she had, like from three years
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.720]   ago that hasn't been used for two and a half years.
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.720]   So if I'm lucky, they're going to raise a special tour for me tomorrow afternoon before
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.720]   the store opens.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:13.720]   Otherwise, I'm just going to be home like watching Judge Judy or something and crying and eating
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:14.720]   hot ganuzzi.
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:15.720]   [laughter]
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.720]   - Well, we're in a-- they had a media preview this morning.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.720]   Unfortunately, I had to crank on a deadline.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.720]   I didn't-- I didn't know about it early enough to adjust my schedule, so oh well.
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.720]   - I would like to close this session.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:31.720]   First of all, by thanking all of you, thank the-- Justin Azerak, who-- I hope will now that
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.720]   you're in the neighborhood will be made a little bit more common place around the Twit Live.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.720]   We love having you in studio.
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.720]   And we will soon have-- it'll be a little bit cleaner.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.720]   Somebody sit on stick-amp, clean your desk, Leo.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:43.720]   [laughter]
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.720]   - It will be a little bit cleaner.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.720]   And I also want to thank-- point people to which one-- tasty blog snack, Mommy Pack My
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:51.720]   Lunch, where should we go?
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.720]   - I'm actually going to be relaunching iJustine.com in the next--
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.720]   - That's going to be the place.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.720]   - Month or two, yes.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:58.720]   - I, Justin, I-J-U-S-T-I-N-E.com.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:01.720]   - Follow her on Twitter, of course.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.720]   Mr. Alex Lindsey also came up.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.720]   It was nice to have you, sir.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.720]   - It was a pleasure to be here.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.720]   - I'm caffeinated with your little Diet Coke, sir.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:08.720]   - Exactly.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:11.720]   - And, yeah, I'm just at Alex Lindsey Twitter.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:12.720]   - It's about time that you're on Twitter.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:13.720]   - I'm almost-- I'm seriously--
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:14.720]   - Seriously.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.720]   - Plus, it was like-- it's crazy when people are actually watching the video, because I'm
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:18.720]   almost to the big 3,000, so I'm--
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:19.720]   - That's a big number.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:20.720]   - That's a big number.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:21.720]   - I remember when I went across three south.
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:22.720]   - I know.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:23.720]   - Long time ago.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.720]   - Yeah, that was-- that's way back.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:27.720]   I can't quite see it back there, but there was a time when I got three south.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.720]   - Well, no, you're funny thing is I actually credit Justin with getting me back on Twitter.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:31.720]   It was at Blog World.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:32.720]   - Yep.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.720]   - And she said, "Why aren't you on Twitter anymore?" and I said, "You're right.
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:36.720]   I really should be.
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.720]   That's where everybody--" all the cool kids are.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:38.720]   You know what gets me?
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.720]   That Kevin Rose, who was about to eat my lunch, by the way, or drink my milkshake,
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.720]   as the kids would have it.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.720]   - I'm going to drink.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.720]   - Yeah, he's going to take over at number one spot.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.720]   - Yes.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.720]   - Eight minutes now.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.720]   - Yeah, he just--
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.720]   - Well, he's giving away stuff and they're pushing--
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:51.720]   - Oh, really?
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:52.720]   - Nation, I don't push mine at all.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.720]   - Yeah, well, Alex, he's on it too.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:54.720]   - Alex also.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.720]   - Yeah, I don't--
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.720]   - They'll be number one and two on Twitter soon.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:02.720]   - I don't understand, is Twitter's a competitor to his company, Pounce.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.720]   - Well, but I think the thing is too, is people are using both, but for different things.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.720]   - Yeah, I'm a boss.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.720]   - You share the media and stuff like that on Pounce.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:09.720]   - Do you use Pounce for that?
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:10.720]   - Yeah.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:11.720]   - I do, but honestly, I mean, Twitter is so--
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:12.720]   - You can't really do both.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:13.720]   I'm sorry, you do one or the other.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.720]   - I mean, I'm definitely more Twitter, but I think once Kevin saw the power of Twitter,
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:18.720]   it's--
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:19.720]   - Well, it's a sad statement about Pounce.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:23.720]   If Kevin Rose is the number one guy on his competitor's site, it's--
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:24.720]   I mean, that's a lot, don't you think?
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.720]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:28.720]   - I think it's a good bit that I-- I've approved Twitter for a long time, probably too long.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.720]   - You did.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.720]   - I was like, "Fucking russian."
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.720]   - I did, I did.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.720]   - And now I'm a-- I really enjoy it.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:36.720]   You know, I just-- it's just like this big family of people that you know, and--
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:37.720]   - It's fun.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.720]   - And I'm constantly being inappropriate on it, which is part of the fun.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720]   - It's simplicity to it.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.720]   - It's the place that I can be goofy and watch Merlin say things that make me laugh out loud.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.720]   - I love Merlin.
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:48.720]   - Merlin's seriously.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:49.720]   You're my favorite person.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:50.720]   - And Merlin's great because he's not promoting himself.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.720]   In fact, he has--
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.720]   - I do.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.720]   - And recently, where every person who friends me follows me, as we say in the parlance,
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.720]   I send them a delicious order of coconut shrimp.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:02.720]   And I've-- I've had-- it's been fantastic.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:05.720]   And I'm helping the shrimp industry, and it's good for me.
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:06.720]   - So--
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.720]   - That's great.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:08.720]   - The kids win too.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.720]   - You know that shrimp is one of the foremost, deadliest fishing jobs in the commercial fishing industry.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.720]   Do you know how many people you have killed with that promotion?
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:18.720]   - You know how much he has--
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:19.720]   - You know how much he has--
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:20.720]   - On your hands, Merlin's man.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:21.720]   - Do you ever see someone pick a coconut?
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:22.720]   - That is.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.720]   - But what about--
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:24.720]   - What about-- what about--
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:25.720]   - What about firetings?
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:26.720]   - You'll get picked coconuts.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.720]   How hard do you pot a bee?
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.720]   - And then now, shrimp running on a treadmill.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:30.720]   Look on YouTube.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:32.720]   It is the most disgusting video ever.
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.720]   - Well, I've seen kittens on a treadmill.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.720]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.720]   It's a shrimp running.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:37.720]   And it's running with its little legs.
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:39.720]   I will not eat shrimp ever again because of this video.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.720]   I'm-- it's just--
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:43.720]   - The thing that I'm really nice is shrimp towarding--
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:44.720]   - Torning.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.720]   - Shrimp towarding.
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:46.720]   - Yeah.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.720]   - Funny.
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:49.720]   (laughter)
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.720]   - I mean, that's a-- you know, if you should be buying shrimp
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.720]   from that thing--
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:54.720]   - No, it's not--
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:55.720]   - If you start-- if you start--
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:56.720]   - If you start-- if you start--
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:57.720]   - Toring the shrimp.
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:58.720]   - That's the thing that-- that's sad.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:43:59.720]   That's not good.
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:00.720]   That's not good.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:01.720]   - You don't have any control over that.
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:02.720]   It's not right.
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:03.720]   - Yeah.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.720]   Pixelcore.tv, and you've got great podcasts including "Twip"
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:06.720]   this week in photography.
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:07.720]   - That one is going to be--
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.720]   - This week in media, there's a shrimp on a treadmill.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.720]   - There it is.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.720]   There's a little shrimp.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:11.720]   - There's a little shrimp.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:12.720]   - That's a little weird.
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.720]   - Yeah, so-- and we're doing lots of podcasting classes in June.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:20.720]   - Oh, good.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.720]   - I'm teaching them for two weeks, so it's like two weeks of my life
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:27.720]   will be teaching lots and stuff, and it's everything we have figured out so far.
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.720]   - Very cool.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:29.720]   - Very cool.
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:30.720]   - Thank you, Alex.
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:31.720]   - Thank you.
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:34.720]   - Annie Inako at CWOB.com, the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:36.720]   - Oh, yes.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:42.720]   - Also, regularly in the Chicago Sun times, look for him at a Boston Comic Con near you
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:43.720]   and Mr.--
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:46.720]   - I'll be the one to the Boba Fett costume.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:47.720]   [laughter]
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   - Damn, Mountie Honda.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:53.720]   And Merlin Mann, of course, is the host along with Lonely Sandwich and Scott Simpson.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.720]   You look nice today.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:58.720]   You look nice today as-- you look nice today.com.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:44:59.720]   - Look at my friend.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.720]   - Fabulous, funny, wonderful podcast I just love.
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.720]   And he's hot dog ladies, hot dogs ladies on Twitter, which is to see you search for--
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.720]   Merlin, you know, it's better to search for hot dogs ladies, and you'll find him and you
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:12.720]   can follow him.
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:13.720]   And I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:15.720]   We're going to close with the newest Get a Mac ad.
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:16.720]   Have you seen this one?
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.720]   - I haven't seen this one.
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:18.720]   - I haven't seen this one.
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:19.720]   - It's called Sad Soul.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:20.720]   - Hello, Mac.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:21.720]   - And I'm a PC.
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.720]   Well, Mac, Vista's got me feeling down, so I've written a little song called The Vista Blues.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:26.720]   - Oh, I'd love to hear that sometime.
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:27.720]   I have to--
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:35.720]   - So many users are leaving me, and they ain't coming back.
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.720]   Vista's got issues, and it's so glitchy.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:44.720]   They're leaving me for man.
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:47.720]   - Nice touch.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.720]   - It's the other Mac break.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.720]   We'll see you later, bye-bye.
