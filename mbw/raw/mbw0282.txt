[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.440]   that's all about Mac and Tush's and iPhones and all
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.880]   that jazz.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce the panel today,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.680]   starting from my left, Mr. Andy and not co.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.320]   The Celestial Waste of bandwidth in the Chicago Sun times.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.320]   Good hello.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.800]   Love it.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.880]   It is how it will be.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.840]   Love that picture behind you.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.160]   I know it's been an object of fascination
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.160]   since I found it last week.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.320]   Robot Smoke is the question, apparently so.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.400]   And I love-- yeah, I love her hair and a braid.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.240]   That is Fritz Lang's Metropolis.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.280]   And for those listening, a scene from the production
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.680]   back behind the scenes and the woman in the robot
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.400]   suit him in trouble, it's getting a cigarette lit up.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   It's getting a siggie.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.680]   And a blow-dryinger.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.040]   I don't know.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.640]   They had blow-driers back in the '20s.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.520]   Apparently so.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.400]   But they worked on like 280 volts at 130 Hertz
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.120]   or something like that.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.800]   Is that interesting?
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.320]   So they were using the movies long before they
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.720]   were brought to our homes.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.680]   You just don't think about--
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.840]   these images are so iconic, like the Maria
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.080]   robot from the Cropolis.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.280]   You never see, oh, behind the scenes,
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.520]   someone's suiting up in that robot outfit.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.240]   And-- yeah, there has to be.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.640]   It's like pictures of Kenny-- what's his name in the R2D2 suit?
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.360]   Kenny Baker having a sandwich.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.920]   And they got the head off, and he's in there,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.800]   and he's having a sandwich.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.560]   It's just-- there's Teracle.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.000]   Also with us from the UK from Liverpool,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.640]   but soon to be from here, I think he's flying out soon,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.040]   I hope, for Mac, the world.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.360]   Mr. Don McAllister of Screencasts online.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.320]   Indeed, indeed.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.800]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.400]   Thanks for having me on again.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.920]   I saw--
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.880]   Yes, I'm coming up in the fuck world.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.800]   Yeah, I'll be in Tuesday.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.400]   I saw on your path all the stuff you have to do before you leave.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.640]   Yeah, well, it's been a really busy week as well,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.280]   because I've just launched a new website,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.520]   and a new service, and everything.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.320]   And then I've got to create some more shows
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.040]   while I go away.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.120]   So it's a really, really busy time for me at the minute.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.440]   What's the new service?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.560]   What are you talking about?
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.440]   Well, I've just relaunched Screencast online.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.560]   I've just relaunched the website.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.520]   So it's a completely new, brand new, built from scratch website.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.480]   The landing page is the same as it was last year,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.720]   but all the back end, it's now a full sort of content management
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.120]   system, extra features for the members, easy to search.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.800]   But the big thing is, well, two big things.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.840]   One, I've introduced a new weekly iOS tutorial.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.440]   Now, so there's two shows a week.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.960]   Cool.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.320]   So both Mac and iOS completely separate.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.080]   I used to get some sort of flack from existing members
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.960]   who were sort of just interested in the Mac.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.840]   And I was always trying to bring in iOS shows,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.800]   but I always felt a bit strange about it.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.080]   But now I've split them separately now,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.880]   so people can choose for Mac, iOS, or both.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.120]   And then I've also dropped the joining fee as well.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.120]   Really?
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.120]   That's another barrier.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.560]   It's gone to monthly, quarterly, or yearly.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.160]   But I've managed to put the Mac break weekly discount
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   back in place as well.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.000]   So I've set up a special page, screencastonline.com/mbw,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.480]   and they can read all about it there.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.160]   That is great.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   Well, normally we save the plug for the end of the show.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.480]   I'm glad we could get it at the beginning.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.520]   Well, you might be going to find the opportunity again.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.080]   No, no, no.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.440]   I want to.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.120]   This is great.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.600]   Thank you.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.480]   Very kind.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.640]   Screencastonline.com/mbw.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.400]   Yeah, two shows a week.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.440]   So I've got four times-- well, twice as many shows to produce
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.560]   a while and a while next week now.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.760]   So then, well, it's OK.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.600]   Awesome.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.720]   Also with us, Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixelcorpixacorps.com
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.840]   for the Guild of Multimedia Artists and Pixelcorp.tv
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.600]   for your podcast.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.920]   Anything you want to plug?
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.760]   I don't have anything to plug this week.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.480]   I'm just recovering from CES.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   We had a great time.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.120]   And we are--
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.560]   Chris, my partner, has gone to Rwanda.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.000]   Yeah, that's all started as well.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.160]   So hopefully I'll get to do one of these shows from Rwanda.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.960]   I'd love to hear more about that down the road.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.760]   It's very Mac breakage.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.040]   It's all iMacs and iPads, doesn't that neat?
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.880]   So we are gathered together the week before.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.800]   Now, do I call it Macworld or iWorld or both?
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.400]   It's Macworld.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.040]   There's iWorld.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.520]   There's iFAN.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.360]   What's that?
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.480]   That's the separate track that's just for things that
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.720]   are cool people who use Apple and iOS devices
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.920]   to do cool things.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.360]   Like I'm interviewing a couple of animators and producers
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.200]   of South Park now on that stage.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.280]   And they use iMacs to do their thing.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   They use Macs to get a whole show
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.800]   gone together from a blank sheet of paper
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.840]   to actual tape handed over for broadcast in six days.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.280]   And I presume in your interview, you're
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.480]   not going to do a fanboy interview,
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.000]   but you're going to talk about their workflow.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.920]   We're going to be talking about how they get this thing done
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.520]   in six days.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.040]   Unfortunately, we only have 45 minutes.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.160]   And we're setting aside 15 minutes for Q&A,
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.560]   because I know that there's going to be a lot of really
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.520]   good questions.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.000]   But we've already--
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.040]   I did the pre-interview about an hour ago.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.000]   And the first question was, is it OK if we cuss?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.640]   Is it OK if we use the after 11 PM version of certain clips?
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.880]   And the answer, fortunately, according to the IDG person,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.000]   who's on the call, is yes.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.840]   Good.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.760]   So you could see-- this will be South Park Uncensored.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.400]   Yes, at 1 PM on Thursday.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.640]   Ah, I want to see that.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.240]   And since we're doing--
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.120]   plugs at the top of the show, I do have 10 free admissions
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.320]   to the I-fan track.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.760]   So if you are listening live and you
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.680]   can find the correct registration page for that,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.240]   and you use the coupon code ANDI and dy,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.800]   you will get a free admissions to the I-fan track.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.640]   Don't bother, they're all gone.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.680]   Probably, right?
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.320]   How quick can you click?
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.600]   Macworld, I world the ultimate I-fan event.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.440]   It almost feels like they can't figure out what to call it.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   But obviously--
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.840]   It's a festival.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.720]   South by Southwest, it's like, what is it?
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.280]   Well, there's not-- it's not about Southwestern cuisine.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.200]   You got your music, you got your data stuff,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.680]   you got your startup stuff.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.800]   You got your armadillers.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.680]   The San Francisco Mac Base.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.600]   South by Southwest.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.800]   Yeah, but not even Mac Base, because you can't really
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.240]   say Mac Base either.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.840]   It's--
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.600]   They all use Macs.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.840]   It's the Apple ecosystem.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.880]   Yes, mine is actually--
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.360]   It's the same--
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.520]   Well, this new I-fan pass is a lot cheaper
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.840]   than it used to be in the neighborhood.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.080]   And tech box as well.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.440]   So I think they're making it more accessible to people
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.680]   by introducing this I-fan concept.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.080]   So it's a lot cheaper now.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.320]   This is neat.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.960]   You know what's funny?
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.320]   We were at CES.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.080]   Sarah and I were doing iPad Today walking around.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.640]   We came to the end--
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.800]   Actually, there's a big-- there was big eyeliner,
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.160]   like 28,000 square feet of stuff.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.360]   We came to the-- there's something gray wall.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.240]   It's like the end.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.600]   Here it is.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.000]   That's it.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.640]   It's over.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.320]   And who's standing there?
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.440]   But Paul Ken.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.680]   And it was almost like we staged it.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.880]   Like the show's over.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.920]   Oh, and here's Paul Ken.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.120]   Planner of Macworld.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.520]   And he was like scribbling.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.200]   He was like taking notes.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.800]   And I said-- and I grabbed him.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.520]   I recognized him.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.760]   And I think he was kind of surprised,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.480]   but we talked about Macworld.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.040]   So Andy's going to be there with a special South Park event.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.520]   And you're doing another thing, right?
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.880]   Panel.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.360]   Yeah, later that afternoon, I'm going to go through Lion
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.720]   feature by feature and decide which features you should adopt
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.280]   and actually use which ones you should adapt, which
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.160]   is use them, but here are ways to enhance them.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   And then there's the abandoned file.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.240]   The ones that are saying, yeah, you know what,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.640]   I bet there's going to be a 10.8.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.240]   That's going to save you a lot of heartache.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.480]   I like it.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.280]   I like it.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.880]   And Don, will you be speaking or just visiting?
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.360]   Yeah, no, I've got--
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.160]   I'm doing a session.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.600]   I think it's on the Thursday.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.800]   It's on one of the morning sessions,
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.600]   the other Thursday of Friday.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.960]   I'm doing the hidden secrets of QuickTime.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.840]   So a 45-minute session all about using QuickTime and QuickTime
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.680]   captions and subtitles and stuff like that.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.000]   So that should be quite interesting.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.520]   And then I've got a live podcast with the Mac Roundtable
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.200]   Guys and Girls.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.760]   So that should be interesting as well.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.920]   And of course, Alex, you're doing something, I'm sure.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.640]   I'm trying to.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.440]   We are not doing-- I'm not speaking there.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.200]   We are-- I have a shoot that I have to go to.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.400]   So you're working there.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.640]   I'm working somewhere out of 10.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.920]   Well, do I pad the day there?
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.000]   I don't know if we'll do any other content there,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.280]   but we'll be doing-- look for us on the show for Thursday
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.760]   as we wander around Thursday afternoon.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.080]   And then of course, Thursday night, you've
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.560]   got to come to our Mac Break meetup.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.520]   This has become a tradition thanks to Myra Joyce, who
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.200]   is just a fan who just puts these together.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.000]   Thank you, Myra.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.760]   Where is it?
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.640]   God bless you, Myra.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.600]   Thursday, January 26, 6 p.m.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.400]   at the Intercontinental Hotel.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   It's a great hotel.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.440]   I believe it's the same place as if you were there last year.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.000]   Same place.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.560]   Same place.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.840]   And I'm sure the smile on my Mac people will be there.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.080]   And it'll be fun.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.240]   And you just have to walk over.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.160]   It's right next to the Moscone Center.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.960]   It is right there.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.920]   It's right behind Moscone.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.600]   No taxi required.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.080]   I think I'm just going to spend the night.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.960]   That's the best way to do it.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.080]   Last year, I spent the night, but I didn't have a room.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.080]   I just laid out in the curb out front.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.360]   It was fine.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.080]   It's a nice hotel.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.840]   It was clean.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   It's a clean hotel.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.120]   The curb, not so.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.280]   No, I was fine.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.160]   Are you in your bathrobe and your ascot?
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.160]   Yes.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.880]   Testing out your heff-- your heffner concept?
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.400]   Yes.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.000]   It's my new concept.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.240]   Over here, we were in Eman's painting scenes
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.440]   from Apple Expo.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.160]   Apple is the most valuable brand in the world.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.640]   Old world, world.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640]   I guess it depends who you ask.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   Almost.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.040]   It's the most valuable.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.800]   It's most valuable.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.200]   It's most valuable.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.520]   But that's nine spots.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.320]   Was it nine spots?
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.840]   Bigger than Disney, Mercedes-Benz, and Budweiser.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.640]   What do you think the most valuable brand in the world
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.680]   is just before you look at this--
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.880]   just guess.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.560]   The most valuable brand in the world.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.920]   Nike.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.440]   I can guess.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.440]   Ford.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.640]   And the world I can guess.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.360]   Disney in the world who?
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.160]   It's Coke.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.040]   Wow, you're very good.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   Did you know that at the end of time?
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.160]   If you're outside of the United States--
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.160]   Everywhere it's Coke.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:32.840]   You--
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.720]   Chabram knew.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.760]   They're so good.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.160]   The thing about Coke in other areas,
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.680]   they're so good at what they sponsor.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.520]   So all the events in Africa, for instance,
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.840]   that's when I really got how big Coke was,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.360]   is people wear the little Coke, like sweaters,
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.400]   like a V-neck sweater, whatever, like with the Coca-Cola logo.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.320]   That's like a status thing.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.440]   You don't have that sweater.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.120]   And they sponsor everything.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.800]   They're everywhere.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.440]   They're supporting all kinds of stuff.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.080]   When did Coca-Cola come to the UK?
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.040]   Did you-- if you had it your whole life, a daughter?
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.840]   We've had it for a long time.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.120]   Coke and Pepsi.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.880]   The funny thing is, though, with Coke,
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.560]   it's natural to ask for a Coke.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.440]   But normally, if the response is, well, we've only got this.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.280]   I'll go, OK.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.360]   Nobody really cares.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.680]   It's sugar water with some flavor.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.200]   It isn't.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.160]   There isn't a huge distinction between that and anything else.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:15.720]   No, no, don't.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.560]   I'll close your--
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.040]   I remember going to Europe in 1967.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.240]   And maybe in the UK, you could get it.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.040]   But most of Europe, you could not
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.680]   get Coke.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.200]   And they had the weirdest variants
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.080]   with cinnamon on the bottom of the filter out.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.760]   I mean, just-- I remember Africa,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.960]   Africa having some weird--
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.560]   so I think what happened--
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.320]   it was only available in China in the last 15 years.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.880]   I think what happened is, pent up demand.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.400]   Of course, it's huge because it was a status.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.640]   Well, it's also stable.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.120]   I mean, the thing-- because it's a great brand--
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.240]   Joe's the only one you're going to get.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.440]   When you get Coke in other countries,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.560]   what you know is that it's going to not make you sick.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.880]   And Andy, I think, would agree with me that there
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.800]   is a big difference between Coke and Pepsi.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.200]   This is Interbrand's best global brands report.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.120]   I'm not sure what it's based on.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.800]   They actually quote a dollar value.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.160]   The brand value of Coca-Cola is $71 billion, up 2%.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.840]   IBM is number two.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.760]   That's number two.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   That one seems weird.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   But maybe that's because of all the advertising they do
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.120]   on things like the Olympics and big things like that.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.080]   I don't get that one at all.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.080]   Microsoft number three, not in the US, Google number four.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.440]   Everyone uses their browser.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.440]   Everybody uses-- everybody knows Google.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.520]   Worth $55 billion.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.920]   That was up 27%.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   But Apple's the big gainer, up 58%, up nine places to number eight.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.920]   And remember, Apple has never been--
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.040]   traditionally, never been big internationally.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.680]   But in the last two or three years
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.160]   has just come on gangbusters.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.400]   In the radio business, we would call that--
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.200]   Hot.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   Number eight with a bullet.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.280]   What do they call it?
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.320]   The billboards, what do they call it?
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.720]   The hot-- the hot 100 hot 100.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.560]   GE number five, McDonald's number six.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.280]   By the way, notice how many of these companies
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.200]   are American, all of them?
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:04.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.280]   Is this only American companies?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.640]   Blessed global brands.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.960]   They're all American.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.480]   Intel, Apple, Disney, and HP ran out the top 10.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.920]   Does that make you sad, Don McAllister,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.000]   that Jaguar is not on the list?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.720]   It does mention Mercedes Benz, but they're German.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.920]   At least they European some web.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.400]   Mercedes is on the list, but it's not the top 10, yeah.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.600]   Yeah, it's not in the top 10.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   Diamond.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.720]   What can you do?
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.520]   Budweiser's in there.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520]   But they're global brands.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.040]   I mean, we have all these in Europe,
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.280]   so they're all recognizable names to it.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.920]   I think Cadbury should be in that list.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.680]   We all know Cadbury.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.520]   Are they on the list now?
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.440]   I think they're saying for them.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.880]   I think they're on the list.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.440]   I'm not sure.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.600]   Sorry.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.920]   Sorry.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.720]   Anyway, just an interesting story.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.160]   Nothing to say about that.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.640]   Nothing to say.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.480]   Well, it is well, it is kind of interesting,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.800]   because what happens when a brand becomes a character
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.080]   in and of itself?
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.520]   You expect things of it that are
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.080]   go above and beyond the actual things that it does.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   I mean, I think people are--
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.720]   IBM used to be known for personal computers,
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.840]   the notebook computers.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.080]   Now, do they actually produce a service
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.680]   that any consumer actually puts their hands right on?
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.360]   Now, they're basically down to selling services
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.760]   to other companies.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.440]   So there's a lot to live up to there.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.280]   It is a challenge.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.440]   I mean, if you're Tim Cook to know that--
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.640]   I mean, I think anybody runs Apple.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.640]   This was the problem after Jobs left
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.760]   that his successors, John Scully, Michael Spindler,
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.480]   and Gilameleo all faced, which was that Apple
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.440]   was a brand with a life of its own.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.400]   That it transcended the person running it,
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.120]   it transcended their ability to steer the ship there was--
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.240]   and that's because of us.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.640]   That's because of Apple fans, I think.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.440]   And Tim Cook, I think a good successor,
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.560]   although I just saw an article where
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.120]   I see it that said Scott-- probably some rumor blog.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.640]   Scott Forstall is the--
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.560]   I only say he's CEO apparent.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.040]   Yeah, but I mean, I don't know if--
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.720]   But remember, Tim Cook's options go for the rest of his life.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.520]   Remember last week there was talk about, from the LA Times,
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.480]   saying that Tim Cook made $378 million a year?
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.200]   Not true.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.440]   It's all stock options.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.520]   A million shares of restricted stock options
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.760]   were $376 million.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.000]   His salary's $900,000.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.920]   You see the size of his house?
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.480]   No.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.360]   There was an article about it.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.200]   It's like $2,200.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.360]   No, it's like $2,200 square feet or $2,200 square feet.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.680]   It's not-- they said you wouldn't notice it driving by.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.720]   I mean, it's a nice--
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.720]   No, that's smart.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.880]   But it's not-- he said it's like a third the size of the use.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.040]   Yeah, if you have a fancy house, it's just asking for trouble.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.480]   It's asking for home invasions.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.560]   It's asking for people, friends and relatives coming by,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.640]   saying, can I have some money?
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.520]   Don't do it.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.640]   Trust me.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.000]   It's more--
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.520]   After we mention everything changed,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.680]   we had to put up fences everywhere.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.600]   $900,000 performance bonus, $16,000 in contributions
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.840]   to his retirement account and life insurance.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.800]   But the stock options-- and this is my point--
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.240]   will be vested over two five-year periods.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.840]   First half, 2016.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.800]   So he wants this $376 million.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.080]   He's got to wait for the first half, 2016, and then 2021.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.920]   10 years for the second half.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.840]   I think those are good.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.000]   I think that's--
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.840]   It's a lot of money.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.680]   I mean, it's worth theoretically a lot of value.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.360]   But what you're seeing is that's a responsible way
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.640]   to handle high levels of compensation.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.160]   I agree.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.560]   Where you're thinking long term.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.560]   You have to think about--
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.040]   But that means--
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.680]   Where is my brand going to go for the next 10 years, not what
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.920]   am I going to do with it next year?
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.200]   Well, that means the board wants him to stick around.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.240]   I guess is my point.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.560]   That the board is not thinking of him as a temporary CEO.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.760]   He's the CEO for 10 years.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.440]   It's very much a voter confidence, I think.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.160]   And it's not been a snap decision for him as well.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.840]   I mean, he's sort of been there for a long time.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.120]   And I think the past four or five years, obviously,
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.000]   with the 10 of events and what was likely to happen,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.360]   I think that the fact that they've come up with these stock
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.720]   options right after-- and it's for a 10-year period.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.400]   They really have got huge confidence in his abilities
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.160]   and how he's going to move the company forward.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.000]   It's also a pretty clear message to the stockholders
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.560]   and the public that this is not going
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.040]   to be revolving to our CEOs.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.480]   Because like you said, Leo Apple went through that before.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.600]   And boy, did they start to go right into the old flusher
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.480]   after that.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.960]   So this is a statement saying, no, we're
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.760]   going to keep the exact same sort of management
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.360]   that we had before.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.760]   We're going to have one guy at the top.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.280]   But there's not going to be a power struggle.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.840]   And we're not looking to replace somebody after 16 months.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.600]   Now, CBS made a mistake, I think, here.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.360]   I'm looking at this CBS article.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.480]   It says that he already-- Tim Cook already
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.320]   has 13,754 shares in Apple.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.400]   They say that's worth $580 million.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.960]   Unless Apple just went up a lot.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.800]   I think that's--
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.200]   I thought it was $100 million.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.440]   It's not even that much.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.600]   If Apple's 423 bucks a share, it's $5,817,000.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.600]   It's not--
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.040]   It's not going to end up $13,000.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.560]   Yeah, that's not--
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.960]   Yeah, it's not walk away money.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.600]   It's got boring money.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.320]   But the question is, how is he going to live up
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.120]   to the-- he's being paid 990,000 times more than Steve Jobs was,
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.360]   doing the exact same job.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.160]   We're going to see a 999,000 increase
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.560]   fold in performance.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:23.320]   Steve was there for other reasons than money, don't you think?
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.160]   Tim doesn't own 3% of Disney.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.880]   7% I think it's--
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.880]   7%?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.800]   Yeah, some cool.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.640]   And don't forget, they gave Steve a jet.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.120]   They gave Steve other stuff besides--
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.280]   Yeah, it's true money.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.840]   A jet.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.040]   A jet's not so bad.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.560]   He gave you a jet, I'd be quiet for a while.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.480]   I'd stay at Twitter if they'd give me a G5.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.480]   You know, it's not--
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.080]   I wish I could get together in my G5.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.200]   When I close it, I'll mail it to you
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.040]   if people keep those hits on common.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.560]   It's not the-- it's not the jet.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.120]   It's the fuel.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.600]   Forget-- just the--
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.480]   It's G5 and a lifetime supply of fuel.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.320]   That's what I'm holding that for.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.360]   Exactly.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.320]   I'm not going to get it.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.680]   That's what I'm holding that for.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.280]   Let's take a break, come back with more.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.520]   Because I got to pay for that G5.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.360]   And then, we'll talk about the rumors.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.960]   Boy, the rumors are hot and heavy,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.720]   and we've got an Apple event coming up Thursday.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.680]   I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.120]   We were like, oh, I'm a couple weeks ago,
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.640]   but I'm getting--
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.720]   Well, we'll talk about what that means.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.520]   And then the iPad 3 rumors and the iPhone 5 rumors
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.720]   are hot and heavy.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.240]   So we're going to talk about all of that coming up
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.000]   in just a second.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.840]   Before we talk about that, I want to say,
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.240]   hello, small business owners.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.080]   You know how you get from a small business owner
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.360]   to being a big business owner?
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:28.920]   Cashflow.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.520]   Cashflow.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.920]   Money.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.200]   And the trick is-- and I knew this is when I started off
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.360]   in business, is you got to the invoices, right?
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.640]   It is not what you make or how much you make.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.280]   It's when you make it.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.120]   When you make it.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:44.600]   It is.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.120]   You know this.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.080]   It's all about cashflow.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.040]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.760]   So I was so lazy.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.400]   I hated invoicing so much.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.680]   I would invoice not monthly, which you're supposed to do.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.320]   But when I thought about it, which is usually
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.760]   every six months to a year--
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.440]   and of course, my clients would go, I'm not paying you.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.680]   That was last year.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.760]   Dude.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.480]   So this is when I found-- actually, Amber MacArthur
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.560]   told me about this--
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.280]   freshbooks.com.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.880]   Her business had been using it for a while.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.400]   I started in 2004.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.200]   It changed my life.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.960]   Changed my life.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.280]   If you're a small business, this online invoicing system
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.160]   is fantastic.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.960]   You could join 3 and 1/2 million folks who use it
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.680]   since I started in 2004.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.720]   You get paid better.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.840]   You get paid faster.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.880]   Think about all the time you spend creating invoices,
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.600]   dealing with the paperwork.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.200]   That's all gone.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.400]   In fact, if you do hours, billing by hours,
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.160]   they have an app.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.600]   There's an iPhone app, but there's also a web app that will not
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.400]   only keep track of the hours, put it right in the invoice.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.000]   So you don't have to do any figuring.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.640]   They handle all the currencies, which makes it very easy.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.080]   What happens is you create the invoice,
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.840]   you put your logo on it.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.800]   It looks very professional.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.640]   Email it to your clients.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.640]   It's a couple of clicks of the mouse, in most cases.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.800]   It's very fast.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.000]   They get a PDF, but more importantly, they get a button that
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.160]   says pay right now with a credit card, pay power.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.440]   I think there's 11 electronic payment services.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.880]   That means your clients--
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.160]   it's not that they don't want to pay you.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.000]   They're just lazy like me.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.800]   And they'll pay them.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.600]   We're going to do it all at once.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.200]   See, if they hit the button, they just go check.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.880]   In fact, you can even set it up to do it automatically.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.800]   Invoice and pay.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.760]   So then there's completely friction free.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.880]   Your accountant will love the professional organization
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.520]   around tax time.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.920]   It's all done for you.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.880]   Automated late payment reminders.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.240]   You can send printed invoices.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.640]   I had some old school clients that wanted printed invoices.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.400]   No problem.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.920]   Fresh books will stamp and mail them to your clients,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.800]   complete with a return envelope.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.960]   And you pay extra for that, but that's worth it, believe me,
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.760]   for those clients.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:50.400]   And all of this, free for the first 30 days, how about that?
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   I want you to go to freshbooks.com and try it today.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.240]   Freshbooks.com, 30 days of unlimited use, every feature,

[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.640]   If they ask, if they don't, don't worry about it.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.880]   Freshbooks.com, making online invoicing easy,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.000]   taking your small business, making it a big business.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.120]   I did my homework by the way.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.120]   What?
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.000]   I listened to this American life.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.200]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.600]   That is like easy homework, too.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.440]   It's easy homework, too.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.200]   It's a great show.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.360]   Oh, I completely forgot.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.200]   This American life, by the way, is--
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.760]   there's a lot of good shows sitting all over.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.160]   Not last week, but the week before they had Mike Daisy, who
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.400]   was a friend and a great monologist.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.160]   He does a one-man show.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.400]   His most recently, he's an Apple Self-Confessed Apple
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:36.840]   fanboy.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.440]   His most recent show was about Steve Jobs.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.000]   Good and bad.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.760]   Somebody sent him pictures of the workers.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.280]   No, no, no.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.120]   He found it on the phone.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.640]   Oh, he found it on the phone.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.840]   They had taken pictures on his phone.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.600]   It was either him or somebody else had shown in these pictures
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.320]   that they basically had an iPhone that someone
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.000]   had left.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.200]   There were a handful of pictures that they had just--
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.280]   it was just test photos.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.200]   They were just testing to make sure the camera worked.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.560]   But he saw little bits of inside the--
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.760]   I think the Foxconn or whatever.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.280]   Yeah, Foxconn.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.080]   --the factory there were finishing it.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.280]   And he just kept on thinking about it.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.920]   And so then he went over and did a little research.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.760]   And it was--
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.400]   All right, so this is what I want to know.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.760]   I almost say before, before we get into the details of it,
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.240]   as a listening experience--
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.400]   It's great.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.320]   --as always this American life is a radio show in the world.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   But as a listening experience, this monologue--
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.840]   I mean, he does this so well.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.600]   It's just so enjoyable to watch and to listen to.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.080]   Well, you should be.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.000]   He performs all over the country.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.760]   He says Seattle-based, but he performs all over the country.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.800]   He's really-- if you ever get a chance to see Mike Daisy,
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   do he's hysterical.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.200]   So it's worth listening to matter.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.240]   What you think about all this stuff, just listen to it.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.480]   Well, that's what I like about this.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.680]   So this American life, not only-- then they did the dialogue.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.800]   But then they came back and they had their reporters
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.400]   go and investigate and validate the claims.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.680]   So can you bottom line it?
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.080]   For those of us who didn't listen?
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   Sorry.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.560]   Working conditions are pretty rough.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.360]   You talk about Cengin, which is the--
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.360]   it was, I guess, rice patties 30 years ago, whatever.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.440]   That's 13 million people.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.560]   You're 13 million.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.480]   That no one knows about.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.360]   And that's where basically everything
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.560]   on this table is made.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.880]   And the conditions are--
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.800]   they're very long hours.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.400]   People are working in very oftentimes pretty rough conditions.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.280]   And I think that this comes--
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.880]   I want to say that I found it specifically interesting.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.200]   One of my first jobs out of high school was assembling
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.400]   electronics components.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.520]   So I'm very familiar.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   And it was long hours.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.360]   And we worked in-- I don't think probably nearly as bad
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.960]   a condition as he's talking about here.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.880]   But it was still-- that process is dirty.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.520]   13 year old?
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.080]   And it's messy.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.600]   In there?
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.000]   Young kids.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.600]   Now, I should point out, Apple takes all the heat for this.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.280]   Everybody.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.880]   But everybody uses this Foxconn.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.920]   Kindles are made there.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.840]   I mean, any consumer electronics device you buy
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.560]   is made in almost every case in China, if not at Foxconn.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.480]   But it is similar.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.600]   And in the city.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.240]   I mean, Shenzhen.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   So it's the-- I mean, this is where it really--
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:57.960]   it all happens.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.400]   Now, to Apple's credit, they've joined the Fair Labor
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.920]   Association, the FLA.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.800]   This organization's been around for 12 years.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.200]   It was started by Bill Clinton, Nike, in response to all
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.800]   the heat it's been taking for its workers, Nestle,
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.560]   who are also members.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.960]   Apple has, for the first time ever in response, not only joined
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.600]   this, but listed its suppliers--
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.440]   Hasn't listed where the suppliers are.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.800]   It just listed the names.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.300]   Cool.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.560]   You know, it's like, here they are.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.000]   Well, I think this gives--
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.760]   this gives-- yeah, because Google is a reporter a chance
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.880]   to go out and dig.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.000]   And Apple's credit-- I mean, look at-- Amazon hasn't done this.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.160]   A lot of companies that use these factories has not done this.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.800]   So Friday, they listed all their suppliers.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.480]   They also had a report detailing troubling practices
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.840]   inside many of the giant suppliers.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.680]   Audits, for instance, revealed that 93 supplier facilities
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.600]   had records indicating over the half the workers exceeded
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.000]   a 60-hour work week.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   108 facilities did not pay proper overtime
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.960]   as required by law.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.080]   This is from the New York Times.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.280]   Overtime is required by law in China.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:14.720]   Whose law?
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.280]   I don't know.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.280]   Yeah, those countries.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:16.840]   And 15 facilities.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.600]   Apple found foreign contract workers
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.880]   who had paid excessive recruitment fees.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.760]   This is very common.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.360]   In other countries, I know in Dubai,
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.800]   they'll recruit people from India and China
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.560]   to come to Dubai to build.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.200]   They'll pay a big recruitment fee when they get there.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.040]   Their passports are removed.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.600]   And they, in effect, are indentured servants.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.120]   Which are not claiming that that--
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.520]   Too much of that.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.800]   But 15 facilities.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.120]   Apple has said it mandated changes
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:45.880]   at those suppliers.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.920]   Some show improvements.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.760]   Many types of lapses remained at general levels
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.000]   that have persisted for years.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.160]   So this is the first time Apple has done this.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.920]   They've been, for a long time, labor rights groups
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.880]   have been asking that they do this.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.800]   Apple has resisted citing the firm's culture of secrecy.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.320]   Right.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.480]   So far as not--
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.520]   Well, of them not telling anybody about where--
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.600]   Because if you know who supplies and who makes stuff for Apple,
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.920]   you can do, then you can find out what Apple's doing.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.680]   Exactly.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.000]   I think they've been trying to keep people away from knowing--
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.600]   this is where all those leaks come with,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.400]   where you see parts of components for the next iPad
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.920]   or the next iPhone.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.040]   And I think that they just didn't want the press.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.520]   You know about what's going on there.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.360]   I think that that's the--
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.880]   And I think that one of the challenges for Apple,
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.240]   I think, is that many of the other electronics
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.360]   that we buy, we know that the margins are
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.360]   raised within.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.560]   We know that these companies are working sometimes
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.800]   in operational margins of single percentage points.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.360]   I think that the challenge that Apple has,
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.840]   because the common thing as well,
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.120]   if we improved all the conditions,
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.760]   all of our electronics would cost more,
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.560]   the problem that Apple has is we all know that they're working
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.720]   on a pretty big margin.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.280]   I mean, most of their equipment is running at it.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.920]   They are selling it at a--
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.720]   And they have a little bit of money in the bank.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.440]   I don't know what the last check was, but it was--
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.760]   A few billion here and there.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.800]   A few billion here and there.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.120]   So I think $87.9 billion as of last quarter,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.080]   probably $90 billion when they do the next quarter,
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.120]   next tomorrow or next week.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.960]   The issue is that they're making money handover fist,
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.560]   if they-- the question is, could they
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.800]   improve, vastly improve, the quality of all these lives
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:27.200]   by cutting that margin on their iPhone by $5 or $10 per unit?
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.040]   Would that make a sizable difference?
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.600]   I think that's the challenge that Apple has
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.000]   that other electronics companies don't have,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.520]   and why they stick out is because their margins are so much
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.000]   larger than mostly electronics in the industry.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.920]   And Steve Jobs famously telling President Obama
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.440]   at that dinner in Silicon Valley,
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.200]   hey, the big problem in this country
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.720]   is that it's so hard to build a factory.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.480]   There's so many regulations.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.840]   I mean, it's clear that they like this minimal regulatory
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.320]   environment.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.160]   In China, it makes stuff cheap.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.520]   Right.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.760]   Andy?
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.960]   I was just going to say, I was talking to somebody
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.600]   trying to get more insight about it.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.240]   This is a person who is a consultant to companies
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.040]   about labor relations.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.800]   And he was trying to explain to me
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.520]   that there's very little upside to voluntary disclosure
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.400]   of this type because there's no way
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.720]   to give an adequate answer to the treatment of workers,
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.360]   even if Apple were to build plants
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.880]   to completely domestically source
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.000]   every single manufacturing part of these devices.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.320]   You really can't pay them enough to let it
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.480]   to for an outsider to believe that, yes, I
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.960]   believe these workers are being treated fairly,
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.880]   especially when you're talking about the sort of production
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   that Apple does, where they have to come up with millions
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.960]   and millions and millions of these copies of these devices
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.680]   under fairly short work, short schedule.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:55.160]   So the state of labor around this world
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.720]   is pretty deplorable.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.240]   It's just less deplorable in the United States
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.880]   than it is in China.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   Right.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.720]   And maybe Apple with its vast clout
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:13.720]   and let's hope its conscience can improve things.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.760]   Tim Cook said Apple has used--
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.840]   he wrote an email to Apple employees
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.400]   in which he said Apple has used its influence
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.040]   to improve living conditions for the people who make its products.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.280]   He says, to meet our requirements,
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.680]   many suppliers have renovated their dorms
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.960]   or built new ones altogether.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.600]   This is a little bit like the I'm going
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.920]   to work within the system thing.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.240]   But I have to say, given that there's
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.120]   no way Apple's going to move all of its manufacture to the US,
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.440]   I would love to know.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.760]   I would love somebody like I fix it to do a guess, at least,
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.080]   of what it would cost if an iPhone were built in the US
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.920]   instead of China.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.720]   Right.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:55.320]   When I talked to Ford at CES, one of the things
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.560]   Alan Malawi, the CEO, is very proud of
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.360]   is that their small car manufacturer, much of it
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.080]   had moved back to the US.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.600]   He said it was not economical to build small cars in the US.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.120]   We moved that offshore.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.760]   And we've moved a lot of that back.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.520]   And the other thing to know for people to think about also
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.160]   is that as you improve these living conditions,
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.920]   a lot of reason that we use human labor
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.880]   is because they are cheaper than the machines.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.400]   I was in a--
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.120]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.120]   So when I worked in this electronics fabrication company,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.480]   we built stuff for mine safety and stuff
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.320]   like that.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:34.200]   And the minimum wage went from $325 to $375 an hour.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.120]   I mean, this is way back in the day, 80s.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.520]   And 30 people were laid off.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.920]   Just that minimum wage jumped from $0.50.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.240]   What happened was, is it's very complicated.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.560]   Well, someone looked at it and just said, now,
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.320]   the machine that we've been avoiding buying
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.080]   is now cheaper over the next two years.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.920]   We just buy this machine.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.840]   So they bought this machine and let go of everybody else.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.440]   That was the switch.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.560]   And so we all got paid more, but 30 people
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.760]   weren't no longer there.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.200]   I mean, that's one--
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:31:59.760]   Sorry, Leah.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.960]   One of the things I confused me about--
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.680]   because I did listen to at least the first 40 minutes
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.120]   of that show.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.000]   I'm still sort of went away through it.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.040]   Well, two things really.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.040]   One, there was discussions about how the companies actually
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.000]   shield the suppliers away from the true picture.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.520]   And I think that's quite difficult for Apple
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.320]   to go in and actually see what the real picture is.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.160]   Even no matter how much influence they have,
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.480]   the guy was saying the stories of when
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.600]   the external people are coming in and not necessarily
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.400]   Apple, but just external customers
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.440]   coming in, they would actually clear the lines of the young
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.440]   people and put the old people on and hide things from them.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.480]   So there's that aspect of it.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.080]   But also, I was quite surprised how much emphasis was made.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.600]   As Alex says, how much is actually done by hand?
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.080]   Because whilst I can appreciate that the cost of a labor
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.480]   is negligible in China because of the way things work.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.000]   But on these devices, they're so tiny.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.160]   I really would have thought there
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.400]   would have been a higher level of automation
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.000]   to actually make these products.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.480]   But basically, the report was saying, well,
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.200]   they're literally handmade, which I found a little bit
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.680]   strange because of the scale of the devices
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.680]   and how intricate they are.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.360]   Typically, there's an assembly process
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.680]   that you have most of the surface mount stuff as a machine.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.880]   So you program the machine, as I said,
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.320]   I have a little bit of experience in this area.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.680]   So you program the machine, and then the boards pop out,
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.000]   and the machine does it really fast.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.920]   Just picks them up and sticks them into place,
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.640]   and it actually does a surface solder.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.360]   It goes through this little thing that heats it up.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.720]   So that all goes through.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.680]   But to assemble the parts, to put all these pieces in
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.920]   and pop them in and pop them together and all those things
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.880]   that can't-- that stuff is much more complicated.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.640]   But if you look at where the car manufacturing--
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.400]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.640]   You walk into these big car manufacturing now,
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.360]   and you think there's going to be hundreds of people,
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.920]   and there's robots.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.080]   And that's why they can move it back to the United States,
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.640]   is not because they're hiring lots and lots of people.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.080]   It's automated.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.880]   And I think in this century, I think
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:48.320]   that the issue that we have now is that job danger is
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.320]   made without human hands entirely.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.720]   I mean, in Lexus Plant in Japan, job stability
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.560]   is, I think, going to--
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.880]   machines are more of a danger than overseas at this point.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.200]   Let me also ask the question.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.400]   I think it would make a big difference if these workers
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.760]   were coerced or forced or tricked into working there.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.360]   But if they're voluntarily working there,
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.040]   even if they're making $110 a month, that says something.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:12.720]   That means that--
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.120]   Because a lot more than everybody else.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.800]   Well, that's exactly-- it might mean that this job that we
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   would turn our nose up at is a desirable job considering
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.720]   the economics of China.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.280]   Now, I do have a--
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.080]   It doesn't--
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.040]   It's still not an excuse not to pay that fair wage.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.640]   I agree.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.720]   Now, how much-- OK, we asked, how much more
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.960]   would you think it would cost to make it in America?
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:39.040]   Harvard Business Review has an article by Umer Hock, who
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.920]   quotes the Sloan Foundation.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.160]   They estimate that it's about-- it'd
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.320]   be 20% to 30% more to buy an iPod or an iPhone
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.520]   if we're made in the US.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.720]   That would be roughly, for an iPod classic, $58 more.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:58.040]   Not a huge-- not the jump-- not double, not triple, 20% to 30%
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.520]   more.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.880]   And I'll say as a consumer, I'm probably not the same.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.800]   I'm not the right person.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.400]   But if I knew that it was being made by--
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.760]   with those fair wages or in the United States or whatever,
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.640]   I pay an extra $55.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.880]   So that's one question.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.960]   It's not as-- this surprises me.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.720]   And thank you for the chat for recommending this article.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.600]   It isn't maybe-- now, it's from 2009,
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.640]   but I don't think it's probably any different today.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.480]   It isn't that much more expensive.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:31.240]   An evil iPod classic costs $249 a good iPod classic, $307.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:31.960]   I love this.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.200]   The evil iPod Touch, $229.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.480]   The good iPod Touch, $287.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.680]   It's evil?
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.360]   Really?
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.160]   Well, so there's-- it's so complicated.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   I would probably prefer to spend a little bit more.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.200]   I mean, there are--
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.280]   American apparel only makes this stuff in the US.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.320]   I think there are places where you can go to get American-made
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.320]   goods.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.040]   I think Apple could conceivably offer this as a--
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.760]   I mean, maybe they should be doing this.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.400]   It certainly would help our economy as a--
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.640]   As a bill to order?
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.760]   Well, I think that the--
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.440]   Yeah, maybe as a bill to order, press the button,
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.280]   buy American.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.360]   The complexity of things being done overseas, though,
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.360]   is also dealing with our tax laws
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.960]   because there's an enormous amount of money
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.720]   that Apple has overseas.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.520]   And most of these corporations have overseas
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.720]   because our corporate taxes are a little higher
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.880]   than a lot of other countries.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.920]   And so they keep their money overseas.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.160]   So doing it overseas isn't just about the cost of the goods.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.320]   It's also about where that money is and where they can keep it.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.040]   Well, think about this.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.120]   Don't take it overseas.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.280]   Maybe instead of the 20% to 30% increase,
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.240]   increase the prices 15% and pay the workers in China better.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.120]   What about that?
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.600]   I think that would make sense.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.560]   And I bet you that having these--
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.400]   They're making so many of these iPhones.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.120]   I think that you're really looking at a difference of $4 or $5.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.920]   And not only is it 15%, I think it's 5%.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.880]   Would suddenly change.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.520]   That's an incredible amount of money
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:57.000]   that could be spent on worker environmental improvements.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.120]   Also, Apple's in a position that other manufacturers aren't
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:00.760]   into.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.600]   They make the only hardware that can run the operating systems
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.480]   that their customers actually want to use.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:10.480]   And for an Android phone, a different potential of $10 per unit
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.920]   is just astronomical because it'll
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.800]   send so many of your customers to another phone that's almost
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.480]   exactly the same and runs the same software.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.560]   I don't think there are very many people, myself included,
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:27.280]   who would go for a fair trade Android tablet as opposed
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.760]   to an iPad, which does what I needed to do much, much, much,
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.720]   much better than any Android device.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:39.440]   So if Apple decided to say, during the unveil of the iPad 3
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.680]   or the next iPhone, if they said we are increasing,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.760]   traditionally these things cost $199, $299, $399,
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   we are increasing our prices by 10%.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.360]   But here is what we are buying for that extra 10%.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.800]   We are buying extra workships.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.280]   We are buying better screening of hiring practices.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.640]   We are buying more on-site monitors
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.440]   so that it's not just, oh, quick, hide the little kids
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.680]   because the inspector is coming.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.200]   We'll have better oversight.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.760]   We think that our customers who appreciate not only the way
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.800]   that our device is functioning, the way they look,
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.080]   we also think they appreciate the way that the workers are
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:14.680]   treated.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.600]   I think everybody would fall on that.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.880]   That would be great marketing.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.760]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.440]   And I think that Apple is one of the few companies
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.800]   that could do it because, again, they have some marching
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.600]   to give up.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.360]   And they also have--
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.080]   They can afford it.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.360]   And they have the kind of people who buy a Mac or an iPhone
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.560]   or an iPad are oftentimes not the ones that are looking
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.520]   for the cheapest version of whatever they can get.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.520]   And so they can afford to bump it up a little bit
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.920]   and turn it into a marketing process.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.840]   I think it could be kind of--
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.320]   Well, let's encourage Apple to do that.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:43.960]   Put up--
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.960]   Do a build order.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.800]   It is important.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.680]   One thing I will say is that they got into the FAIR,
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.920]   this FAIR FLN, the FAIR label--
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.680]   Or is it a really glad FAIR label association?
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.240]   And here's what's important about that
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.040]   is that this is the issue is that Apple by itself doing
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.080]   whatever they want to do will have very little impact.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   Because the percentage of electronics built in the world
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.880]   are built out of this area.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.960]   They are 1%, 2%, 3% of all of the electronics
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.400]   built in that area in China.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.000]   So without them backing this up and getting all the manufacturers
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.720]   together, nothing's going to happen.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.720]   They could say all they want about FAIR labor.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.680]   But Foxconn and Apple is not their only--
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.720]   We have this thing like Fox and people committing suicide
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.200]   in Foxconn.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.840]   I don't think Apple is their only client.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.880]   They're making a lot of things for a lot of people.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.400]   And so the thing is that Apple, just putting the brakes on,
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.440]   is not necessarily going to have the same leverage
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.240]   as empowering FLA to get pool everybody, to get Apple,
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.560]   joining FLA.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.600]   And doing this is a great encouragement, a leadership
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.680]   position to bring other people, other companies
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.720]   into that and get everyone playing by the same area.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.200]   And it's interesting--
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.840]   I think that what's interesting-- we're seeing this.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.680]   One of our other clients is the International Seafood
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   Sustainability Foundation.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.040]   And what's interesting is to watch industry trying
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.960]   to find a way to get--
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.400]   whether it's tuna or electronics or everything else.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.840]   You have the industry actually trying to get regulated.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.520]   They're trying to get together and fix the problems
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.000]   that they have because they can't get the government
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.360]   to do it for them.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.320]   And it's a very inverted thing in some of these supply areas
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.120]   because the supplies are so fragmented
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.720]   and there's so many different players
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.400]   that you have to get everybody together.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.200]   And it's almost impossible right now to make that happen.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.640]   And so I definitely applaud Apple for joining the FLA
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.520]   and starting to push this down the pipe.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.640]   Meanwhile, in some sort of weird irony,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.560]   Apple's closed its five Apple stores in China.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.200]   Oh my gosh.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.800]   Because there's such demand in China for these phones,
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.360]   which are made in China, shipped to California,
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.120]   then shipped to-- I don't know.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.640]   Maybe they don't make a trip back.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.720]   $800 I heard is what it costs in China to buy one.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.160]   Now remember, the Fox County employees
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.920]   are getting $110 a month.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.000]   So what's apparently been happening in China,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.960]   some huge percentage of Apple's goods
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.720]   are sold by those five stores.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.560]   There are five Apple stores in China.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:59.240]   What's been happening in China is that the plutocrats,
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.240]   or whoever it is that is buying these phones,
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.720]   hire workers from the country.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.080]   They bust them in to get in line for them.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.120]   And they pay them 15 Renmin Bao, the Chinese currency,
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:15.160]   15 RMBs, if they stay in line.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.520]   If they don't get the phone, they only get 10 RMB.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.680]   They only get the food allowance.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.320]   So when Apple closed its doors and the guy with the megaphone
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.480]   comes out of the Apple store saying, sorry,
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.520]   we're not going to sell iPhones, this is what happens.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.920]   I guess these workers brought eggs.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.680]   Maybe that was their lunch.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.240]   And they're 1,000 of your eggs too.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.680]   Yeah, you didn't.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.040]   Look at the crowd.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.880]   This is the Beijing Apple store.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.360]   And just rioting.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.120]   Oh, maybe rioting.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.560]   And they're grunting.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.560]   Yes.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.720]   Grunting, grumbling, grumbling, grumbling, grumbling.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.120]   They're grunting.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.080]   That's a large crowd.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.280]   And so somebody's buying these iPhones in China.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   I think it just shows that the disparity of income
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.560]   is everywhere, isn't it?
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.680]   Well, yeah, I mean, I know that when they opened--
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.960]   when they started selling cell phones in DRC, the Congo,
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.560]   they thought, oh, it'll be a slow ramp up.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.560]   They sold 60,000 phones in the first week.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   I mean, it's there.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.440]   Is it a status item?
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.440]   Is that one?
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.440]   Oh, it's a huge-- and that's just general phones.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.320]   The thing is, Apple all over the world, everywhere I travel,
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.440]   outside of the United States.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.800]   I think in the United States, in a lot of ways,
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.680]   it's just like kind of everyone has one now.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.720]   But around the world, when especially
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.600]   when you go into the emerging world,
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.680]   having a nobody has max and nobody has iPhones.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.280]   And so especially an iPhone or an iPad,
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.440]   I could have paid for my trip to Africa every single time
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.800]   if I had just taken 10 iPads or 10 iPhones
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.280]   and just thrown them in my bag and brought them in,
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.640]   because they'll pay me two or three times what I paid for them.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.200]   Now ironically, you could still buy these iPhones online
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.600]   and through a unicorn, which is a Chinese--
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.480]   They didn't want you to come into the store anymore.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.680]   It's just too dangerous.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.880]   Bad for PR.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.840]   That's what it was.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.120]   It's big crowds.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:07.760]   So it's official.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.400]   The iPhone is the OxyContin of personal electronics.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.360]   It's too much hassle.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.120]   Security actually stuck them in the store.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.040]   Right.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.520]   Right.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.320]   Yeah, the gray market value in Hong Kong,
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.040]   this is in October before this happened,
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.960]   was $1,350.
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.240]   So roughly twice the price of the US price.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.840]   And people were buying as many as--
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:31.200]   Actually, it was $100 R&B, which is like a month's pay
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.720]   for $16 for getting in line for that phone.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.880]   So that's a lot of money.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.800]   It's set, couldn't you?
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   Because if--
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.600]   Because they're not getting the phone,
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.400]   it's that fee that they're not going to make them upset.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.160]   Yeah, these guys aren't going to get the phone.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.560]   They're standing in line for others.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.000]   Wow.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.160]   And we thought the man was high here.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   Same thing happened last year with the iPad, too.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:55.800]   And it'd be like--
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.720]   I mean, to put it in perspective,
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.720]   it'd be like someone's saying, I'll pay you $1,000
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.560]   in the United States.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.200]   I'll pay you $1,000 to stand in line.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.920]   And then you get to the line, and then they shut it down.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.280]   That's my phone.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:03.800]   I'd be pissed.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.240]   And you've been waiting for all night,
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.200]   and this is going to be your monthly, whatever.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.880]   And you'd be throwing stuff around.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.440]   I mean, that's the issue.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:16.560]   Apple is almost 25% of the--
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.000]   Look at this.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.840]   So someone else--
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.660]   There's some other math done, I think, by ours,
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.680]   Technica, or someone else that noted
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.440]   that that graph wasn't completely accurate.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.320]   Oh, so--
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.600]   This is from Deutsche Bank.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.080]   Yeah, there's another one that they--
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.200]   They think that they combined it.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:28.880]   There's the second one.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.480]   Ah.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.240]   That graph is more accurate.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.120]   Apple outsider ran the numbers
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.840]   and got 15% Apple market share with iPads added in.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.560]   Hey, that's still fine.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.600]   I still would be happy.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.360]   Oops, too big.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.240]   So Apple is the light blue.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.720]   This is simmering along under 5%
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.600]   until first quarter 2010, then--
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.000]   Woo, woo!
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.680]   Here they call that.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.640]   They call that--
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.000]   They call it--
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.440]   Steve's Revenge.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.360]   Steve's Revenge.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.560]   Steve's Revenge.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.800]   In fact, they're right up there with HP.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.680]   How come HP's still up on top?
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.600]   Because I thought they gave away the PC business.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:03.960]   Oh, right.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.960]   They got out of that guy.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.400]   They apparently did hurt their sales.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.720]   HP's sales considerably this year.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.200]   The apothequer effect.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.960]   It's going to be called from now on.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.120]   And that's your getting out of the business, then don't.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.560]   Yeah, that's not a good bad.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:19.040]   I think like 18% of sales down.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.360]   Jeez, stupid.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.040]   Stupid, stupid.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.120]   Acer tumbling.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.960]   Dell tumbling.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:28.080]   The only other strong one is the Chinese Lenovo.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.240]   And the other thing that I thought
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.920]   was interesting is that in another article--
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.480]   and I can't remember where I saw it--
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.560]   they said that business sales and business workers now,
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.480]   up to 12% of them are only using iPads.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.280]   And that's the thing is that when we say it's
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.000]   a stretch to call an iPad at computer, a lot of these folks
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.800]   are moving away.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.920]   They don't need--
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.400]   and I work with a lot of business clients.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.680]   And you're seeing more and more of them
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.720]   just show up with their iPads.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.320]   They don't want to deal with their laptop.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.640]   Is it fair to bundle the iPad with PC's with--
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.120]   I think it's all computers.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.000]   When you look at what an average business user is using it for,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.200]   they're using it for their--
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.720]   they're running their email.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.800]   They're running their web browser.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   They're running probably usually some kind of management
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.640]   system, so like a sales force or whatever, when they're--
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.760]   that type of interface.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.320]   And those aren't interfaces are all built for the iPad now.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.000]   So when you look at what they're doing with it
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.200]   on a day-to-day basis, especially when they're
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.040]   out in the field, they just don't need it.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.760]   And I think that it is a replacement, not for everybody,
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.320]   but for many people from a notebook.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.640]   Yeah, I got a shock this week.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.200]   My brother-in-law, he's died in the world Windows guy.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.840]   And he's always used Windows laptops and PCs.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.080]   And it turned up the house yesterday with an iPad.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.440]   He had the choice of a new notebook or an iPad.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.160]   And he went for the iPad.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.920]   So of course, that's the support for support now.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.560]   But I was really shocked, to be honest,
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.520]   because he just came from that field.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.880]   I just didn't stand--
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.720]   I'd not really been coaching him about it,
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.640]   but he'd been hearing about the iPad
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.840]   and understood it could do all the things that he wanted to do.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.760]   And it was cheaper than buying a new notebook.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.520]   So he decided to plump for the iPad.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.320]   I'm really curious to skim my hands on.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.720]   ASOS has their new transformer prime tablet, which is--
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.080]   the bad news is that it's an Android tablet.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.600]   But the good news is that it's quad core, like latest CPU.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.400]   The big deal is that you've seen these keyboard cases
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.320]   for the iPad that does kind of a really lame sort of an insert
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.240]   so that it will kind of look like a laptop.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.040]   It'll have a keyboard, but it's not big enough
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.600]   to really treat it like a real keyboard.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.640]   But hey, it'll look like a laptop.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.440]   The transformer, when you put it all in,
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.920]   all said and done, you get nearly a full-size keyboard,
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.440]   plus a battery that actually powers the slate
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.880]   so that you'll get 18 hours worth of life, plus a trackpad,
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.840]   plus it really does make it into, as the name implies,
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.560]   a transformer.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.480]   You can get undocked as a tablet,
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.960]   or actually have it as a syringe notebook machine.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.080]   So I think--
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.720]   I wonder what-- I've played with the predecessor to this.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.360]   It was pretty damn impressive.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.640]   It is pretty damn good.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.840]   I think they really did a good job building it.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.560]   And I wonder if Apple's going to look at graphs like that one,
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.800]   and also look at how well devices like the ASOS
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.680]   actually perform in the field, and decide maybe it's time
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.000]   for us to revisit the idea of a keyboard doc,
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.840]   given that the first one was such a load of Donkeys kidneys.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.000]   And maybe we should do something that's more formally
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.880]   for people who really do want to use their iPad
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:23.520]   as their one traveling machine.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.880]   Yeah, I've tried to use some of those cases
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.960]   with the Bluetooth keyboard that's a case.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.320]   And yeah, they're not--
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.680]   Can't write a type on that.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.760]   The only possible solution that I found
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.640]   is standard Apple Bluetooth modelless keyboard,
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.680]   the in case origami case for that keyboard,
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.400]   which not only will protect the case when you've got in your bag,
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:44.520]   but also unfolds into a nice easel that holds the iPad perfectly.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:48.080]   I've yet to see a single iPad keyboard case
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.640]   that you can type on with more than one finger--
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.920]   more than two fingers for more than like 23 minutes.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.640]   It's just no good.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.960]   Yeah, plus it's quad core tegra.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.440]   That tegra three is-- it's a Holland mother.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.360]   You can't deny that it's one Holland mother.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.320]   It's beautiful, too.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.680]   I mean, this is rushed metal.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.960]   I mean, it's just gorgeous.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.560]   Yeah, I'm really curious to see what 2013 happens.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.240]   I think that for Google to ever really compete with the iPad,
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.120]   they have got to get their stuff together to a degree
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.160]   with which they have never demonstrated their ability
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.120]   to get their stuff together before.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:25.040]   But if they can start putting out half decent tablet apps,
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.120]   that could really be a problem for Apple and the iPad.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.320]   Because people don't have the same sort of immersive attachment
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.920]   to an iPad that they would have to their notebook.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:39.160]   I mean, if my MacBook were to be 20% not as good as any alternative,
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.160]   that's a huge, huge problem for me.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.920]   That probably caused me to switch to some other operating system.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:48.120]   But if there were something that were 80% as good as the iPad
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.120]   but were 150% better at simply being a really lightweight
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.760]   mobile computer, that would be awfully tempting.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.040]   Yeah, because you still get the tablet.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:57.840]   You're right, though.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.760]   They're way behind both on operating system and apps.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.480]   I'm just not, I'm a little underwhelmed with ice cream sandwich.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.600]   It's improvement, but it's not enough of an improvement.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.320]   It's really threatened the iPad.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.000]   Yeah, I've been working on my ice cream sandwich review
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.320]   because I keep having to tone it down a little bit more
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.560]   because the first one was about 2,000 words of,
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.680]   "Oh, for the love of God people,
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.760]   you're being paid to write an operating system here.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.040]   What have you been doing with the past two years of your lives?"
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.560]   It does feel like they should hire somebody
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.280]   who's good at user interface.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.040]   They need, yeah, they need, I was looking at,
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.840]   they released their user interface guidelines
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.520]   for the first, the comprehensive user interface guidelines.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.120]   That might make a change.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.680]   Well, that might make a change, but I don't,
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.560]   I think it just documents to the degree to which they don't get it.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.160]   There's one page I was looking at particular
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.920]   because I was just like so many other people
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.560]   were trying to figure what does the back button,
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.600]   that's part of the system deck of buttons
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.160]   at the bottom of the screen, what does that actually supposed to do?
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.680]   And to try to illustrate that, they put a typical,
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:59.120]   like, Android based, a photo album app on one side of the page,
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.840]   on the other side of the page is the seconds,
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.760]   the similar kind of thing that we do for the iPhone.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.320]   And they're trying to demonstrate why their way is better
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.560]   and how their way works.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.320]   And all I can think of is I'm looking at the iPhone screen
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.840]   and I'm seeing a very clear, uncluttered display.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.040]   I know exactly what everything does.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.680]   There is a back button at the top of the screen
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.960]   that I know is attached to the application
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.400]   and not to the operating system.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.360]   Furthermore, at that button is labeled
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.000]   so I know exactly where I'm going to go if I tap that button.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.400]   On the Android side, I've got at least two back buttons.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.360]   One of them looks like it was just like the left carrot symbol.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.480]   It doesn't look like it's an actual active button.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.160]   The bottom one looks like it could be a refresh button.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.360]   It looks like it could be a back button.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.880]   It could be a system back to the previous application I used button.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.160]   I really am starting to think that it's not
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.840]   that Android is a complete disaster,
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.520]   but they've entered their phase of complexity
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.480]   where for the next edition, they're going to have to kind of start
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.880]   all over again with three people in one conference room
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.560]   for one whole month, going from start to finish,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.000]   throwing up things that don't work
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.360]   and adding new coherence to the OS.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.720]   Because Microsoft is going to surpass them.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.760]   Probably already surpassed them, not in unit volume,
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.360]   but certainly in sophistication for mobile operating systems.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.960]   Yeah, one of those phones is awesome.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.200]   Yeah, and they're just going to get their lunch handed to them.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   Unless Google is comfortable with just being
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.640]   the free operating system that people aren't really aware
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.480]   that they're using and don't really like.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.480]   They just like the fact that they've bought this piece of hardware
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.040]   with whatever operating system on it.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.880]   And they're happy with that, all part two of them.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:33.320]   But if they actually want to be a force in operating systems
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   and mobile, then this is not the operating system
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.080]   that's going to give it to them.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.760]   You and I disagree a little bit on that.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.440]   I mean, I'll actually use Android and love it.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:44.480]   And I like, I miss not having a back button on the iPhone.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.560]   I agree that the behavior is somewhat inconsistent,
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.840]   but it's consistent enough to me that it's really handy.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.600]   I use it constantly.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:56.200]   It just bothers me that there's sometimes I'll be looking at a screen
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.520]   that has what appear to be three different back buttons on it
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.240]   at the same time.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.280]   Well, that's a problem more in ice cream sandwich
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.760]   than it is in previous versions, which had hardware buttons.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.320]   And I have to say, I think that they made a mistake on that.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.120]   I've said that before, because buttons that move around
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.720]   and are unpredictable are not good user interface design.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.320]   I have to think they did it not for UI purposes,
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.120]   but to make these phones less expensive.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.560]   And that's just not a good reason to get rid of buttons.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.640]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:28.240]   I mean, you start looking back at how brilliant so many
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.120]   of the small touches on the iPhone are.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.640]   The idea that there is exactly one physical software
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.240]   button on there, one that will actually
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.640]   interact with the operating system directly,
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.200]   as opposed to just volume and mute and stuff like that.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.560]   There's only one button like that.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.520]   And it's instinctively, after your first hour of using the iPhone,
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.160]   you know that any time that I want to go back to home base
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.640]   or anything that I want to do something that
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.200]   affects the device itself, the root level operating system,
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.000]   as opposed to the application that I'm in right now,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.280]   it's this one mechanical button and nothing else.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.400]   Yeah, but my problem with that is, yes, that's true.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.560]   It's consistent.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.360]   This is exactly the tradeoff.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.680]   It's consistent, but it often does what I don't want to do,
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.880]   which is pull me out of the app, then I have to go back in the app.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.280]   Whereas what I really wanted to do was go to the previous page of that.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.680]   You know, I find myself naturally, like I want to go to something like I'm into something
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.880]   that I want to back up.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.120]   And I naturally just jump out of the app.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.120]   Like I'm like, I want to go out.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   That's your only choice.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   Right.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.880]   And we have that, you know, Android has that.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.880]   They have a home button.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:29.320]   But I think having a back button, I think Google should pay more attention to making
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.200]   the back behavior more consistent and more predictable.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   But I have to say, I love the back button and when I don't have it, I miss it.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.560]   But anyway, I don't want to go on and on because you and I have had this conversation
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.840]   a million times.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   I agree with you.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.120]   Ice cream sandwich is a bit of a disappointment and a bit of a mishmosh and they do need to
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.800]   do a better job.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.120]   But I am going to get that transformer.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.800]   I'm going to buy it because I have a feeling that that's a tablet.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.160]   I will use a lot just for the fact that this guy.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.520]   I'm hoping that Asus says they're going to be sending me one.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:58.200]   I'm actually hoping it arrives in time for me to take it with me to San Francisco.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.200]   That'd be nice.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.600]   They'll be tempting to just travel with the iPad and just the transformer.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   I'll make you deal.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.920]   We'll fly you out a day early so you can bring it to Mac break weekly and all about
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.920]   Android.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   All right.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.760]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.640]   Yes, we will get to the rumors big enough.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.920]   We know that there's a Thursday event, Apple event.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.080]   We'll talk about what they might be talking about and why Alex thinks it's going to be
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.240]   exciting when the rest of us are going.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.240]   Exciting.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.480]   And iPad 3 and iPhone 5 rumors before we do that though.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:32.880]   Let's talk a little bit about my friends at Ford and their new electric vehicles and
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:37.560]   hybrid electric which I call plug-in.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.560]   So Ford has announced the 2012 Ford Focus Electric.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.720]   I've been talking about that for a while.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.600]   I'm on the waiting list.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.960]   That is coming very soon.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.480]   It's 100% electric system.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.760]   And in 2013, they're going to do the C-Max Energy plug-in hybrid.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:56.800]   They've also announced plug-in hybrids on other vehicles in the Ford line.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.640]   I love plug-in hybrid because you still have a gas engine but you can run on electricity
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.360]   only for 15 miles.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:07.760]   So if you're just driving around town, you're all electric.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:12.440]   But when you need to go farther, which I often do, your hybrid kicks in.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.120]   So they say 100 miles to the gallon, I mean it could be a lot more.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:19.560]   It could be a million infinite number miles of the gallon if you only go 15 miles.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.440]   I love the idea of being able to plug-in.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.280]   I know that I can run.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   I like having the back end.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:28.960]   I'm going to do a long trip to LA and I know I can still put gas in it.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.960]   But I love the idea that I could try to live my entire life inside of an electric existence.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.440]   So you get the best of both worlds?
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:39.520]   Here's things that's interesting is that most of the studies show is that 90% of people
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.760]   very rarely, occasionally go over 70 miles in a day.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.320]   So a lot of times, which all electric is sufficient for.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.560]   And as we get more and more electric charging stations, you could go to the...
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.040]   First I go to Oakland Airport, you get prime parking.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.320]   I know you get to plug-in.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.200]   Right now in a lot of places, you get the best parking.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.840]   There's a number one reason to do all electric plug-in or whatever is you get to use the
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.080]   HOV lanes, the high occupancy vehicle lanes.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.240]   And you get to park right in front.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:10.880]   So the 2012 Focus, which is almost out, Ford Focus Electric, no gas engine at all, fully
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.320]   charges in three to four hours when you get that 240 volt.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.120]   It'll charge on your regular plug, but it takes longer.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   Is it 240 or 440?
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.120]   240.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.120]   Okay.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:23.000]   And Leviton makes these and you can get it through the dealer.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.880]   It's actually not a very complicated addition.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.000]   It gives you a special plug that you plug into the car.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.840]   And that'll charge it in three to four hours.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:35.920]   So you can go home, have dinner and be ready to go back out.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.200]   Zero emissions, that's the advantage.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.720]   You know, a hybrid's going to have some emissions.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.920]   This is zero emissions, no CO, no CO2.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.960]   And if I had two cars, I would get one that's purely electric.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.440]   I'd like knowing that I could go on a long trip, but I would get otherwise I'd get one
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.440]   that...
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.040]   Well, I was talking to Ellen, this is one of the reasons they didn't do electric right
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.720]   away is because what they want to do is make every car in the line, they actually figured
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.040]   out a way to make the assembly line 70% of all the cars the same.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.400]   If you're making the fusion, it's 70% is the same.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:07.840]   When you get to the drive train, it's like you could push a button on the same assembly
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.360]   line diesel gasoline.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:13.200]   He calls it petrol because around the world is called petrol.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.680]   It's only here.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.680]   Right.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:22.320]   Hybrid, hybrid electric, electric, all in the same assembly line across all of their
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.760]   product line.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.760]   That's...
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.200]   And the reason they do that is if you're in Iowa, you can't...
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:32.520]   If anything is more than 50 miles away, you need some kind of a gas engine.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.200]   We don't do diesel much here anymore because diesel gas isn't any cheaper.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:40.400]   It's more expensive than regulatory mission standards mean that diesel is not often sold
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:44.000]   here, but in other parts of the world diesel is the way to go.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.560]   So this idea is you make the car based on demand, based on what people need.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.280]   Here's a question for you.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:56.760]   What year do you think it will get to the point where it's hard in California to find
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.240]   a petrol station?
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.240]   That's an interesting question.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.760]   It might not be more than 10 years away.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.240]   If gas prices still go up like they're going, 2025.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   2020, 2025.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.960]   You start going, you know, I remember when it was...
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.960]   You just go anywhere and you could find a petrol station or gas station and they'll
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.240]   be like, now all there is is plugs.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:15.320]   How much a leader is gas in the UK?
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.480]   It's a lot more.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.480]   Because they have a lot of taxes.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.480]   We have a guy from the UK who could actually answer this question.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.840]   It's about 120.9 pay a liter, I think, to my...
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.160]   Yeah, I think about 127, 230 pay.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:28.760]   Okay, I'm going to ask the chat room to convert that to dollars for gallon.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:30.600]   I don't know what to do with that.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.600]   Like $5 a year.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.600]   Like $4.00 per liter.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.440]   Is that about $5 a gallon?
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.560]   And so how much?
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.920]   So somebody in the chat room do some math.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.520]   $8 to $9 a gallon.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.920]   See, when it gets to that point here, you're going to watch a big transformation.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.160]   Get ready because it's going to...
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.640]   I was getting quiet.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:47.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.640]   I mean, I think that...
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:49.960]   I think we're moving towards this.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.680]   And I tell you what, I want an electric vehicle.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.680]   That's why I'm on the waiting...
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.080]   No, the other thing for it's doing is these apps.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:59.000]   So what happens is you've got the charger, you've got the...
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.680]   So let's say you get home, you plug the car in, you have the app on the iPhone that tells
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680]   you the state of the car...
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.680]   It's in the garage.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.280]   It tells you the state of the car, it's state of the charging.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.200]   You can control when you charge.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.600]   So if your utilities, which most do now, or are going to in California, we're about
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.720]   to start doing this, charge a lot more for peak hours and a lot less for off peak hours.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:22.040]   You say, "Don't charge it until this time."
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.480]   You can...
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:31.320]   In the car, the GPS now has fastest, shortest, most eco-friendly, most efficient route, which
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.040]   I love.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.640]   You can even precondition the battery from the smartphone.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.240]   This is where you see sync in my Fort Touch and the app link all start to come together.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240]   You see this?
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.200]   What's going to happen is people are going to see this...
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.760]   Oh, they planned this from the very beginning.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:47.760]   All right.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.160]   Oh, it was a strategy.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.960]   I'm so excited about this.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.320]   Regenerative braking, of course.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.080]   So when you put your foot on the brakes, all that friction doesn't go just to heat.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.560]   It goes to charging the battery.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.280]   The lithium-ion batteries allow topping off without reducing the life of the battery.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   There's the 240 volt.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.520]   Don't you love how it goes circling around like that?
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.400]   You know, it's charging.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.000]   I drove one of these and that's so impressive.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.920]   I want you to take a test drive.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.560]   They'll be out very soon at Ford dealer near you, or visit Ford.com/technology for more
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.200]   information.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.960]   Ford is really truly a 21st century car company.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.440]   They really need to lend me one of those for a week.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.440]   I know, me too.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.920]   All in your mind, one mind comes.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.600]   But I have to say at CES, it was absolutely clear.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.960]   Ford was leading the way in all of this stuff.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:36.960]   Absolutely clear.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   And I think that's so cool.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960]   I just love that.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.960]   All right.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.760]   So Thursday, you're so excited about it.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   Tell us about it.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.760]   Apple.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   So rumors.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.920]   Well, there's an education.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   We know that there is an--
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   They say it out in an invite.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.640]   Publishing/education event happening in New York.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.000]   The invite says that.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   So it's not like--
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   Right, so we know that.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   That's not a rumor.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   The rumor is what are they going to talk about.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.640]   And the rumors that are building-- there's a big, very large apple in the middle.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640]   It's the big apple.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   That really is the thing.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   The apple, I love that.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.200]   At the Guggenheim Museum at 10 AM Eastern times, it's 7 AM here.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.800]   So we'll do breaking news, I guess.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.200]   I guess we'll have to.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200]   Thursday, can we do that?
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.200]   At 10 AM, we can.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.200]   Yeah, it's supposed to be 7 AM.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.200]   No, no, at 7 AM.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.200]   Oh, 7 AM.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.200]   Yeah, I guess we can.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.200]   Eileen Rivera.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.200]   You don't have to get up.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   I'll get up.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.200]   Sure, sure, sure.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.200]   I'll get up.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.200]   Well, you have a long day because that's the-- oh, no, this is Thursday.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.200]   Thursday.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.200]   Yeah, tomorrow when we'll talk about this at the end of the show, we're going to observe
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.160]   the blackout day, the soap of blackout day.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.280]   But we have a unique way of doing that, which you will see tomorrow.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:43.440]   So the rumor is that apple is going to release some kind of publishing system that makes it
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:48.440]   easier to publish to possibly the e-book, the e-pub 3 format, which--
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.680]   They call it the garage band of e-pub.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.600]   Yeah, that's what they're saying that it could be.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.600]   That's the rumor.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.680]   And that's what we've all-- you know, all of us have been talking about since the iPad
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680]   came out as we got.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.120]   It's got to be easier to develop content for the iPad.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.840]   And what is the e-pub 3 standard?
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.840]   How does that-- do you know anything about that?
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:09.320]   What a change-- Apple, the iBook standard right now is a-- you know, it's basically you
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:14.240]   can add stuff using HTML5 to add more interactivity, video, audio.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.000]   So e-pub 3 is supposed to be actually adding a lot of that into the format.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.720]   So you'll be able to have video, you'll be able to have interaction, you'll be able
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   to have audio.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.720]   I'm not sure exactly what else is in there.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.160]   Remember the elements I've had app?
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.160]   Yes.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.360]   So you'll be able to publish that as a book as opposed to a device specific app.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   Exactly.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.640]   So that's perfect.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.160]   So the question is, is that if apple-- the rumor right now is that apple is definitely
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.800]   going to give some kind of publishing tool to the publishers, because right now it's
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.520]   still painful to do that level of interaction, which it seems to authors as well.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.360]   But here's the thing is that's the question though, is are they going to do that?
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.560]   Because it seems odd that they're having all these big publishers who are about to have
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:58.080]   their guts ripped out, showing up with them at the event.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.480]   So I wonder how much democratization apple is going to give us immediately, because--
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.200]   and I hope it's all of it.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.480]   But I just feel like how are these publishers-- how are they not just completely terrified?
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.000]   Maybe they're coming out of terror.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.280]   But how are they not terrified of the fact that this completely cuts the publisher out
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280]   of the-- out of this loop?
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.280]   I'll tell you.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.280]   It becomes easy to publish.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.160]   If you're a web designer studying HTML5 and CSS right now, you're in the catbird seat,
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.240]   because that's the standards that this uses.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.160]   The audio and video are through HTML5's audio and video tags.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:35.080]   CSS is being used-- CSS3 is being used for all the design.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.400]   Another multimedia feature is the inclusion of media overlay documents.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.360]   When prerecorded narration is available for a publication, media overlays provide the
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.080]   ability to synchronize the audio with the text of the document.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.800]   I love that.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.720]   I've always wanted that with my audio books.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.680]   Amazon could do this, wish they would.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:05:01.120]   And hopefully, if it's true that there's going to be a garage band, quote unquote, for ePub,
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:08.400]   to develop for the iPad or for iBooks, it would be if it really is that easy.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.400]   And it could be.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.040]   I mean, you look at pages, you could almost do that right now.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.360]   I mean, pages almost has the tools that you would need, because you could insert movies
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360]   and everything else.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.600]   All you have to do is add a plugin, an export plugin.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.080]   Yeah, and if you look at iWeb, which was a disaster on the web, but--
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.480]   The plugin also supports scripting using HTML5 and SVG.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.720]   Scripting can be disabled if you want security.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.520]   Text to speech will be in there.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.440]   This sounds like a really great format.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:38.440]   Yeah, I mean, so many pieces of this have been sort of converging with each other.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.720]   Pages actually already is a really good ebook builder.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.680]   I believe they had some problems with conformity.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:53.280]   But in terms of going from document to fairly sophisticated format ePub document, there
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.200]   are a bunch of people who use that as the first step of their workflow.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.520]   And they go in back in and they might hack the style sheets a little bit to make it look
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:03.200]   a little bit more like a book and less like a converted document.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   But they've been certainly moving towards this for quite some time.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:16.440]   There are plugins for Automator and that automate a lot of that process as well.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:23.320]   If you want to look at this in one way as a Death Star sort of weapon for the iBook Store,
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.640]   right now the iBook Store is I think is kind of languishing because there's just no compelling
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.720]   reason to go with the iBook Store instead of with the Kindle Store.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:38.320]   If they were to build a product that allows publishers to put stuff in the iBook Store,
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:44.000]   that is sophisticated, elegant, fast, and so that people who own the rights of their own
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.960]   content can quickly turn a edited manuscript into a very professional looking book into
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.320]   the iBook Store and make it marginally more difficult than printing.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:58.000]   Suddenly the iBook Store has lots of content and that's not available on the Kindle Store.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.440]   I think that's really important because I think that one of the issues about that is
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:05.120]   is that the Kindle right now, one of the dangers of it other than the Kindle Fire,
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.360]   but the other Kindles have the danger of holding back digital publishing because they are not
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:13.280]   sophisticated enough to really add the kind of, you know, they're fine, they're books,
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.560]   but it's kind of like they're still in the land of we're going to put movie cameras
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.120]   and shoot people on stages and we're not going to move forward and right now we're
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.360]   kind of stuck in that little world of we're just going to read books on an electronic
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.400]   device where what Apple by creating this publishing, it could give Apple the opportunity
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:35.400]   to really push this down the path and basically, you know, push the older Kindles into obsolescence,
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.720]   which I think that wouldn't necessarily be bad for Amazon.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.960]   I think it would more force Amazon to finally adopt EPUB as their publishing standard.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.080]   Right now their Kindle book format, it uses elements of HTML, it uses things, it uses
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:53.560]   technologies that are standards that are familiar to web developers, but every time the world
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:59.040]   E publishing community comes up with a great new standard like EPUB 3, Apple can be first
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.080]   in line to take advantage of that.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.960]   Whereas Amazon gets closer and closer to that monumental decision where they say that,
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.960]   okay, having our own proprietary format really is not working out for us.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.960]   And if we don't want to have our lunch handed to us, we're just going to have to buy the
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.280]   bullet and upgrade to EPUB 3.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.800]   Yeah, my only concern for Thursday though is the fact that it's, you know, they have
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.000]   publicized it as an education event.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.200]   So I'm sure the tools will come eventually, whether or not they'll arrive on Thursday,
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.200]   I'm not too sure.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.440]   I really envisaged the tool sort of being part of the new wildlife package when that hopefully
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.520]   turns up once they've sorted out their iCloud integration, etc.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.040]   So I think on Thursday, I think the big push is going to be around the textbook industry
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:39.280]   and we all know from the Steve Jobs biography that, you know, that was something that Steve
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280]   was actually working on.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.360]   So I'm sort of getting to bed with the publishers and an education event and being on the, you
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.000]   know, within New York, I don't know.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.280]   I would like to see the tools.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.560]   I'm just a bit suspicious with that.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.360]   We will see them Thursday.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.280]   But of course, well, I could say why you might want to if you were Apple.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:01.080]   First of all, all the kindles but the fire cannot do all these multimedia things.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.240]   The iPad just it beautifully.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.560]   Number one.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:11.520]   Number two, if you are going to redefine textbooks, this is exactly these are the features you
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.200]   would want to build into them.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.960]   So it would make sense for Apple to offer tools for textbook publishers to encourage
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.800]   them to include multimedia and all of this.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.480]   There are other solutions by the way, the e-pods been around for a long time and there
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.800]   are other solutions.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.160]   The question was, will Apple make these tools available to the public?
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.160]   Yeah, that's the question.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.000]   Because then we got a little problem here.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.440]   But even if it's just for textbook publishing, that's a big win for Apple.
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   I agree.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.640]   The answer to every question, why are they getting into this business?
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.320]   The answer to that question for Apple is always to sell more hardware.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.640]   They don't do iTunes to make money off of selling music or apps or anything like that.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.440]   It's because they make the hardware, the high margin stuff much, much more valuable.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.520]   So if they suddenly make the iPad the absolute default computer issue to everyone from third
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.960]   grade all the way into college, they can make a few bucks.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.800]   Well, and the thing is that a lot of these schools are right now having to make a decision
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:14.680]   about the fact a lot of schools have been very slow to adopt real technology progress.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:17.760]   And they are now at a point where they're going to have to make a decision about technology
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:20.920]   and they have a lot of choices and a lot of them are semi-even.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.960]   If you suddenly have this great publishing format and all this content and everything
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.320]   else that's available on the iPad, in some ways to the school, it almost becomes less
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.360]   expensive because you're now not dealing with all those books.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:38.320]   And I think that what we see right after this, but I think that in fact, this is a big problem
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.280]   I have because they're not dropping the prices significantly on textbooks in an electronic
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.440]   format and you are losing the resale value.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.560]   It's actually costing more for these e-textbooks because you cannot resell them.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.800]   It's actually my in every experience I've had both in secondary and upper education
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.480]   is costs more because you don't have a resale.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.520]   And that's a real that these guys have not dropped the prices.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.280]   This is one reason the textbook companies are very happy to get an Apple's lap.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.080]   It's because it gets rid of the use market.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.640]   You get used to the use book market.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.640]   And I think that is the point.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:16.080]   I think that in the long term, this gets into the whole media industry, in the short term
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.080]   it's good for them.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.440]   In the long term, suddenly you have a lot of different ways of people publishing a lot
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.240]   of these pieces and getting full access.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.360]   Whether Apple gives people full access at the beginning may change whether they give
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.360]   them full access down the road.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:35.520]   But I think that Apple has an incredible opportunity right now to corner the education market again
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:40.000]   like they did in the past because suddenly, if I were the textbook companies, I would
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.640]   just look at the recording industry and say short term versus long term.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.600]   You just need to understand what Apple is.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.800]   The key to understand what Apple is.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.800]   Apple plays a very long game.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:53.480]   How long do you want to be in this business?
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.480]   So I think that's going to be a challenge.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:59.240]   Now, as I said at the beginning of the show, we're building this school in Rwanda and
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:04.640]   we threw a long pass where the entire school is built around iPads as the format that we're
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.160]   going to do all the training, which was a little risky until that's why I'm so excited
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.160]   about Thursday.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.160]   It's a little risky.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.480]   I was like, oh, I'm going to have to build a lot of stuff in FileMaker to make this all
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.480]   work.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:17.520]   And it looks like hopefully we'll get access to the tools that we need to kind of help
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.600]   flesh all that stuff out.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.320]   But I think that I think it really puts Apple in driver's position because I think it's
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.040]   going very hard for anyone else to build these after Apple has gotten down that path.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.040]   Right.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.040]   And I think that--
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.040]   Right.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.280]   Which is why the textbook administration think twice before they give Apple a monopoly.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.560]   I mean, the key here is Apple's going to try to get a monopoly.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.400]   Oh, they're going to try to make it so that every student, and right now the iPad, I
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.040]   will say, is the best solution to hand students.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.040]   Right now.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.040]   Right now.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.040]   And if they go down this path--
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.160]   The transformer prime could very well be the best solution because it is a keyboard.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.400]   Now, if it's an open format, if it's an ePub format, ePub 3 format, theoretically, you
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.440]   could do it on a lot of things.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.880]   Although it still will push the hardware because you're still developing all that content in
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880]   some area.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880]   Right.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.240]   I think we'll watch with great interest to see what Apple announces on Thursday.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:12.400]   So anyway, I think that this is a huge-- I mean, I just think that it's really-- it's
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.520]   hard to describe how big it is because it's not just education.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.600]   It may start in education.
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:22.240]   But what we're talking about is a long-term development of it being easy for authors to
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.640]   build interactive.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.200]   The next generation of book, we're moving away.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.000]   We're taking people off the stage.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.520]   We're taking the cameras off the tripods.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:35.880]   We're starting to do things that are really moving the content conversation forward from
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.760]   these old books and where we're going to look back.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:45.240]   This is when-- if this publishing becomes easy, this is where the fork happens, where
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.680]   there's the old-fashioned books that are really just on paper and really only have one way
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:55.320]   to enjoy them to these multimedia experiences that happen to have text in them as well.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.160]   It's very-- it's exciting.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.160]   It's very exciting.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.800]   I think it'll be more exciting if it helps to further decentralize publishing.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.360]   If it just means that independent people everywhere from the person who's got a novel
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:14.360]   in the drawer to the person who has a contract and a successful audience for their writing,
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:19.360]   if this gives them the impetus to simply say, "Why am I bothering with a large publisher
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.680]   and settling for 15% of the cover price?"
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:28.880]   When actually I can spend one weekend learning how to use this iWork-style tool and then
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.960]   put it toward all my audience members who happen to have iPhones and iPads, which might
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.800]   be a very solid chunk of their readership.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.880]   If this thing spreads to other devices, this is part of that migration away from centralized
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:45.680]   publishing and more towards individuals creating their own audiences and selling directly to
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.680]   them.
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:51.600]   I could see it being a garage band and then also a Final Cut Pro version, like an iMovie
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.200]   version of it that's easy for everybody to use.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.960]   Then the publisher is having their own version that gives them more tools.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.440]   In design level, they're going to want that.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.880]   They're not going to be satisfied with a garage band.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.600]   Well, there's a lot of things that you want to add.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.960]   You want to add class interaction and some really heavy tools that would be more complicated
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.680]   than just throwing a movie into it that you might add into a tool that you might sell
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.680]   for $300,000 or $500, or $1,000.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:15.680]   All right.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:16.680]   All right.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.680]   Rumor time.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.840]   I'd like to save this for the end.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.400]   iPad 3 will have a Retina display.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.400]   True or false?
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.400]   True.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.080]   And combined with the announcement that we're seeing on the 19th, that's a big deal.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.080]   True Andy?
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.080]   I agree.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.640]   Retina display 10.1 inches?
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.640]   I'm not sure if it's going to be 10.1 inches.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.080]   I believe it'll be the same aspect ratio as the current generation iPad.
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.480]   I think it's just going to be a higher definition.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.280]   I am not 100% sure it's going to be the same price point.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.320]   I think this is going to be the open door towards something that I was talking about
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.200]   last year where there's going to be a more expensive iPad and a less expensive iPad that
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.240]   has the previous generation technology.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.240]   Mr.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.240]   Dom McAllister, you agree?
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240]   True or false?
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.240]   Retina display.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.240]   Completely agree.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.600]   And with Andy as well, I think now is the time they're going to start sort of differentiates
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.800]   in between the standard iPad and the iPad Pro.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.360]   And the iPad Pro will be the more expensive model with the Retina display and quad processes
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.440]   possibly and extra RAM, et cetera.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.040]   You guys are all wrong.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.280]   It's not going to be a Retina display because if they do, they'll fragment the developer
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:27.720]   market and it'll be a nightmare to have to design for now three resolutions.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.720]   Never have them.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.720]   So, certainly.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.400]   Do you have a way around that?
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.920]   Just like the Retina display fragmented previous iPhones, did it?
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.120]   Oh, wait, no, it did not.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.520]   It did not do such a thing.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.520]   Why not?
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:45.000]   Same applications, but merely running at much, much easier to retest much, much better photos.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   All right, we'll see.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.720]   I mean, how these things work.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:48.720]   I know.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.640]   And by the way, it'll probably be true or false, March.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.640]   March.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:54.640]   March.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.720]   I'm seeing markers for March.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.720]   March.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.560]   Oh, you're all right on that one.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.560]   Quad core.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.560]   Okay.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.560]   Here's it.
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.560]   We real quick.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.560]   LTE.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:06.560]   What's your false time?
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.560]   McAllister.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:08.560]   Will it have 4G?
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.560]   False.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:13.560]   Your false andy and not go 4G.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.480]   I honestly do not know.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.600]   Oh, I've seen evidence for.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.600]   I've seen.
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.600]   Sorry.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.480]   We're asked when I say Retina display, I have seen markers that indicate that such
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.400]   a thing is going to happen very soon.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.400]   LTE.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.120]   I have not seen such markers, but the absence of such markers does not indicate absence
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.640]   of such a product coming soon.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.880]   Maybe your answer is maybe.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.880]   Sure.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.360]   How about you, Alex Lindsey?
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.520]   LTE True 4G.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.520]   No.
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.520]   Well, LTE is 4G.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:41.520]   What are you telling you talking about?
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.520]   B.S.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.520]   4G ish.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.520]   You mean real 4G?
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.520]   That's not a real 4G.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.520]   How do you make it 4G?
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.520]   Well, no, of course not.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.520]   There's nobody in America that can offer out a megabit.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.520]   So LTE.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.520]   Yes.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.520]   LTE.
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.520]   4G.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.520]   No.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   pseudo 4 American 4G.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.520]   US 4G.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.520]   Exactly.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.320]   I think you guys are yes, right.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:04.520]   And I'll tell you one thing that this kind of an interesting statement came from Verizon
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.520]   at CES.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.600]   They said, "We will no longer sell any device that doesn't have LTE."
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.960]   Except for push to talk.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.120]   Does Verizon do push to talk?
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.120]   They said they did.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   I think there was some kind of...
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.280]   There's one solution that they had.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.880]   But unless they do a push to talk iPad, it's got to be LTE.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.800]   I'm not sure because Verizon doesn't have their corporate communications as under a
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.800]   tight last O.S.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.800]   Apple does.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.760]   They could be talking about...
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.680]   This could be a spokesperson who's not completely in the loop about what Apple's going to be
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.680]   doing in the future.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.840]   And it's possible that they could also waffle later on and say, "Well, technically the
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.200]   iPhone we create is a different product category.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.200]   It's not a phone.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.200]   It's more of a communication device."
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.760]   So I don't know if that's a slam dunk.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:49.120]   Bloomberg says Apple's bringing LTE to the iPad before the iPhone because it's got a
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.120]   bigger battery.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.120]   That I could definitely believe.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.120]   Makes sense.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:58.360]   I think Apple would only do 4G LTE if they could do it in a way that would be free, quote
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.360]   unquote.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.360]   If it has to be...
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.440]   If there has to be a real trade-off for the user, they wouldn't do it.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.440]   And more...
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.440]   That battery's a little bit more.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.280]   I'm hearing thicker because double the battery life.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.480]   True or false, Don McAllister.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:14.520]   Yeah, we keep hearing rumors about it being slightly thicker because of the battery increase
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.760]   in the battery size.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.880]   Because I'll need a bigger battery as well for the retina display.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.480]   So yeah, I wouldn't surprise me to see it go slightly thicker.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.880]   Will the battery life go up or will it just maintain?
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.320]   Possibly up slightly.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.320]   It depends how thick they can actually make it and get away with really.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.080]   But at the moment, I think the current iPad is slightly too thin as far as I'm concerned.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.840]   I'd like to have a bit more effed.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.840]   You agree, Alex Lindsey?
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.640]   I would love to see it a little thicker.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.640]   Thicker?
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.640]   I think that the iPad right now is...
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.640]   I feel like it's more fragile.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.640]   I feel like it's more lasting.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   Thicker and longer.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.960]   Annie and Oco, do you believe in the Viagra iPad?
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   Thicker and longer lasting.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.440]   I was gonna say we have a show title.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:55.440]   I think that Apple will happily make the iPad thicker if it will give tangible benefits.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.760]   I'm not sure that they're married to having the paper thin, roll it up and stick in your
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.160]   back pocket iPad at this juncture.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.520]   Does that mean you have to take it back to the Apple store if it's running for more
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.520]   than four hours?
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.520]   I am going to...
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.520]   Yes, see your doctor.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.320]   I am going to go on the limb here and say we will have a push to talk iPad in March.
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:12.320]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.840]   And an extendable antenna.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.840]   Yay!
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:15.840]   Yay!
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.840]   Hello, Billy.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.840]   This is Tommy.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.400]   It's like I heard you from two yards away.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.120]   The crystal ball is a little fog gear for an iPhone 5, although if they're gonna do an
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.120]   iPhone...
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.480]   Remember, when they first announced the iPhone, they announced it in January for June release.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.480]   They squeezed that time.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.640]   But that wasn't weighed down on the last iPhone.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.640]   That was an FCC issue.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.640]   So what do you think?
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.000]   Will we see an iPhone in June or thereabouts?
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   Maybe.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   No iPhone.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   I don't have any...
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   I don't have any.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   I'm not tracking that.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   No clues on that.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   Anybody else?
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   Clues?
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   I guess.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   So they're gonna have to bring something big out for WWDC, aren't they?
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.080]   That's the major event for June.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.080]   Possibly.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.080]   Possibly.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.080]   Andy?
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.480]   I'm guessing that they're gonna wait.
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   I think they would show it off in June and not commit to a June ship date.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.840]   That's just a guess.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:11.680]   I'm not sure if the September release of the 4S was a one-off or more of a, "Here's
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:17.160]   what this will do to our production schedule and our employees if we'd stopped trying
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:21.120]   to put all the announcements in the first half of the year."
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.120]   I also think...
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.200]   I'll flip the coin and say yes.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:28.920]   I think I was talking to Tom about this at CES when we were talking about...
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:33.480]   I was talking to manufacturers about why there's so much stuff for the iPhone and not
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.160]   as much stuff for the Android.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.320]   One of the big things was the...
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.320]   Fragmentation?
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.160]   No, it was shelf life.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:44.760]   The fact that the iPhone form factor doesn't change very often makes it much easier.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:48.720]   It's fragmentation of the market and the two big things were...
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.840]   Fragmentation of the market and shelf life were the two largest things.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.880]   And then after that it was that iPhone users will buy crazy stuff for...
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:02.080]   Actually, we just saw some stats from Tango, which makes an iPhone and Android VoIP program.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:08.680]   And even though they've slowed slightly more tangos for Android, the upsell is like four
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.480]   times higher on the iPhone.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:15.440]   iPhone users are four times 400% more likely to buy the next level up.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.280]   They spend more money on their apps.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.760]   Not 'cause they're necessarily 'cause they're more affluent.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.360]   I don't know if that's the case, but...
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.360]   They're just crazy.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.360]   They'll buy anything.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.600]   We're gonna take a break when we come back, our Lion Tip, our iOS Tip, and our PIX of the
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:32.440]   week with this great panel, Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times, Don McAllister from
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:39.840]   ScreenCasts Online, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core, and I come to you from the future.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:40.840]   The future?
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:41.840]   The future.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   Wow.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.760]   Where everybody listens to audio books all the time.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.120]   We heard of this thing called text.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.120]   Yes.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.120]   What is it?
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.120]   What is it?
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.120]   What is it?
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.120]   No idea.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120]   They would take ink and put it on the paper.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.280]   You know they used to kill trees so that you could read a book.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.800]   They used to kill trees.
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.800]   Now they just kill electrons at audible.com.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.360]   Audible, 100,000 books.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.680]   In the future, it'll be more.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.000]   But right now it's 100,000 books.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.440]   I'm gonna go out on a limb and say in the future, there will be more books on Audible.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.840]   I think that's not very much.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.840]   That's not very...
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:18.640]   Actually, you know what's really happened is now every bestseller that comes out is on
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.640]   Audible day and day.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   Are you like me?
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.640]   I see a new book come out and I go, "Oh, is it on Audible?"
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:23.640]   The first thing I do.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:24.640]   No, check mine.
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.640]   You notice I have zero credits.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.560]   I'm waiting until the 22nd when my two credits kick in.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.920]   I love Audible and I know you will too.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:34.960]   That's why we've arranged a free book for you at Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.920]   You'll be signing up for the gold account.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.680]   That's one book a month.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.680]   First month is free.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:40.680]   First book is free.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.680]   You get a credit.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.880]   Some books are more than one credit.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.280]   Very few.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.280]   And it's yours to keep forever.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.360]   You cancel at any time so there could be no cost to you.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.120]   Now Andy Anaco.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.080]   Andy Anaco, all of us is a major Audible fan.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:55.640]   He loves to have an Audible pick of the week and I'm going to let him do it.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.080]   This is another good one.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.640]   But I have to explain.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.520]   Audiobooks are a special sort of beast.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:04.520]   It's not just the book itself which is also available on Kindle.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.520]   It's also available on iBooks.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.640]   It's also available in the Dead Tree Wear.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.400]   But it's also like who is the person reading this and how much fun are you going to have
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.400]   listening to this person in your car for 10 hours?
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.080]   Normally I would say don't get the author to read it because most authors can't read
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.080]   it.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.440]   This is a major exception.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:25.520]   I will give you the title which will not impress you and then the name which will cause you
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.960]   to buy this book.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.920]   The title is the Elephant to Hollywood.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.080]   The reader is the author Michael Cage.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.080]   Oh, all right.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.080]   Alfie raids it.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.080]   Let's see.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.240]   I've got to hear this live.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.840]   Michalene and Sydney and Joanna Poitier.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.200]   It was a fabulous group to spend a holiday with.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.200]   Oh my God.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:48.000]   I don't ski but I have really worked hard at developing my apresqui skills.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.720]   I love Michael Cage.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.240]   I want to spend 10 hours with him in my ears.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:58.400]   He is for real Michael Cage.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:02.600]   You get to the story where he's saying of course I was pulled back then.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.360]   We used to have these parties called bottle and a bird.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.560]   You bring a bottle and a bird.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.960]   I didn't have much money.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.960]   That's why I brought two birds.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.640]   Oh, this is great.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.560]   By four hours in it's like hello.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.400]   I've hit a pickup on dry cleaning.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.400]   I don't know.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.560]   Two shots and a tall full dice.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.560]   You're good.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.040]   All you have to do is listen to this and you'll be able to do Michael Kane.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.480]   A perfect Michael Kane.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.160]   She was only six feet.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.160]   Yes.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.320]   So it's also it's also he's an actor.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.960]   He's also like came to prominence like in the 60s and 70s.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.160]   He has all these really great drunk actors stories.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:43.320]   This is also stories of like going to the Cannes Film Festival with John Lennon.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.720]   That's money in the bank right there.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.760]   But really you're there to hear Michael Kane talk to you for 10 hours straight.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:50.760]   Oh my I'm done.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.120]   It's done sold done.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.720]   So look at the moment of common sense as soon as I as soon as you said Michael Kane
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:58.920]   now reads an audiobook.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.920]   There you go.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.600]   Let's hear a little bit more.
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:06.800]   Aspen is all about as we set around enjoying the sunshine.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.880]   Gossle being about old times and eating fabulous food with this great group of people.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.680]   I felt pretty happy with my lot.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.000]   Everyone there had been a part of my life since I first got the Hollywood.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.160]   Although in fact I met Sean in London back in the late 1950s.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.800]   Michael Kane the elephant to Hollywood.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.840]   And I'm sure he explains the title at some point.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.240]   You know they have a lot of showbiz titles.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:35.840]   Dick Cavitt his memoirs Dick Van Dyke his memoirs Rob Lo just came out with one.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:39.240]   And in many cases when you get an actor you got to get them to narrate the book because
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:42.240]   that's their voice you know and you really do.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.360]   This book is mostly about his Hollywood ears on upward.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.800]   It's not that you don't get to hear.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.040]   I don't want to hear you.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.400]   My favorite school teacher.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.960]   No Mrs. Bob Wilson.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.600]   We would learn these following 19 subjects.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.480]   Best history and then geography.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.480]   Okay.

[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.640]   you all your recently closed tabs so you can tap on that and reopen the tab again it's
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:27.680]   like history yes like a tab history so any any tabs that you close recently it remembers
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.640]   them tap and hold on the button at the end of the tab row and it will give you a pop up
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:38.320]   with a list of the tabs that you've closed recently very cool hmm press that and hold
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.760]   because yeah that's one of those things where I'm sure they documented somewhere but it's
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.120]   kind of hard to find yeah I've not I don't know where I came across that one it's not
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.560]   something I'd seen around very often but yeah it's a nice little tip especially if you you
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.880]   like me you open lots of tabs and then close them down again and then say what was that
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.640]   URL I wanted it's like a history for your tabs there is a great BBC show which you've probably
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:09.920]   seen called the trip mhm Stephen Coogan Steve Coogan's in it oh yeah yes there's a moment
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.240]   that's good and chatroom just reminded me of this actually haven't seen the trip I have
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:17.880]   seen this moment there is a moment where they they debate Steve this is right at the first
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:25.840]   episode Steve and his my finish they're going they're going on a trip they debate who has
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:30.560]   the better Michael Kane impression Steve Coogan or Rob Brydon we'll talk about that it's
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.480]   taking a little while a lot load so once it's loaded I'll play it for you meanwhile let's
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:40.440]   get a lion right tip from Andy and not go this is actually a Mac OS tip it works in previous
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.400]   versions of it as well a lot of people know that command shift three is for screen capture
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.880]   it will create a picture your entire screen and dump it to dump it to the the dump it to
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:54.480]   the disc a lot of people also know that command shift four will let you select part of the
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.880]   screen to capture that's very nice that's very good but there are two little tricks that
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.920]   make it a lot more useful particularly if you're often the habit of like you see something
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:07.800]   really cool in the web you just want to I said it's someone by I chat you can if you
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:13.240]   hold down the control key with control shift either one of those things it will send the
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:18.560]   graphic to the clipboard instead of to a file on the disk the other cool thing is if you're
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.160]   using command shift four if you hit command shift four that puts you into screen capture
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:26.920]   mode you'll get the crosshair so you can draw the box around the thing that you actually
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:31.440]   want to capture if you then hold down if you then just tap the space bar instead of the
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:36.000]   crosshair you'll now get a camera icon that will actually understand that okay he's hovering
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.640]   over a window if he clicks on that window I'll just capture that window I don't even
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:46.520]   act at a cool little drop shadow to it for good measure so that works that the camera
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:55.360]   the single window works whether you use that as a matter of fact this was making it first
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:01.400]   I think appeared I think with 10.5 I know because I David Pogue and another author we're all
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:06.000]   like writing our OS books at the same time and we're like we've been beaten up by Apple
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.160]   pretty badly with like late updates and suddenly like did you have you tried this do you know
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:13.840]   how fast you do screenshots with this oh my god no I didn't let me tell you oh my god
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:19.520]   you're right that does work so yeah that is awesome huh just so command you for to do
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:24.000]   the the the clip and then hit the space bar and you'll get a camera just tap the space
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.880]   bar right and you'll get it all and now it is time my friends for our picks of the week
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:34.440]   we'll start to since Sandy and Don did tips we'll start with you Alex Lindsey what have
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:39.640]   you brought us so I have this how is that well first of all before I get into the hardware
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:42.800]   the one thing I don't think we've talked about it on Mac break I know you guys have talked
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:48.640]   about it on iPad today snap seed if you haven't gotten it just caught by love it it's a iPad
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:53.720]   iOS app that is just it's the best filters ever it's the best photo app ever it's from
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:57.760]   Nick software that's why it's so good insane I have a camera for you Alex right you see
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.400]   where your coffee mug is you want to show whatever your yeah wow you guys are so good
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:09.360]   oh my goodness so wow you see snap seed some modern so what you can do is you can take
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:15.080]   a you know any photo here's an example photo but it just has lots of little filters that
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:19.080]   lets you start to you know you can it's just like this great way you can just kind of drag
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:24.280]   on it and have you know and take you know just kind of do some really really quick effects
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:28.920]   and you know we go back and you know I can open let me open one here for my photo library
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:35.360]   just to kind of show you the my my daughter I took one photo of her kind of you know this
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:40.680]   is what it looked like I don't even need it here you it's really easy to do the effects
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:47.880]   I just want to show you the before and after the so I took a photo that was like this right
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:54.200]   so it's just her in a crazy Russian thing she was running around in and in like two
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:33:00.040]   seconds I was posting it on path in like two seconds I turned it into that that's beautiful
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:03.760]   which was this kind of just artsy kind of beautiful I don't know how you did that but
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:07.560]   that's and it was just like bam bam bam and I mean literally like with less than a minute
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:12.280]   I had this thing that looks kind of this kind of artsy little painting almost it's kind
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:15.680]   of hard to see in the image but you can see your eyes in there and it's just anyway it's
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.880]   amazing and you it's for you know of course as everything else is $2.99 or whatever so
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:24.760]   it's worth it this is what I actually want to show though so I just want to say that
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:31.400]   all right is the scosh skosh skosh fit rail so I've been in this this mode of trying to
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:38.040]   find the right rail for my exercise bike so so that I could you know I can do proper
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:42.160]   multitasking right so what this is this folds up into almost nothing so you can bring
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.440]   it together and you want to take it be able to take it to the exercise bike I have one
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:50.960]   in my house so I don't so it's tiny seeing tiny but what you do is you swing this open
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.760]   and you put it over top of the exercise bike you unwrap this and you can open it up like
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:01.200]   this and then so this this this little guy here is your this hooks over top of your exercise
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:06.440]   bike and allows you to put your iPad right into this little groove here and this little
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:11.600]   so this stuff here is sticky so it's got kind of like a little I don't know it's nano
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:16.560]   technology whatever makes it sticky so so anyway what's great about is you can take
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:23.440]   it to the gym with you I just put it on my on my on my bike but it hooks on really well
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.520]   it's very stable and if you want to be able to use like the perfect solution for me is
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:34.760]   you're able to watch watch the news or watch Netflix and then use flip board and bike and
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:38.840]   I kind of need to do that because I get really bored with biking so and I try to bike a
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:42.900]   lot something to do anything to do and so it turns into like the perfect multitasking
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.920]   kind of situation it's it's the scoash fit rail and it's I think forty nine dollars
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:52.320]   is the retail and you know I have gone through a lot of ways of doing this and this is by
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:57.720]   far the the best one that I found awesome thank you so much that's all I have to say
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:03.560]   and I go would you like to do a pick here yeah this is a simple one but a simple idea
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:12.080]   but a really great one this is the popa remote camera the popa camera thing of a bob yeah
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:18.080]   what is that or the that looks so cool it's what it is is it's just a all it is is like
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:24.080]   a metal machine handle with a button and a dock connector on it and you click it onto
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:31.000]   the end of your iPhone yeah and now you actually get just a regular big ass camera button for
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:37.440]   taking pictures with the iPhone and it's funny oh it's also a big camera handle with
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.760]   their tripod mount so if you're actually one of these people who uses the iPhone just
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:45.760]   as a camera and you're in a situation like you're at a party or you're you know for
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:49.880]   in the Smithsonian this is not going to drop out of your hands this is not going to you
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.800]   know that you're not going to have to worry about if you're basically trying to hold it
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:57.480]   as sort of a weird angle you are going to be able to get the shot without trying to
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:03.520]   figure out exactly where the mechanical shutter button is on the screen it feels like a million
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.040]   bucks you also have a tripod mount it also comes with a lanyard so you can actually
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:13.320]   keep it like land you're did to your to your hand I was at the Mac tech conference we did
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:17.960]   a tour of universal studios in the motion ride where you go past the jaws shark and you
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:23.320]   go through the King Kong 3D like rotating tunnel and believe me it was not a lot of fun holding
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.160]   onto my slippery little iPhone with both hands as the boat was rocking with this it's pretty
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:32.200]   much the perfect how secure do you feel like it is it really in there this is not coming
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:38.080]   out is a matter of fact it comes off I am literally trying hard to pull it off that's
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:42.840]   really you actually that was really handy get it off yeah also it's it's nicely designed
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:48.920]   to like obviously this is going to when you have this docked on here you're not going
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:52.360]   to be able to fit it inside your camera case you're not your your iPhone case you're not
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.040]   going to be able to fit in a lot of things they kind of anticipate that you're probably
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:01.400]   going to be taking on and taking off so I have to zoom in for this here around the
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:06.640]   around the tripod mount is this little grip right here and so when you when it's time
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.680]   to put it back in your pocket oh goodness no autofocus there you go watch what happens
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:16.120]   there you go and now the dock connector is stowed away because you twisted it closed
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:24.000]   it's never everything any ever has three drawbacks which I'll go through one through
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.680]   three it does not work with the built-in camera app you have to use the POPA app which is of
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:35.440]   course a free download from the app store yeah I don't know why that doesn't work also
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:41.040]   I keep trying to figure out whether or not and also I really wish it were possible so that
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.000]   when this thing is docked the active press on this button causes that app to go to become
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.800]   the forward thing so that I can understand what you can't just always no matter what
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.520]   app you're in we click this button it takes a picture but I would love it if you tap the
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:57.760]   button once if it's not the foreground app over becomes a foreground app and then it becomes
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.320]   your camera button so I really I've been talking to a couple of iOS developers to find out
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:08.280]   if that's even physically possible with with the app development kit I've been getting a
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:14.280]   responsive sort of maybe it depends it's not well documented so who knows the third problem
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:21.000]   is a little bit more serious in that I guess to get this to fit so tightly the fit is a
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:28.040]   little bit hit or miss in that once it's taking pictures it works fine for me especially since
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:32.640]   I updated the last version of the app however there are times when if I just simply grab
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:36.840]   this off grab this out of my my shirt pocket flip open to the camera app and take a picture
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:43.840]   it won't actually work and won't work until I undock and then dock it back in again so that's
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:48.600]   not one it's not a majority the case of the time but it has happened often enough that
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:52.960]   that's a problem given that in those scenarios we have to do a quick draw there's no such
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.040]   thing as a quick draw because I'll have to wake up the I'll still have to wake up the
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:00.480]   iPhone switch the popa app and then be ready to take a picture I don't think that it's
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:05.280]   a deal breaker as much as it could be but that's still something that I also wish that
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:10.000]   they would improve on for the future but given what this is and this is not the cheap piece
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.440]   of plastic it really does feel like an old the the grip of an old-fashioned like 35 millimeter
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:20.360]   range fighter camera also given that I really hope to see more accessories like this that
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:25.520]   now that we have a really very competent 8 megapixel camera that you could use as a substitute
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:29.760]   for real camera I really there's more to a camera than just the quality pictures it takes
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.000]   it's also the way that you handle it it's also the way that you can grab it without
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.160]   being scared of dropping the thing and so I'm really hoping that there are more devices
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:43.040]   like this it works okay for what it is right now it could work better the third problem
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:49.080]   actually though is that it is 50 pounds ridiculously expensive well it's a it's a it's a one of a
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:56.640]   kind that's 7080 bucks about 72 73 according current depends worth worth mentioning the
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.000]   regard they're going to be people that really really want something exactly like this I'm
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:07.200]   hoping that people who spend 50 pounds for this wolf helps us helps us subsidize the generation
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:11.920]   two version of this but I've they have not announced I'm saying that a hypothetical generation
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:17.360]   two which is more like a traditional camera sled maybe or really prosecute this this idea
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:21.360]   a little bit more strongly also it's really cool because if you're I've decided that if
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.560]   I'm ever in a really tricky situation where like people are advancing upon me I'll take
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.240]   this out like just as is and say well this is the dead man switch if my grip releases
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:40.240]   upon this the entire room blows so or at least my iPhone popa from everything beep.com a
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:46.120]   mere 50 pounds and now UK is got economic troubles too if you're putting more money
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:51.840]   into the UK economy you're a good global citizen yeah that's that's okay we're 1812
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:58.960]   was so long ago it's time to prove it and now from the other side of the pond mr. Don
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.560]   the callister with his pick of the week okay well it's a very simple application it's an
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.480]   application for the Mac I don't know about you but I tend to do most of my writing now
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:12.720]   I'm plain text I'm a big mark down fan and I do most of my writing in by word which is
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:17.840]   a plain text editor that has really good markdown support and if I come across an application
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:21.760]   where I need to do some writing in I ended up sort of copying from one application cop
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:26.440]   pasting it into by word and then do my editing and then copy it and I'm pasting it back into
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:30.520]   the application it came from but there's an application called quick cursor that automates
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:35.520]   that process it's very simple concept and it only supports a limited number of work
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.040]   processes but by word is one of them things like BB edited supports I think it supports
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.680]   well there's a whole list on the Mac App Store page but basically what you do is you set
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:48.640]   up a global hotkey so whenever you have a text entry field anywhere that you want to
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:53.840]   do some writing in you basically just hit the hotkey and it takes the contents of that
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:59.640]   text entry field and paste it into your text editor choice you do your editing and then
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:04.360]   when you finish editing it drops it back into the original text entry panel so that's
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.360]   sort of like a global word process for all your applications wherever you need to enter
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:15.680]   text you can actually use your favorite word processor to actually do that that's interesting
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:19.320]   yeah it's hard to explain but once you've used it a couple of times especially if you
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:23.160]   have a favorite text editor you know plain text editor that you use and you're more
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.720]   comfortable with writing in it works really really well it's by your hog bait software
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:33.560]   yeah Jesse does great stuff I love Jesse and I love supporting him he wrote yes he wrote
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:37.200]   right that's right in fact he wrote it for right room because he wanted to do that sort
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.800]   of thing you know he was used to writing in right room so he wanted a bridge to bridge
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:45.440]   any other any other applications where he had to enter text so he built it and then he
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.000]   just expanded on it and published it as quick cursor aquamax BB edit by word caught editor
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:57.160]   emacs espresso Mac Vim multi markdown composer small trons sub ether that edit text mate
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:03.680]   text Wrangler and write remote are supported and editors can actually amend their applications
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:06.600]   to make it work with it as well if they want to I think he's published some guidance on
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:11.840]   how you actually amend your text editor to work with it and you use it with which editor
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:16.560]   do you like to use I use by word I tend to use by word a lot for plain text editing you
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.960]   know sort of that's got great markdown support markdown would be handy it's very good might
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:32.600]   have to try this that is 499 in the US quick curse patterns 99 to 99 in the UK and that does
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:36.000]   it for our Mac break weekly I want to thank you so much for Don for being here we'll see

[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.200]   from here on Thursday so I don't have to.
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.200]   I will ask him.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.200]   I have asked him.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.200]   I haven't actually asked him yet.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.680]   You're going to be doing it.
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.680]   Well Tom could do it.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:21.680]   Whoever wants to.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:24.560]   Anybody can do it.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.160]   I guess that's all there is to say tomorrow is a very important day for the internet community.
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:35.680]   It's our protest our SOPA protest day many sites are going dark including Wikipedia,
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.480]   Reddit, Tumblr.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.160]   We are not going to go dark.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:40.400]   We thought about it.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:44.320]   I thought we could do a better job educating so you'll see what we do tomorrow.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:47.440]   We will certainly let you know you will know when it's the minute you tune in that it is
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:52.280]   a blackout day and we will cover the blackout day in detail with breaking news starting at
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:59.160]   1030 p.m. Pacific here right before we go into security now and we will have lots of
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:02.880]   anti-SOPA anti-PIPA information all day long.
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:08.240]   And no matter what happens tomorrow remember that the time now is to pile on.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:11.480]   It's old fashioned phones and snail mail.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:14.840]   That's what you want to be doing and you don't want to take look at this news like
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:20.080]   oh so is slowing down or whatever the time that you know now that we have some of them
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:21.080]   pile on.
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:25.960]   I know that they're clear and you did you see my post?
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.200]   No I haven't seen it.
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.200]   It's on Google+.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.200]   Okay good.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.040]   It's called if you go to my post and you see the manifesto because I think what we need
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:38.120]   to start thinking about beyond stopping SOPA and PIPA is building an organization that
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.040]   starts to pound the representatives that create these laws.
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.040]   We need a pack.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.040]   We need a pack.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.040]   Super pack.
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:45.040]   We need to take some money.
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:46.040]   Why not?
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:47.040]   And we need to show these guys what you can do.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.040]   Why not?
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.040]   What a bunch of internet folks can do.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:52.720]   Plus it if you think it's a good idea and if we get a high enough number we'll start
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.720]   doing it.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.920]   We're already starting to talk about some stuff.
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:03.160]   But check out what I say there and you can either agree or disagree but you can find
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.160]   me on Google+.
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:05.160]   I posted it.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.160]   It's called the manifesto.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.160]   The manifesto.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:09.480]   I got it right in front of me right there.
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.480]   Thank you everybody for joining us now.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.480]   Get back to work.
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:12.480]   Break time is over.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:22.480]   [MUSIC]
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.080]   (upbeat music)
