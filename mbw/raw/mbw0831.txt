[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy and Aco Alex,
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.920]   Lindsey, Jason, Snell.
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.120]   Yes, your favorites are here.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.960]   I'm here too.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.520]   We're going to talk about Apple making its employees
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.240]   return to work, even if they don't want to.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.080]   A single flaw that broke every layer of security in Mac OS
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.400]   and a Zoom problem that fortunately has just been fixed.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.880]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.960]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.560]   where we cover the latest news from Apple, Alex, Lindsey,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.080]   and the house from 090.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.480]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.320]   The office hours, that gloob.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080]   How'd it go this morning?
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.160]   Well, we had a mic off.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.880]   I've got like eight mics sitting in front of me.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.680]   So how does this one sound?
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.280]   That's fun.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.520]   We've got like a 70.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   But you still love that, Norm?
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.200]   You like that, Norm, in the best?
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.920]   You know, for the show, yeah.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.680]   I mean, for shows, this was my--
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.240]   the seven-- this is the TLM-102 by Noomen.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.920]   And it was my go-to for voiceovers for a long time.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.200]   And then-- so I still--
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   so when I'm doing my own shows, absolutely.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.600]   But a lot of times, we're trying to figure out
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.040]   what do we recommend to guests, and what do we send out
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.480]   to people, and what do we--
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.640]   you know, what does this look like,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.480]   and what does that look like?
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.040]   And so that's the--
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.960]   so anyway, yeah.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.440]   But this is a great-- I think it's a great mic.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's relatively small.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   You know, you can get, obviously, better Noemans,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.360]   but they get big real quick.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.880]   There's another one that's a 103, I think,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.960]   that's a little bit more expensive that I couldn't
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.040]   tell the difference between two.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.360]   So it's like, I'm not going to be another $600
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.240]   for a number of--
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   This is their home version.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.720]   Their home version.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.680]   The one thing I know that Noeman does
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.560]   is write, which is throw out a lot of condensers,
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.240]   because you make them, and then you have to test them.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.480]   And if they don't have the right curve,
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.760]   you throw them out, and a lot of cheaper companies just
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.760]   put them all in production.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.160]   So you get a really strange variation from--
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.560]   Yeah, you notice a lot of detail in areas
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.920]   that I don't get necessarily.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.080]   Although I use it for my house, and I have a noise assist
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.920]   that's turning off--
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.520]   I hear that.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.600]   --you know, getting rid of the fan noise.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.080]   Yeah, I hear that.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.600]   And then the-- but like the PR40 I use in the office,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.520]   because we have too many-- too much ancillary noise.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.320]   Yeah, this is real good.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.280]   Go back to a PR40 for that, yeah.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.320]   On the PR40 right now, weighing in at 102 pounds,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.360]   it is Andy Inacco of the beautiful WGBH in Boston.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.680]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.680]   Hello.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.000]   That would be kind of weird if I switched to the--
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.200]   to switch this microphone that I've been using for like 10
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.520]   years, because it's part of like-- it's part of like my visual
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.280]   user interface.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.720]   I think it cues my brain into getting into that very important--
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.320]   No, no, no.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   It's time.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.640]   You think that, but don't say that.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.240]   Or find a different way of saying that.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.880]   Don't just blur that out.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.000]   I'm a fan of dynamic, large, quote dynamics,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.200]   ever since Bob Heil introduced me to this mic.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.480]   But that's just personal.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.520]   Tastes also your voice, what goes with your voice,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.360]   and your voice sounds very nice on this.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.680]   As does Jason Snell, who is using something else.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.520]   A sure SM7B that was recommended to me for my voice.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520]   And isn't this great?
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.960]   It's mic break weekly, right?
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.200]   That's what we're doing here?
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.440]   It all got started by this guy Alex doing his eight mics.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.240]   Doing his thing.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.920]   I mean, my cast just should care about their mics.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.680]   And this is way more expensive than normal people should get.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.400]   But I--
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.240]   You have a $400 mic, which is used like radio stations everywhere.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.960]   Use this mic.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.040]   With a $700 interface, because it has gain issues.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.760]   But you know, that's fine.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.080]   They make a USB version of this basically
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.840]   now that it's actually pretty great and has better.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.320]   They do.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.880]   Yeah, that's the one I have.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.960]   That's the one for me.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.400]   This is the same.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.600]   Do you like that one Alex?
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   As well as the SM7B.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.400]   That's the one we send out.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.320]   So the MV7 has both XLR and USB out.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.760]   And we do send that out.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.920]   Now, we're doing the show with Michael Krasney.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.960]   And we are--
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   we moved him to the PR40, because we thought
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.240]   he sounded better than the MV7.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.520]   He has a nasal kind of higher pitched voice,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.480]   which the PR40 might help with the--
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.000]   But see, nothing's flat.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.080]   Everything has something.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.160]   Everything has sound.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.760]   And so he's--
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.360]   Yeah, the MV7 is--
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.160]   That's the one we send out.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.400]   He doesn't have all those complications
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.240]   that the SM7B has with the game.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.160]   And it's got USB.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.520]   And that's really like--
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.000]   That's the main thing.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.680]   --if I'm going to recommend a microphone to anybody who's
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.560]   just a podcaster.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.520]   It's going to be-- you probably--
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.000]   it'd be nice if you had XLR, but USB
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   so you don't have to carry an interface with you.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.680]   I travel with the MV7 for that reason,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.840]   because I don't have to bring an interface with it.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.040]   I should probably get a couple of these MV7s.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.240]   This is their Motiv, M-O-T-I-V line.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.240]   The tour started a while ago with microphones
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.960]   for the iPhone that plugged into the lightning port.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.280]   And then they slowly expanded it,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.320]   and they have software and stuff.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.800]   And I think they've done a good job.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.720]   They realized there was a pro-am market for microphones.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.520]   One that we tested this morning that we had.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.720]   And you can see it on the show is this T-bone, which comes
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.480]   out of Germany.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.720]   That counts out a little.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.240]   The MV7 beta, which sounds very close to the MV7.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.640]   Now, this one's only got XLR, but evidently I bought the one
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.720]   with the XLR.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.960]   There is one with the USB that I'm going to get to test,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.800]   but this one's only $85.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.000]   And so it's close.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.640]   But anyway, so we thought that that was kind of another
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.960]   interesting one that we're testing.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.280]   Is there a variation in the USB interfaces?
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.040]   Well, they're doing the processing.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.880]   So they are, it can be a little different.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.360]   It can sound a little different when it comes out.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.640]   And also, what does it do internally to send that USB
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.240]   signal out?
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.440]   So both this T-bone as well as the MV7,
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.040]   the XLR out, is negative, I want to say negative 58 or 56
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.600]   or something like that.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.320]   So you need what that means is that on the other end,
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.120]   your preamp has to have the--
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.960]   to take that mic and move it to a normal level.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.640]   If you're looking for something like negative 20
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.360]   or negative 24 Luffs, you're going to need to have something
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.440]   that has enough push to do that.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.080]   Now I use a lot of sound devices stuff, and it all has that.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.800]   But sometimes people then have to go to a cloud lifter,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   which is not a great--
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.560]   I guess just like DAX, that A to D converters,
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.080]   analog to digital converters, would have good and bad chips.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.600]   Huge.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.640]   It's a huge-- I mean, that's one of the reasons we use a lot
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.000]   of the sound device stuff, is because they're
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.600]   super quiet preamps.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.320]   Yeah, I really like this.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.240]   And then they have great limiters
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.960]   that are built into them if you happen to tap them.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.960]   And so it's just some of the highest quality preamps
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.720]   that you can get in a reasonable cost,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.880]   so you can definitely get really expensive.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.080]   Is that what you use, Jason?
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.880]   Is that your $700 office?
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.080]   USB pre2 is what I've got.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.880]   And it's because you need a lot of gain for this microphone.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.400]   And also, it's-- I mean, Mark O'Armit turned me onto it.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.600]   It's also built like a tank.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   I mean, that's what I like about it.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.480]   It's metal.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.520]   It's got lots of physical controls on it.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.560]   And it's got some dip switches that you can set.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   It's got dip switches.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.480]   Love a dip switch for some stuff.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.080]   There's no software for it.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.960]   There's nowhere to do it.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.200]   I think I picked up one in my office that it had--
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.480]   or USB pre2 number 61 point.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.560]   And we just put them in everything.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.160]   They're like the Swiss Army.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.960]   I keep thinking, I wonder if they're
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.120]   going to update these someday.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.560]   But at the same time, I'm like, I don't know what they would
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560]   change.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.360]   These things are just-- they're just beasts.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.280]   I was having some recording issues recently.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.280]   And I was like, I'm just moving over to the back to the USB
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.400]   pre2, and everything was fixed again.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.440]   It's good.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.240]   So there you go.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.920]   Mike, break weekly.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.040]   And that courtesy of our Discord channel,
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.320]   we are now going to perform a mic drop.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.600]   Well, there it goes.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.480]   That's a picture of a kid with a piece of paper that says,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.080]   Mike, on it.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.440]   And he drops it, because--
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.440]   That's the one way to do it.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:14.440]   He's a kid.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.920]   And he can't afford a fancy mic, especially one
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.400]   that he could drop.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.240]   Lava's damage.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.520]   Lava's damage.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.240]   You can drop the Shure SM58, however.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.120]   That's OK.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.120]   You're allowed to drop that.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.520]   You can actually drive nails with it,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.960]   and then go back to your show.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.880]   You know, it's time for fun.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.400]   David Letterman used to.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.800]   We were talking about Letterman before the show.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.400]   He used to.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.440]   I saw it once.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.600]   And it was great to saw it.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.640]   And I know you've seen it live as well, Andy.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.360]   And in his pre-show, he has an SM58,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.240]   this Shure microphone used in punk rock clubs everywhere,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.440]   on a long cable.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.000]   And he swings it around.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.640]   He hits it on the ground.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.520]   He plays with the thing.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.600]   And it's all dented that metal screen.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.520]   It's hysterical, but it still sounds fine.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.160]   The key is just don't give the talent one with a switch.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.160]   I think, yes, that's right.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.800]   Because it's a switch.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   It's not a lot of switch.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.080]   Oh, how many times do we have switch?
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.600]   Don't kill the switch.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.960]   All of ours have switches on them, which is a mistake.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.760]   I put switches on the ones for talkbacks.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.840]   We use these in our mixers.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.440]   So who want to talk into someone's ear?
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.000]   Like, hey, if I can give it to a client,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.240]   we have other ways to do it for ourselves.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.680]   But if we're going to give it to a client,
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.200]   we give them the switch.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.600]   But we don't give the talent.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.040]   No, talent is a little fiddle with whatever switches.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.680]   Yeah, you give them.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.880]   Well, I think any Apple employees
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.440]   that bought microphones for their fine Zoom setup
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.160]   can now rest easy.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.240]   They're going back to work.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.920]   According to Bloomberg, Apple has told employees,
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.320]   you must work at least three days a week starting Labor Day.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.920]   It's not the day after September 5th.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.120]   That's appropriate.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.520]   Come back, but don't wear white pants.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.360]   Yes, no white belts, no white pants.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.960]   It's time to go to a dark pants.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.680]   So at least three days a week,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.080]   here's the thing that's really annoying.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.680]   They specify the days.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.720]   So you'll have to work Tuesdays, Thursdays,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.040]   and a third day to be determined by your team director,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.920]   which is like, well, what about Wednesday?
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.360]   Can we do Wednesday?
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.520]   So I have a long weekend?
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.960]   No, you're going to do Friday and like it.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.560]   How annoying.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.480]   I do see Wednesday.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.440]   I'm going to guess that Wednesday will be almost as busy
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.680]   as Tuesday and Thursday, because everyone's going to go.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.000]   Wednesday, please.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.320]   We're going to put it out.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.360]   I think everyone's going to choose Wednesday
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   if they're for a third day.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.000]   But your boss gets to choose it.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.240]   That's the problem.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.960]   Well, I think you're still asked to put up with you.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.400]   Is this kind of retro?
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:29.920]   That's true.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.320]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.040]   Is this kind of retro?
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.080]   Is this old-fashioned?
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.160]   I know companies like Twitter, and I
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.560]   can't remember what Google's policy is,
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.320]   but a lot of companies are saying never, never come back.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.680]   I think that there's a corporate culture thing
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.760]   that I've talked to a couple executives at.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.200]   It's not this company, but other companies.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.680]   And there is a concern that there's
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.880]   a certain corporate culture of having everyone there,
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.080]   that they are concerned that people can get their work done,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.000]   but at some point, they're looking at multiple-year erosion
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.360]   of company culture and how we approach things.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.720]   And so I think that that's one of the concerns
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.840]   that they have is allowing it to keep going down that path.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.800]   It also means that by saying everyone's
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.600]   got to be there Tuesday and Thursday,
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.640]   it means that if you want to do something for lunch,
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.880]   for the employees, something during the break
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.440]   or the middle of the day, because really, in most
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.000]   of these companies, being in the office
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.760]   means that you have to be available for meetings
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.520]   between, I think, it's usually 10 and 4, or 930 and 430
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.240]   or something like that.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.280]   It's not really like they all get their crack of dawn
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:28.920]   or whatever.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.320]   And a lot of people come in earlier, or they leave late,
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.440]   but they have to be there in that window.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.120]   So that gives the company a window to--
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.200]   if they want to do an all-hands to a clock,
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.320]   they know that people will be there,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.480]   or if they want to do some kind of outdoor party
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.600]   or something they can plan around,
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.520]   people are actually going to be at the event.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.920]   So I think that that's probably why they're
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.680]   standardizing on a couple of days.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.240]   And then again, I think Wednesday would probably
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.000]   be pretty busy.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.160]   And I think it'll be really interesting to see
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.600]   a lot of employees have kind of--
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.760]   they've burrowed in.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.640]   They've turned their garages into offices.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.000]   They've turned their guest room into offices.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.080]   They've moved to Tahoe.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.040]   They've tried a lot of things.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.800]   And I think that that's going to be a really--
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.280]   I think Apple pulled away partially because of COVID
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.960]   in the spring, but also partially because a lot of people
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.040]   leave in pretty quickly.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.080]   And I think they need to stop and think about this for a minute.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.840]   And so I think it'll be interesting to see now
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.280]   that they're turning back on again what happens again.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.600]   I think a lot of it also has to do with the fact
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.040]   that they have all this real estate that they've invested
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.840]   in, a tremendous amount of capital,
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.160]   on the pretext that we are going to have to house these many
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.040]   employees on an actual campus.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.880]   Some of the deals that they got with the communities
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.840]   that they built in are contingent on.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.720]   We will be bringing X number of employees into your town.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.960]   And they will be probably going out to lunch
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.600]   and spending money and generating tax revenue
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.600]   while they're there.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.080]   But the other sickening aspect of it
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.680]   is that managers want employees inside the office
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.080]   because it's easier to conduct surveillance on them
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.440]   inside the office.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.520]   Otherwise, you have to basically force them
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.760]   to turn their workspace at home into a surveillance state
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.120]   through software, through webcams.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.200]   That can't be covered up.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.240]   Microphones that can't be covered up.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.200]   I know that they're using this kind of software
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.240]   inside the office as well.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.440]   But this is becoming the pretext that a lot of different
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.880]   management structures are using to basically be able to look
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.960]   at metrics and say, hey, on Tuesday afternoons,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:37.000]   consistently from two to three, you're only typing 40%
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.520]   of the time and 30% of the time you're not even looking
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.040]   at the screen.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.640]   What's up with that?
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.120]   That's stealing from the company.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.560]   So this is part of the ongoing labor battle
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.080]   in the text sphere.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.000]   No less than in place else.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   I think that may happen in some companies.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.320]   I don't think that Apple's too worried about micromanaging
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.040]   people's time.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.400]   Because there's a lot to do as an Apple employee.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.000]   That's the impression I get, at least.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.240]   There's a lot to get done.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.320]   And you show up pretty quickly as someone who isn't getting it
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.520]   done if you don't.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.400]   So why make them come back?
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.040]   But again, I think it's a corporate culture.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.320]   I think it's mostly a corporate culture concern
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.720]   that there is a certain way of--
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.760]   And again, the ability--
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.280]   We already saw that.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.520]   We already saw that letter from employees the last time
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.640]   Apple produces.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.200]   Jason, is it retro to say you've got
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.560]   to come to the office to get a job?
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.880]   I think a lot of-- depends on the job, obviously.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.800]   We make our-- some of our talent has to come in.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.280]   Our staff--
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.120]   Yeah, I mean, the blanket statement is the problem, right?
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.040]   But I do think--
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.080]   I think Apple has a corporate culture of people being in seats.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.640]   I think it stems from Steve Jobs.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.480]   There's a story.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.440]   My friend James Thompson tells he worked on the Finder
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.080]   team back in the early days of OS 10.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.680]   And he was in Ireland at Apple's Cork offices.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.120]   And Steve Jobs basically found out
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.680]   that one of the Finder engineers was in Ireland
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.720]   and said he needs to move here or he is out.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.800]   And James was like, goodbye.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.120]   And I think that Steve Jobs and I had managers like this too.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.360]   They want to see butts in seats.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.720]   They believe in this.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.280]   And I don't want to call it a myth.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.560]   But I think the serendipity of bumping into people
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.400]   at the coffee pot and having a brilliant conversation
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.240]   or having some amazing conversation in a meeting somewhere,
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.480]   it does happen.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.520]   It does happen.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.800]   But I think that it's overstated.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.480]   And it's used as an excuse by a lot of managers
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.280]   because they just want to see their people and observe them.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.880]   And while Andy talks about the time surveillance
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.920]   that some companies are doing with remote workers,
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.200]   I think it's a softer kind of observation like,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.240]   if I see you, I know you're present in the office
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.360]   and not messing around at home.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.760]   The problem is the truth with a lot of these knowledge workers
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.320]   is you can measure their success or failure at their job.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.840]   And it doesn't have to equate to how long they
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.640]   sat in your office to do it.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.680]   And Apple culturally has been reluctant
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.600]   to embrace that for some groups.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.120]   Again, there's some groups that it probably
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.600]   doesn't make sense for them to be remote.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.800]   But I've also worked in remote work groups.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.280]   And it's been great.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.520]   And my overarching feeling about Apple
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.880]   is that I really wish Apple would do a rethink
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.040]   about what jobs and groups need to be present,
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.560]   how often they need to be present,
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.280]   and what jobs don't need to be present.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.920]   Because while Andy's right, they've invested a lot
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.000]   in real estate, they also rent a lot of office space
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.840]   in the South Bay.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.600]   They could probably afford to take some
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   of their jobs virtual.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.480]   And you know what?
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.080]   The cost of living in the South Bay is extremely high.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.360]   And there is a talent loss that will happen.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.800]   - That's a big part of the problem, isn't it?
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.280]   - From people who can't afford to or for lifestyle reasons,
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.880]   or starting a family or whatever,
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.960]   do not want to have to commute to Cupertino,
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.080]   a suburb that doesn't have public transportation, by the way,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.920]   every day.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.480]   So I think the brain drain, if I were an Apple executive,
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.200]   I would be most concerned that our policies were so strict
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.320]   that we're gonna have a brain drain.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.640]   We're gonna lose people to remote work elsewhere,
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.320]   and that we need to have a strategy.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.640]   And I think the reality is that they're gonna start
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.120]   making exceptions for great employees that they wanna retain.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.040]   And instead of doing that remote policy all at once,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.200]   they're just gonna essentially do it over time
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.360]   by letting people leave and keep their jobs
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.120]   'cause they can't afford to lose them.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.720]   - And I think that rethinking the open office
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.320]   for a lot of these companies, and some of them are,
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.560]   obviously because of COVID, it doesn't work at all,
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.040]   but the employees hated it before that.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.200]   - Weirdly, Apple dropped their mask mandates
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.880]   a few weeks ago in the public areas.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.320]   - Yeah, but the main thing, the problem in the public areas
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.640]   is not COVID, it's really the fact that
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.600]   you can't have a conversation.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.920]   You can't think straight, everyone's talking to you
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.760]   all the time. - Yeah.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.600]   - And they say, well, it's really,
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.960]   you managers were talking about it.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.480]   There was someone who said, "As a manager,
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.640]   "I just love being able to walk over
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.920]   "and talk to an engineer."
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.240]   And I'm like, "As someone who used to be an engineer,"
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.200]   or "an engineer," I was like, "I hate that."
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.880]   Like, that is like, I was in the middle
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.000]   of trying to figure something out,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.360]   and now you interrupted it, and your five-stop question
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.200]   is now costing an hour of figuring out where I was again.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.760]   And so, the thing is, is that it is,
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.280]   I do think that they're a serendipity.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.520]   I do think that these big companies,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.600]   there are things you talk about at lunch
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.160]   that you run into someone,
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.240]   and the problem is like, we've replaced a lot of that
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.840]   in office hours because we're open,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.120]   we think, called after hours,
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.160]   where people are there 21 hours a day,
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.600]   and we have a lot of that serendipity.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.120]   People just come on and start talking about something,
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.280]   start showing something, everything else,
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.480]   but you can't do that at Apple
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.080]   because everything stops you crying.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.440]   So you can't just have a video feed
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.760]   that people can just hang out in.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.000]   And so I think that's one of the challenges is they,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.040]   it does reduce some of that, that,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.400]   and I do think that there is serendipity
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.200]   at some of these companies
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   that you would lose out on,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.720]   but I think that there's a lot of valid reasons.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.000]   And again, the most valid reason is,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.280]   is that, wow, is it expensive in the South Bay to live?
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.600]   And it just puts so much pressure on people who are there
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.200]   because you buy a house,
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.880]   and now you have a mortgage of $5,000.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.440]   I mean, let's see this,
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   mortgage in San Jose or in Cupertino
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.040]   is three to $6,000 for a, not a great house,
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.640]   three to $6,000 a month for not--
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.160]   - You may be underselling it, in fact.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.160]   - No, no, it can be much closer to $10,000 a month
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.080]   that you're paying for a rundown house.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.160]   - Let's just take a look.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.920]   - Or not rundown, or like a 10 to 20,000.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   - Here's a nice, here's a beautiful ranch style home
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.880]   in Cupertino, three-bed two-bed.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.720]   - Yeah, ranch style.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.560]   - 1200 square feet, 1.9 million dollars.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.560]   - And what's the payment on it?
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.440]   - Let's just go down a little bit on Zillow.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.880]   - The zest, oh, that's the zestimate.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.200]   Where's the monthly cost?
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.000]   $10,000.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.120]   - $10,000 a month.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.080]   That's based on your mortgage and property taxes
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.600]   and home insurance.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.280]   - So it's just super expensive,
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.560]   and it puts so much pressure on the employees
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.080]   because it's not just does their salary,
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.040]   I mean, it means that their salary's
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.320]   a really high for Apple,
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   but it also means that if I lose this job,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.960]   I lose my house, I have to do it.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.000]   Like, can I find another job that's gonna pay
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.600]   the same number that,
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.640]   you know, when you have to start making $200,000,
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.920]   $300,000, $400,000 a year,
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.960]   that's in the rest of the country.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.000]   That's a pretty rarefied space, you know?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.840]   - And we think it.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.080]   - And so, yeah.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.760]   - We think about Apple and we think about,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.320]   like, the creative people who are doing like,
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.680]   oh, we're doing the hardware or we're, you know,
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.760]   or I'm programming the operating system.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.760]   And although I would say that some of those jobs
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.880]   probably can be remote too,
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.200]   I think James could have built the Finder
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.800]   from Ireland just fine,
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.560]   and collaboration tools have gotten a lot better
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.640]   in the last 20 years.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.520]   We've learned that we can do a lot of things remotely.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.400]   We put the lie to this story
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.760]   that people couldn't work remotely.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.860]   And now everybody's trying to claw it back.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.480]   But let's just not forget,
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.240]   there are lots of jobs at Apple that are not those jobs.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.440]   There are lots of jobs at Apple
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.920]   that are in Cupertino or Sunnyvale or San Jose
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.360]   because they've always been there
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.320]   and because it's corporate culture for them to be there.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.640]   And that's my problem with this blanket announcement
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.140]   by Tim Cook and Apple about this,
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.800]   is that I really wish they had done a little more soul searching
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.820]   about what jobs needed to be present and what didn't.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.260]   But like I said, I think in the end,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.740]   it's not gonna matter because they're gonna have a great person
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.680]   that they want to keep or hire,
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.580]   and they're not gonna want to live in Cupertino
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.380]   or surroundings, and they're gonna make an exception,
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.740]   and that's gonna keep happening until they have
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.820]   some dispersed groups, regardless.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.500]   But it's wasteful for a lot of those groups
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.660]   to put all that time and effort and money
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.300]   into being present for something
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.300]   that is really an online collaboration remote job anyway.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.500]   - And we, there's a lot of pretty important people
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.880]   that left when Apple did the first pass at this.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.220]   These were product managers, these were engineering managers
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.700]   that were like, I don't want to come back,
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.860]   and they, I live in Tahoe and I'm gonna stay here,
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:50.820]   kind of thing.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.340]   And the problem for Apple is that a lot of times
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.940]   the, or for all these companies,
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.260]   is that the golden handcuffs of getting all that stock
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.260]   eventually become golden wings.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.340]   And they don't really need to be here anymore.
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.900]   Like they, you know, it's nice to keep on getting
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.340]   that's those stock options, but they've been getting
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.420]   that for 20 years and they have enough to live on, you know,
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.340]   and they can start making, you know, wider decisions.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.540]   And I think that it is really, you know,
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.100]   there was a, there was a product, not at Apple,
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.180]   somewhere else, that there were two people
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.660]   that could have been product managers for it,
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.460]   and one person would have taken it one direction,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.580]   another person would have basically cut it to the bone,
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.500]   and the person who got a job cut that product to the bone,
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.620]   and that product was, yeah, Google Hangouts.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:37.260]   So, and boy, did they miss out a couple years ago
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.780]   when the COVID hit, you know, and the,
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.100]   and it was just a decision by one person.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.540]   So when you have, like, when you start changing one person
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.500]   out, you know, and that's gonna now run the idea behind that,
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.500]   it is, it can change the entire trajectory of a product line.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.460]   - It says corporate employees, I'm not sure what that means.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.580]   - We're retail is different, right?
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.660]   - Okay, you don't, you don't have to go to Cupertino
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.500]   if you work at-
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.100]   - So somebody who's in the Apple campus.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:08.940]   - Yeah.
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:09.940]   - And they have some contractors too,
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.340]   there are a bunch Apple still does,
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.500]   which I still find bizarre,
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.740]   but Apple still does work with contractors as well,
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.220]   where there are people who are doing support and other things,
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.260]   even things that are in, like, contractor in Sunnyvale.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.940]   I know somebody who's a contractor working 100% for Apple,
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.860]   but for a contracting company,
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.820]   and their offices are just across the street in Sunnyvale,
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.900]   but they're technically not an Apple employee,
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.740]   which is a game that you would expect a company like Apple,
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.460]   maybe not to play because they've got all the money,
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.300]   why are they doing that?
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.140]   But again, it's a corporate culture thing.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.020]   So this is all rolled in there, but I'll tell you,
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.780]   I mean, I ran a disparate, you know,
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.780]   a dispersed geographically office at Macworld,
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.660]   and bottom line was like,
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.460]   I wanted the best writers I could find,
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.180]   and if the best writer is in Massachusetts
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.580]   and we're in San Francisco,
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.940]   am I going to hire somebody worse?
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.300]   Because I want to look at them
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.940]   as they have their headphones on in the open office,
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.780]   writing stories instead of having them in our Slack
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.980]   or our campfire back in the day or whatever it was.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:07.820]   - 'Cause that's writers.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.620]   I mean, writing is very solitary.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.620]   - It is, but I mean, they have,
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.420]   like the App Store editorial group at Apple
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.420]   is basically a geographically dispersed group,
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.900]   and yet they really wanna hire people
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.740]   and have them sit in an office in Cooper D.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.580]   - That's silly.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.300]   - That's the challenge here is there's no way to do this,
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.420]   because there's always gonna be an exception that is like,
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.140]   but they have to be there to design the chips.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.340]   It's like, okay, that I totally get.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.700]   - Yeah, it has to be there, sure.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.140]   - Yeah, it's just, and this isn't just Apple,
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.980]   all these corporations have basically
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.700]   are trying to hide or run away from the idea
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.740]   that a lot of the arguments against remote work
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.940]   have been proven wrong.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.260]   And that's the interesting push and pull
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.300]   the next five or 10 years,
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.260]   is that a lot of people have realized that it's a lie.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.660]   And, you know, companies that get on that train
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.060]   and realize that they can get valuable people
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.420]   and maybe even save some money,
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.780]   but get valuable people and pay them remotely
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.580]   and not have real estate in a downtown somewhere
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.340]   that makes them feel good about their company,
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.460]   but doesn't actually do anything.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.780]   They're gonna get people who are more talented,
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.380]   who wanna work remotely,
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.540]   and they will benefit.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.220]   - Here are companies, just examples of companies
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.260]   that are permanent remote work, like for anybody.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.180]   3M, Airbnb, Atlassian.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.220]   I'm skipping some of them,
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.980]   I don't know, of Coinbase, well, they're probably
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.060]   as anybody that's ever listed.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.500]   - And I think the drop in box, HubSpot,
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.500]   log me in, Lyft, Meta, Octa, Quora, Twitter, Reddit.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.740]   I mean, shall we get into one?
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.580]   - Well, and if you want to drop box
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.380]   and move back to North Carolina for the Bay Area,
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.220]   it's so cool.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.060]   - And I thought the drop box took
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.300]   one of the most interesting ways of doing it,
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.180]   and say, hey, the offices are here.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.740]   We've got services at the offices,
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.580]   we've got the little micro kitchens
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.780]   and places for you to have conference calls
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.620]   and so on and so forth.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.940]   If you need somewhere to go, come on in.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.900]   You know, we're happy to have you.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.300]   - They're calling it drop box studios.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.300]   - Yeah, I thought it was great.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.620]   - That's such a really, like, that's the future.
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.580]   - Fresh baked cookies in the lobby
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.100]   and people will come.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.220]   - Well, there's also, there are people
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.460]   who live in a small house.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.300]   - Right.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.540]   - Who live in a busy house.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.380]   - That's the point.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.220]   - Who live in a busy house.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.060]   - It varies.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:11.900]   - And we have somewhere for them to go.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.140]   - Some people like to be around other people.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:15.980]   - For sure.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.820]   - Some people don't.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.100]   I think in the tech sphere,
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.980]   there is a preponderance of introverts
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.340]   and people who, if you're coding or writing,
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.420]   you probably do want it.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.780]   I know we had an open office in the last studio.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:28.980]   Everybody hated it.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.300]   (laughs)
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.700]   - And if you liked to try and phone song.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.980]   - I thought it was a great idea,
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.420]   but they did not like it.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.420]   - So.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.940]   - Yeah, we see the kind of preponderance of,
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.580]   it seems like in a lot of places,
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.100]   there's like, this is a big generalization,
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.180]   but it just seems like there's,
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.500]   things get broken up into thirds,
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.260]   which is that you have a third of the people
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.780]   that are extroverts, extroverts, and an average.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.220]   Third of you, but kind of in the middle,
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.580]   and a third of the people that would,
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.340]   are introverts and would prefer to stay away.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.380]   And you see that number of keep on showing up.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.860]   Like a third of the employees don't want to show up,
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.220]   a third of students don't want to show up,
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.700]   a third of, you know, like it's in that third range
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.540]   of people that just don't want to play.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.300]   - People are different, right?
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.060]   - Right, it's normal.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.580]   But here's what has changed, the balance of power.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.060]   And you're seeing it all over the work sector.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.500]   Suddenly, employees have so much more power
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.220]   than they used to, and they're standing up for their rights,
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.700]   and they're saying, I am not coming back.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.940]   The argument is, enjoy it while it lasts.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.260]   So the thing is, is that it is--
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.900]   - You think it's gonna shift back?
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.980]   - Well, here's the problem is, once companies get really good,
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.820]   I've been doing global productions for years
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.020]   for a decade or more than a decade.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.100]   At first, you're really excited about it,
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.180]   and it's hard, and you've got to figure all this stuff out.
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.380]   But when you get good at it,
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.820]   you now no longer think about,
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.700]   I need to find someone local for anything.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.540]   - Right.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.940]   - And it moves past, like the person who does
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.340]   most of my post work for audio is in the Philippines.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.540]   Not because he's less expensive,
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.020]   because he's the best I can find.
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.340]   Like he's really good at what he does, and he's super--
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.180]   - Right.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.460]   - And his company does that, and I send stuff down to Mickey
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.940]   to manage those things,
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.540]   and he's incredibly intelligent,
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.380]   and just knows what I need him to do,
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.740]   and just gets it done, and does it better
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.420]   than I can even imagine doing it.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.980]   Now, but I'm no longer constrained by thinking
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.380]   I had to find a audio engineer in San Francisco.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.500]   You know, like that doesn't occur for me,
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.180]   you know, and in the same sense that
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.580]   there are a lot of great people
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.340]   who are really good at what they do all over the world,
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.780]   and we're not really tapping into that right now.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.340]   You know, we're still sending people,
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.820]   and we're still trying to find people in the US,
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.460]   and still trying to find people here,
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.380]   but eventually as the companies get better,
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.260]   at first the companies are still in this growing phase
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.580]   where they can't figure it all out,
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.940]   and how do we transfer all this stuff,
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.260]   and how do we keep the company cultured,
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.740]   but they'll get good at it.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.340]   And once they get good at it,
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.580]   every continent, every person, as especially as you have things
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.100]   like Starlink and everything else,
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.460]   you're gonna get to a point where you're hiring people,
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.460]   and the thought of where they are.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.900]   - You were doing training in Rwanda, things like that.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.300]   - We were doing, we were building global communities
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.580]   doing this for almost 20 years now,
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.980]   and so it is, but what happens is it's swing,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.020]   it starts to swing the other direction to some degree.
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.180]   Now the people who are really good at what they do,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.780]   what's great for them is that they get to live anywhere
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.500]   they want, they're gonna make a good living,
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.580]   they're gonna definitely make a good living
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.420]   for where they're living,
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.220]   because they can make that decision, right?
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.300]   So it's really good for them,
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.700]   it's really good for companies who are looking for those folks,
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.060]   where we have to kind of look at the dystopian side of this,
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.020]   is there's a lot of people in the middle,
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.980]   and a lot of people below the middle
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.180]   that this becomes really unforgiving.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.020]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.980]   - Because it's just that you're not really in that,
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.300]   what we're seeing is a lot of people saying,
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.580]   "Oh, I don't wanna do this because they can choose,
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.820]   "but there's people who can't choose,
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.980]   "and for them this will get much harder."
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.260]   - We tell high school kids and college kids now a lot,
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.900]   skill up because the burger flipping jobs are limited,
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.540]   and somebody who can design a website or write code
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.540]   is gonna have much better prospects.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.280]   I also have to say,
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:04.340]   I suspect some of this comes back to Tim Cook
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.420]   standing on his big balcony at the Apple campus
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.260]   and looking out over his fields of service.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.540]   - And billions of dollars on that, yeah.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.540]   - A billion, and it's empty,
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.180]   and it must hurt his heart a little bit.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.140]   And I think some of it has got to be that.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.380]   - Maybe, maybe, I just think, again,
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.780]   I think that they'd have a lot of people clamoring
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.340]   to come back if they got rid of the open office.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.820]   So if they close-- - Yeah, that really--
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.700]   - If they had, they said we're gonna have a lower--
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.340]   - That was John the last big mistake, yes.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.140]   - But they could not redesign the outside,
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.980]   but redesign the inside so that everyone has
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.340]   little offices and has a little bit more space.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.500]   Now you'd have a bunch of people who,
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.740]   'cause man, I would never wanna work in an open office.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.300]   Like, I just couldn't, I can't think, like I can't.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.940]   And I've been in it, I've been, you know,
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.020]   I've been in our contractors earlier.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.820]   I've been read back-- - Also executives have offices.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.420]   Executives have the priority of like the work that they do.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:55.660]   They're in meetings with people
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.380]   where they need to be in meetings, right?
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.580]   That's part of the challenges here is a lot of the executives
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.700]   don't have an understanding of what that level,
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.220]   eight levels down that is just doing this job.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.260]   They're thinking of, we're at Apple Park,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.900]   and we're interacting, and isn't it great?
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.900]   And we go to Cafe Max, and I see my people,
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.740]   and we all talk.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.860]   And it's like, yeah, what about the person who's over the,
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.060]   on the other side of the freeway,
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.660]   in the old office building that's been there since the 80s,
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.500]   and they're in a little team that doesn't do anything,
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.100]   but go into cubicles and sit there looking
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.220]   at their screen all day, and they don't need to be there.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.500]   And something that came up that I wanted to hammer on,
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.580]   just for a moment is the idea that people,
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.980]   some people don't wanna work at home.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.100]   That's so true.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.420]   And I would argue that most companies can make this,
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.300]   what they save on real estate,
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.420]   they can put into things like a reimbursement
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.500]   for their employees, so that if they wanna work
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.740]   at a co-working facility, or if they wanna upgrade
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.220]   something in their house, that they have those options too.
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.500]   They don't, we always have a fitness reimbursement,
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.340]   and all sorts of stuff.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.100]   It's like, do a work from home reimbursement,
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.740]   that is also a co-working facility, or toward rent,
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.940]   in a, I had a co-worker who rented a single office
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.020]   in a law firm space, 'cause they had extra offices for rent.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.060]   And like, there are other ways to do that,
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.260]   to get, for people who can't work at home,
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.660]   or prefer not to.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.340]   And I think that that's all good.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.660]   And then the other thing you put your money to,
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.700]   is off-sights, right?
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.140]   You put your money to a once a quarter,
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.420]   or three times a year, or every other,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.140]   whatever the frequency, get your team together in person,
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.260]   a couple times a year.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.220]   And I think there's, and you're still ahead,
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.780]   in terms of your real estate as a company.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.100]   So I think companies are foolish to do this,
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.020]   but companies sometimes.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.580]   - And I think also that they could,
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.860]   you could just make it more fun to come in.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.180]   Like, get rid of the open offices,
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.500]   like Apple doesn't serve free food, you know, the other one.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.100]   I mean, I think I'm a small people.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.780]   - They don't serve free food.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.580]   The cafe, oh, that's right, Steve Jobs, you stepped in.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.780]   - Pay for it.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.100]   - Yeah, but yeah, but the,
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.860]   but other companies, I know people who,
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.060]   that's like a big thing for them.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.540]   I can always like, working to add this information company,
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.260]   I'm just kind of surprised that free food
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.100]   is a big deal for them.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.420]   - I'm sure companies will adjust.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.220]   - Yeah, so, but I think making it great,
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.860]   and especially, you know, making it great
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.140]   for the employees that do come in,
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.060]   because you have less of them coming in,
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.420]   is, might be a way to incentivize them also too.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.980]   Again, there are probably 25% or 30%
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.740]   that will unless you force them to, they will never come in.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.140]   But it's the other, that middle third,
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.180]   like, can you make it really advantageous
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.900]   for them to want to come in?
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.940]   - Yeah.
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.700]   Well, there's also going to always be that middle third,
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.940]   however you choose to describe the demographic,
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.340]   that pretty much have to put up
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.260]   with whatever management wants to inflict upon them.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.900]   And I think that part of this is really going to be,
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.140]   well, great, we're, we're,
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.700]   we're gonna allow you to work from home,
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.180]   and we're gonna be cutting your salary by $20,000,
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.260]   because we know that you no longer have to buy real estate
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.060]   or rent in the area.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.460]   - I know companies do, yeah, but I find that offensive.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.660]   - And there's, I mean, we're not talking specifically
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.300]   about Apple here, we're talking about, like,
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.220]   all tech companies and really all employers,
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.020]   and how this movement is going to affect things
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:08.860]   in the long run.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.620]   Once corporations understand that this is part
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.220]   of the expectations of the workforce,
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.620]   that there's going to be some sort of a flexibility in time,
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.700]   they're gonna figure out a way to nickel and dime
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.820]   the workforce out of whatever benefits
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.100]   that they're gonna want to have.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.100]   Like these people, like these people, like these people.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.060]   - Yes, except for competition.
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.380]   Go ahead, Andy, I just, I thought we have a little delay here,
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.540]   but I was just gonna say, they do have to compete
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:33.780]   for those workers with other people,
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.420]   and that's the only hope, I think,
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.700]   'cause I don't think you're wrong,
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.740]   I just think that that is, especially for these tech companies
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.060]   and tech workers, the problem with nickel and dime
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.900]   and everybody, if you're Google, is that Apple
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:49.060]   or Facebook or somebody is there to give you a better offer.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.180]   And so if you say, well, you moved to upstate New York
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:52.980]   and we're gonna cut your salary by $20,000,
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:54.900]   well, if you get another offer,
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.140]   then that's the only way to fight against that,
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:58.340]   but I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.540]   - Let's say hello to me, though.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.660]   - And I think the damage that it does for the employer,
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.860]   really, is that I have a bunch of friends that all left,
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.220]   that all left the Bay Area, I'm like, I don't know,
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.020]   I mean, literally 20 or 30 friends that just went,
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.780]   whoo, they're gone, and they went to Hawaii,
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.300]   and they went to back east, and they went to the mid,
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.140]   yeah.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.100]   - I almost went to all these at bar places.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.940]   - Lisa and I came--
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.420]   - This close.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.140]   - Exactly, and so they all dispersed,
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.180]   and when they were told, you can stay where you're at,
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.260]   but we're gonna do a cost of living adjustment,
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.300]   they didn't quit immediately,
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.900]   but they all prepped their LinkedIn,
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.660]   and they all started replying.
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.020]   The problem really is, is that the mentality of a person
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.260]   who's applying to other jobs all the time,
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.900]   not ready to leave any time soon,
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.500]   is that they're not really engaged with your company either,
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.220]   and so they're not working the way they used to work for you,
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.780]   and they're always just thinking about,
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.340]   and every meeting that they have with an external partner
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.460]   is a potential person that they might talk to about,
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.420]   hey, what's going on there?
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.660]   And just knowing about it,
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.100]   and so I think that those are the,
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.420]   that's the danger for companies,
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.180]   is when they start nickel and diamond people, as we said,
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.420]   that you have people who are become a lot more fluid
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.140]   about their relationship to the company.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.740]   - Yeah, okay, but imagine that segment of the workforce
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.180]   for which taking off to Barbados is not an option,
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.820]   that they've got to take care of elderly parents who are sick,
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.100]   they've got to take care of children's special needs,
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.100]   they're having problems just getting by day to day,
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.020]   those are the most vulnerable people,
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.540]   and the corporations know about that.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.420]   It's not, and a lot of the work is--
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.620]   - Well, that's when these offices--
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.580]   - Getting on the desk and saying union now.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.420]   - Right, but then say a lot of the work in offices,
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.900]   since time of memorial has not been the visionary person
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.100]   who figures out how to make AC current work
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.500]   and is indispensable and--
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.860]   - You're right, they have all nerve-of-the-hour, yeah.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.060]   - It's the people who are, as part of running this office,
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.300]   we need someone to hand copy this correspondence
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.940]   that's been done in long hand,
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.540]   'cause it's 1880 something,
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.100]   and the Xerox machine doesn't exist,
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.740]   even letter X doesn't exist until then.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.660]   And these are still the people who are, again,
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.460]   writing Python scripts has a skill set
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.980]   that is very important, but is also very, very much
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.140]   in the market, if you wanna find someone who,
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.940]   you can get some of the master's degree
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.420]   who can do high school level scripting jobs
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.140]   and admin jobs, and so these are the people
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.740]   that are gonna say, well, I really don't want,
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.900]   I really don't want to have to install the software
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.300]   on my personal phone so that you can basically make sure
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.940]   that I'm actually responding to service texts
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.220]   in a span of time and that you're docking my pay,
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.980]   you're making my pay contingent upon my hitting
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.860]   certain metrics of performance, but again,
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.140]   I've got a sick mother, I've gotta take care of her,
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.260]   I've got three kids that aren't gonna be going off
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.060]   to college for four or five years,
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.300]   I gotta take care of them.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:54.300]   So it really is, as Jason said,
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.940]   different people have different situations
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:01.060]   of different circumstances, and so we always have
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.900]   to be very, very assured that as always
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.060]   that this technology and this movement is not gonna be
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.020]   turned from something that frees people up
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.140]   to give people more freedom in their life,
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.580]   more choices in their life, more flexibility in their life,
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.500]   more power to get the work that they're being paid to do
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.980]   and do that work better and with better work-life balance
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.980]   and make sure that that tilts all the way
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.300]   in the side of the employer to make sure that
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.620]   this is gonna be great, this employee that we used to have
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.220]   as a contract employee paying $90,000 a year to,
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.740]   now we can figure out a way to pay
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.700]   or only 53,000 a year and not give many benefits.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.580]   This is awesome, we love, Viva La Revolution says this,
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.780]   this is the billionaire owner of the company.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.540]   - I guess really what's happening here is
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.060]   it's really a trend story and it's not just Apple
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:49.900]   and it's-
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.740]   - Yeah.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.740]   - Is employees are not willing to march in lockstep anymore
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.780]   and they're not all the same and they're not cookie cutters
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.780]   and the environments can't be cookie cutters
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.060]   and some companies are adjusting better than others to this.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.780]   - Well and again, I think that it's,
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:11.300]   it is a definitely a moving target.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.100]   Like right now you wanna take advantage of,
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.940]   you know the fact that you're a rare thing
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.420]   but if you also for the employees who do like working
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.580]   at home and then slow down because you know
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.340]   they have other things to work on and they have other things
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.180]   to do and there's the house and the thing and the thing
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:33.620]   that you know it will be, if you're in the West
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.780]   you have to keep getting better at what you do, like period.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.140]   Like you're not, you don't get to like-
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.740]   - It's a rare race, that's for sure.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.460]   - And so you just need to know that especially
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.380]   if you're on the coasts that there is a,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:50.180]   there is a moving, you know you have to stay current
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.460]   with a lot of those things because you are first competing
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.780]   with other people in the country, other people in the state
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.580]   but eventually you're gonna, you really will end up
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.820]   competing with the rest of the world
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:01.500]   and their cost of living is, you know,
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.540]   I've always, I've often told my wife, I was like,
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.460]   if we just moved to Rwanda, which is where I would move
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.740]   left to my own devices, I was like I could-
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.820]   - You can live like King.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.420]   - I could do office hours in the morning and that'd be it.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.260]   - Yeah, it'd be it.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.420]   - I could not go hang out, you know, like absolutely.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.260]   - You know, like work a couple hours a day
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.300]   and that would be, you know, then I'd go work on the garden
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.740]   or whatever. - As the start market crashes
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:25.620]   I start my expectation of where I'll retire goes down.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.740]   (laughing)
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.900]   Then the list and you know what, I could do very,
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.500]   I could live very well in, you know, in Mexico
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.500]   on this amount of money and then, you know.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.380]   - But I could easily find a job, but you know,
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.540]   like for instance, you know, living in Rwanda and Marin,
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.180]   you know, I think a lot about salaries and process
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.180]   and things. - Yep, yep.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.740]   - And big for the- - Same, same, same.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.940]   - Yeah, same, we're both in Marin, you're like,
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.740]   you're like, hey, I gotta get up in the morning
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.180]   and get some stuff done and move things forward
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.420]   because you know, I have a mortgage debate.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.780]   - 20 years ago.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.980]   - When we moved from San Francisco 'cause Abby was
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.220]   a little baby and we were told, you know,
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.340]   we were gonna move north, we just drove through Marin.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.780]   We didn't even stop, we just went right through Marin,
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.460]   kept going to Sonoma County where it was.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.580]   - It's not so much so.
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.420]   - Yeah.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.580]   - But was a little bit less expensive 20 years ago.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:12.900]   - Yeah.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.100]   - It's always like when I get asked,
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.020]   why am I working on the weekend?
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.540]   I'm like, 'cause I like the house.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.740]   - I like the living here.
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.900]   - It's like living here.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.740]   - Yeah.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.580]   - It's like living here.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.420]   - Things seem to get done, yeah.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.260]   - Exactly.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.100]   - All right, we'll watch and see with interest,
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.500]   what happens, at least Apple's not saying five days a week,
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.660]   right there, only saying three, you still can have two days
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.500]   at home.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.340]   Maybe that's the-
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.180]   - That's the driver's- - They feel like that's the
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.100]   compromise.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:33.980]   - That drive is brutal.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.180]   - It's always, no matter where you're coming from,
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.020]   that's a horrible-
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.700]   - This policy will, even though it's not completely
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.420]   work from home, this policy will help extreme commuters
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.460]   and for people who don't know, there are a lot
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.500]   of extreme commuters because when you get out
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.300]   of the blast radius of the South Bay, you can find things
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.100]   that are more affordable, not super affordable in terms
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.700]   of the rest of the country or world, but more affordable
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:58.220]   in terms of Bay Area and sort of like Greater Bay Area.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.620]   And so a lot of people, like we used to have,
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.180]   in my office in Dendenz, I'm just gonna,
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.380]   we had a guy who lived in Modesto, which is,
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.500]   I mean, it's far folks, it's far and lots of traffic.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.980]   And he would come in a couple of days a week.
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:13.780]   And so like this reduced schedule will actually help
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.660]   those people who have the terrible commutes,
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.580]   a save several hours a week out of their lives.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.860]   So it's again, not as good as it was,
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.420]   but better than coming in five days a week.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.420]   - And a lot of them are, a lot of them have apartments
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:29.020]   somewhere in that area that are just one really bad,
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.780]   like one room studios that they stay in for the weekdays
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.260]   and Tuesday through Thursday.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.860]   But a Tuesday through Thursday experience
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.460]   where you go down, you're there doing your thing.
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.980]   And then now I think a lot of them though,
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.740]   will be like on Friday, they'll be there for the meetings.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.780]   Like, you know, after having to come in,
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.100]   that's the problem you really have is that
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.340]   it'll come in for three days a week,
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.580]   but they'll be for those who are forced to
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.500]   and are bitter about it, you know, Monday and Friday
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.300]   may not be very, may not get as much done.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.180]   - But that's why housing prices up here went up
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.820]   because yes, it's an hour in San Francisco,
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.900]   but it's at least an hour from San Francisco.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.220]   And then now people are going to Mendesino,
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.460]   going farther and farther up north.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.820]   And I, you know, I remember having a two hour commute,
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.780]   but in traffic back in front of my brother's in general.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.940]   It's awful, awful.
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.980]   We have employees, frankly, we had,
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.340]   and it always makes me nervous when we hire somebody
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.620]   who's got a two hour commute.
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.020]   It's like, do you really want to come to the office?
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.980]   And it puts pressure on us to say,
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.860]   yeah, take a few days a week.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.980]   We're now a four day work week.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.380]   If, even if you had to come in,
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.260]   you'd only come in four days.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.100]   And because the commute everywhere is terrible nowadays,
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.740]   it's just awful.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.100]   All right, let's take a little break, come back.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.180]   There are other stories.
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.100]   There's not a lot.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:45.180]   I confess we're filling time here.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.300]   (laughing)
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.460]   I do, I am curious when we,
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.340]   get your predictions ready,
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:55.500]   get your prognostications prepared,
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.740]   you peerless prognosticators.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.660]   When is Apple's event going to be?
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.060]   We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.620]   Just a little bit, but first a word from ITProTV.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:06.460]   Love these guys.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.900]   When they started, what is it got?
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.700]   It's been like now nine years, almost a decade.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.620]   Tim and Don and the team there, they were so great.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.180]   Remember, Lisa and I a few years ago
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.860]   went out to celebrate the opening of their new studios?
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.780]   They have now, I think really,
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.140]   they have done so well.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.180]   Seven studios open all day Monday through Friday.
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.020]   What do they do?
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.460]   They teach people IT,
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.380]   and they do it better than anybody.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.700]   And they do it in a way you're gonna love
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.620]   because you can watch it on your TV,
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:39.380]   you can watch it on your computer, your phone,
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.140]   you can watch it on Apple TV.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:46.580]   It's a great way to get the IT training you need
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.580]   to either get into IT to advance your career,
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.700]   or, and we always talk about individuals,
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.940]   I really should mention,
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.660]   it's also great for businesses that have IT teams,
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:59.380]   they wanna upskill, or just keep them excited
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.260]   about the field.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.060]   ITProTV is a great way for you as a business
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.520]   to support your IT team.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.980]   It's a great benefit, you can give the IT team,
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.460]   but you get the benefit because they're better at security,
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.700]   they're better at networking,
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:14.100]   they're better at desktop support
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.300]   because they take these classes at ITProTV.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.580]   And you're not giving them something they won't use.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.540]   More than 80% of users who start a video
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.100]   at ITProTV finish it because it's engaging.
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.100]   They call them edutainers,
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.900]   they're trainers at ITProTV,
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.860]   or of course, first and foremost, experts in the field.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.460]   But then they also choose them
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.340]   because they're so fun, they're engaged.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.660]   And I think it comes from a passion for the field,
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.140]   a passion for what they're teaching,
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:43.820]   that communicates to your employees, to your IT team.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.260]   And that passion is exactly what you want from them.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:52.060]   Bingeworthy, entertaining, high quality content.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.300]   In every area, all your certs,
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.460]   all your training in one place,
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.460]   they've got every vendor and skill you'd need
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.700]   for IT team training, including Microsoft IT,
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.700]   Cisco, Linux, Apple, Security, Cloud.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.140]   That library is always up to date.
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.020]   That's why they have all those studios.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.260]   More than 5,800 hours on demand,
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.020]   ranging from pure technical skills,
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.940]   compliance issues, they're soft skills too,
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.380]   like marketing, running a business.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.820]   So really everybody can benefit from ITProTV.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:26.060]   Plus, you'll like the dashboard for the business plan,
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.700]   you can completely track what's going on,
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.020]   manage your seats, assign team members,
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.740]   unassign them, even create subsets of users.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.460]   So you can say, you three, you need to learn this.
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.380]   You can even assign single episodes
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.100]   as well as the entire course.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.900]   Episodes are 20 to 30 minutes long.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.740]   You get metrics like logins, viewing time,
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.220]   tracks completed and more.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:49.700]   I think it's just a fantastic way to keep your team
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.660]   engaged, skilled, to give them new skills.
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.060]   And of course, as an individual,
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.180]   it's a great way to learn.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.620]   Give your IT team the development platform
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.180]   they need to level up their skills
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.460]   and enjoy it at the same time.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.620]   And a team can be anything from two members
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:07.580]   to a thousand members volume discount, started five seats.
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.100]   Go to, so it doesn't have to be a giant team,
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:12.220]   go to itpro.tv/macbreak.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:15.100]   The offer code Macbreak30, you'll get you 30% off.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.900]   Mention that to your account executive at itproTV.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.260]   Itpro.tv/macbreak.
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.260]   And by the way, that offer code applies to individuals too.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.620]   So remember that when you go there.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.100]   Itpro.tv/macbreak, Macbreak30.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.780]   For individuals, it's 30% off.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:32.180]   Do me a favor.
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:35.180]   Go to itpro.tv/macbreak and check it out.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.220]   At least check it out.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.660]   I think you'll be very impressed with what they put together.
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.940]   And we thank them so much for supporting everything we do here
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.700]   to including Macbreak Weekly.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.180]   Support us as a Macbreak Weekly viewer or listener
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:50.180]   by using that address itpro.tv/macbreak.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:55.420]   It's the fun time of year, Defcon and Black Hat.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.300]   So of course, Exploit City.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.420]   You saw the guy, I love this, put a special agricultural
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.900]   version of doom on a John Deere tractor.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.700]   That is, that's the way to go.
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.300]   Why not farm simulator for heaven's sake?
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.500]   You missed it.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.460]   Well, you apparently, I didn't see it.
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:14.300]   You tried to escape.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.140]   But you did escape.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.980]   You apparently, you're farming corn in doom.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.780]   So it is kind of like, anyway.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.340]   That was an amazing crack.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:26.020]   I'm sure we'll talk about it on security now this week.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.580]   One of the things he fat out by the way.
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:28.420]   One of the other things.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.700]   It's very important because of course, farmers hate it.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.180]   The John Deere locks everything down.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.260]   You really don't own your combine or your tractor.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.660]   John Deere completely controls it.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.100]   And it turns out they're running an antiquated version
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:45.100]   of Linux, not, you know, GPL, but they're not honoring the GPL.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.380]   And we'll go get this.
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.300]   Windows C.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.300]   Windows C.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.740]   (laughing)
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.460]   The failed Windows mobile operating system from--
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.540]   Oh my God.
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.980]   Oh God, is that from the Bush era?
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.340]   Or is it all the way back to Clinton?
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.180]   I forget.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.500]   It's old.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.060]   I had a CE went way back well before the iPhone.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:10.060]   So I think it probably is George H.W.
[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:10.940]   Wow.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:11.780]   Wow.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.580]   Anyway, that's another story for another day.
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.340]   There is-- Another day.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:19.340]   There is definitely some Mac stuff to a single flaw.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.140]   Broke every layer of security in Mac OS.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:25.020]   This is the article from Matt Bridges and Wired.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:28.060]   It's an injection flaw.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.100]   Fortunately, Apple-- we should say right up front,
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.820]   patched this a long time ago.
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.460]   But it's now at Black Hat.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.780]   You can actually see the details.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.220]   Al Kommade, who is presenting the work this week in Vegas,
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.900]   found the vulnerability in December 2020, reported it to Apple.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:48.860]   He says he was paid a pretty nice reward for the research.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.300]   Apple issued at least two updates
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.380]   to fix it first in April of last year.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.180]   And again, in October of last year.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:02.700]   But it was kind of a nasty bug.
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.100]   Multiple steps to launching the attack.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:08.340]   But it all comes back to the initial process injection,
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.580]   then vulnerability, a process injection,
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.900]   as I'm sure Steve Gibson will explain.
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.100]   And if I were a better student, I would know.
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.980]   Allows hackers to inject code into a device and run code
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.780]   in a way that's different to what was originally intended.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:25.100]   I think he uses Xcode to do this.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.820]   It was a serialized object in the Save State system, which
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:29.620]   saves the apps and windows you have open.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.060]   You know when you shut down a Mac and it reopens those?
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.660]   That saved state system can run while a Mac is in use.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:39.100]   It's a process called AppNAP.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.580]   When an application is launched, it
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:45.180]   reads some files, tries to load them using an insecure version.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.660]   There's the word you're looking for.
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:51.380]   Of the serialized object, Alkamade
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:53.860]   said in all of Apple's operating systems,
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:57.260]   these serialized objects are used all over the place.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.660]   Often for inter-process exchange of data,
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.420]   the way the attack works is you can create those files.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.380]   At the place another application will load them from.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:09.820]   In other words, spoof the serialized object,
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.860]   replace it with a malicious one.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.060]   And then the problem is that the system just
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:18.580]   accepts it unchecked.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:26.580]   And so it is a flaw that can bypass system integrity protection.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.220]   Now I imagine all Apple had to do is say, oh yeah,
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.020]   we should probably check those as well.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.620]   Maybe we should make sure.
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:34.740]   But that was a bad one.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.780]   Again, fixed by Apple.
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.900]   Well, I think it was a couple, if I remember correctly,
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.020]   they had to patch it twice.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:39.780]   So it wasn't--
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:40.120]   Yes.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.380]   They patched it and then they patched it again.
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:42.300]   Yes.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.380]   But I don't think it was used in--
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.220]   I think he found it.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.340]   I don't think it was used in the wild, the panel of.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.940]   No, I think that's the case.
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.260]   Did you have to have access?
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.660]   I think you had to have access.
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.140]   Physical access to the machine.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.100]   Physical access to the computer, yeah.
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:54.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:59.060]   It doesn't look like they patched it twice.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.500]   It looks like they patched it for iOS
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.780]   and then they patched it for many of us.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.100]   Because it's a similar issue for both sides.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.220]   It's not clear how you would exploit this,
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.220]   but I'm guessing you could also put up, for instance,
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:15.780]   the malicious repository on GitHub and Xcode repository
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:16.780]   that did the same thing.
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:22.140]   So if you could get somebody to load your code somehow
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:26.500]   and that's social engineering, you
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.740]   don't have to be the one sitting at the keyboard.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:32.380]   Most exploits, somebody has to do it.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:32.860]   It's not--
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.740]   Right, this is they get a pirated piece of software
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.980]   or something like that doing this thing that
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:40.340]   is running an Xcode project and then you have to agree it all.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.220]   And they do a little helpful step-by-step of like,
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.220]   well, now click OK.
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:44.260]   Now put in your password.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:45.300]   Now click OK.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:45.940]   And then you end up with this.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:47.060]   Always be careful.
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:47.580]   Yes.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.940]   It's funny that they mention AppNet
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.020]   because I was under the impression that AppNet is not
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:54.780]   happening on Apple Silicon Max, but just on the Intel Max.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.820]   But there's another process because it's more like iOS.
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.660]   There's another process where it's staying awake.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.820]   It never really naps.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.580]   It's sort of always awake in a way that Max didn't used to be.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.780]   It's pretty technical.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:12.940]   But the blog post is at his website.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:16.620]   And you can actually-- now that Apple's patched it,
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:20.540]   by the way, praised Alcatman because he
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.740]   did what's called responsible disclosure and told Apple.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.820]   And Apple fixed it.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:30.260]   And then now six months later, he's telling people
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.940]   how you can do it.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.420]   And let's also be happy that Apple seems
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.260]   to be a little bit more agile in responding
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.380]   to developers who are security researchers who
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.300]   are providing these bug reports because they have not always
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.780]   been as grateful as they need to be.
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.380]   We've had multiple reports for the past two or three years.
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:52.580]   So someone who tried and tried and tried to get them
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.060]   to pay attention and act on a bug that they supported.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:54:00.100]   And either A, the patch keeps getting delayed, delayed, delayed.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.500]   And then when it actually gets happened,
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.260]   the security researcher doesn't get credit for the bug
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.540]   kill than not being the bug bounties.
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.180]   We're not nearly high enough commensurate
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.580]   with the amount of work that security researchers put
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.740]   into finding these things.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:16.260]   It really is you either pay--
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:16.740]   it really is.
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.780]   Do you want to pay $500 to the exterminator
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.260]   to get rid of the termites in your house?
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.740]   Or do you want to spend $20,000 later on
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.340]   to have the foundation replaced?
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:27.340]   It's an easy $500 to spend.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:32.420]   Pached in Mac OS 12.0.1 Monterey.
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:36.780]   So you're probably OK if you--
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.820]   And it is.
[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:40.500]   It's just great to see Apple stepping up and pay.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.740]   I mean, I know there are criticisms
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.980]   that they're still not necessarily doing it the way
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.260]   the security community would like,
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.740]   and maybe not paying them the amounts they would like.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.260]   And I mean, at what point are we tired of the story
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:53.820]   that Apple is doing a thing in a way that everybody else
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.060]   in the world doesn't like?
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:56.300]   That seems to just be Apple.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.140]   They're going to do it the way they think it's right.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:02.180]   But they have gotten on board with this idea that if somebody's--
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:05.660]   they're motivating people to find flaws and paying them
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:08.540]   for their work, and we're all safer as a result,
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.700]   and that's how it should be.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:15.860]   Another discovery from everybody's favorite Mac--
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:20.140]   good guy security researcher, Patrick Wardle, in Zoom.
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.740]   Oh, no.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.580]   Not again.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.620]   Oh, no.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:27.180]   Is Max Headroom going to appear in the middle of the show now
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.460]   and take over for us?
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.060]   I am wearing Max Headroom's blazer, maybe.
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.060]   Yeah, it could be.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.180]   If the Cass-Matt Fruer--
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:37.100]   like in the original, I'm fully on board with this.
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.340]   They are, by the way.
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.660]   Did you know Brandy Beck with Matt Fruer?
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.380]   Because only he can be Max Headroom,
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.980]   because he's got that square chin jaw.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:46.900]   And he can survive--
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.940]   Well, not as-- also the guy who wore a Max Headroom mask
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.780]   who took over a TV station in Chicago.
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:52.380]   I know that one.
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:54.020]   That was the reference I was trying for there.
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.780]   Either way, I mean, we're on an insecure line now.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.260]   Everybody just be aware where the line is insecure.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:02.860]   So there is an auto update feature in Zoom.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.380]   There he is.
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:04.500]   Hello.
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:04.860]   See?
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:05.420]   Max.
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:06.060]   That's me.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.540]   I need a black rubber tie, though.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.820]   Then I'd be set.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.940]   And a square jaw.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:15.220]   Zoom has an auto update feature.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.620]   This is sometimes a problem.
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.420]   You've been there.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:20.580]   You're going to a meeting, and Zoom says, oh, we got update.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:26.620]   And then you enter your system password.
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:30.020]   And the problem is you enter the system password
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.500]   once the first time when you set up the feature.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:37.420]   From then on, Zoom doesn't have to ask.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:40.980]   It has permanent permissions.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:46.180]   Patrick Wardell said, oh, he presented a DEF CON this past week.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.460]   Two vulnerabilities you found in the automatic update
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.860]   features-- validation check for the updates.
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.620]   For an attacker who has access-- this is a physical access
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:56.100]   attack-- the vulnerabilities could have been changed
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.980]   and exploited to grant the attacker total control
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:00.260]   of the victim's machine.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.300]   Zoom has fixed these vulnerabilities.
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.100]   Well, he fixed--
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:09.340]   OK, so he found another one, which he hasn't yet told Zoom
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:14.060]   about that reopens the attack vector.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.860]   Wardell told Wired ahead of his talk.
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:18.220]   I was curious about exactly how they were sitting this up.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:20.700]   But when I took a look, it seemed on first pass.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:21.820]   They were doing things securely.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:22.940]   They had the right ideas.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:26.540]   But when I looked closer, the quality of the code
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:27.780]   was more suspect.
[00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:30.740]   It appeared that no one was auditing it deep.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.540]   Lee, enough.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:33.740]   Oh.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:34.900]   Oh, the word.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.940]   That Zoom for you.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.660]   To automatic--
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:42.300]   I turn most automatic updates off.
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.500]   Maybe this is a good idea.
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.940]   Certainly one that only has a role.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.540]   The password once.
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.100]   Right.
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.620]   But in general, I just turn them off.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:51.580]   And I like to wait, typically, unless they have a feature
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:53.300]   that I really need at that moment,
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:55.180]   I like to wait a week or two and just like--
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.420]   That's a good point, too.
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.020]   To see how it sorts out.
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.340]   And now we'll jump into it.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.660]   Just because sometimes that goes out and they almost
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:02.860]   immediately find something, you'll
[00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.780]   see those like three-day security patch that comes out
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:06.380]   after something.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:09.260]   I like to just sit outside of that and let it sort it so far.
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:10.860]   There's really something new.
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.700]   There's really something I needed in the next two weeks.
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.140]   Actually, they have a slow and fast update channel now.
[00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.660]   So it's actually a nice feature that more people should
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:19.380]   probably have.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:22.180]   So if you're like Alex, you could turn on auto updates.
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.420]   So you are sure to get those security fixes.
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:26.140]   But if you're on the slow channel,
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.620]   it does mean that you're only getting it after it's
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:29.540]   sort of been out there.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.900]   And it's a version that they're happy with instead
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.300]   of getting the new update all the time.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.260]   And I like that as an idea of being
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.180]   able to choose to be on the faster slow path.
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.460]   More software should do that.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.460]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.140]   And another aspect of that is that when you have auto updates
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:47.860]   put in, it can destabilize your machine,
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.300]   even when you haven't restarted yet
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:51.580]   or haven't clicked to apply those patches.
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.460]   Because I find that there will be sort of a partial,
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:56.180]   like a pre-installed load.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:59.420]   And for some reason, some weird stuff
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.020]   is happening with my internet connection
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:03.020]   or some really weird stuff is happening
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:06.500]   with a Windows manager and getting things that are--
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:08.580]   Windows are taking a long time to redraw.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.380]   And then I dig myself out from under it.
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.660]   And I find that there is somewhere-- there's a dialog box
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.060]   saying, hey, I've just a system update,
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.300]   xxx has just been downloaded.
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:21.300]   Do you want to restart to affect these changes?
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:25.260]   And yeah, I would like to think that this system would say,
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.340]   I'm not going to do anything that's
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:28.220]   going to mess up your computer, Andy,
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.940]   especially because given that it's like 6.30 in the morning
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.940]   and someone is expecting this thing to be finished
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.740]   in the next hour and a half, yeah.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.940]   I do think that it's as important as it is
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.820]   to make sure that you have the latest versions of everything
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.700]   for security reasons, as for stability reasons.
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.580]   My system is a lot happier, and I'm a lot happier with--
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.380]   it's just alerting me and then letting me choose the time
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:52.180]   and the place when the disaster happens.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.420]   Zoom says it's important to update.
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.220]   We resolve these security issues.
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.140]   We recommend you keep up to date with the latest version
[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:58.940]   of Zoom.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.140]   Zoom offers automatic updates to help users stay on the latest
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:02.540]   version.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:06.260]   Wardle agrees, but he says the main reason I looked at this
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:09.820]   is because Zoom is running on my computer.
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.260]   The good news is, as of yesterday,
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:17.260]   at 2.10 PM Eastern time, Zoom has patched the second flaw
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.300]   he talked about at DEF CON.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.620]   So if you were interested in the details, Lillie Hay Newman
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.340]   has a very good write up on it and wired in which she describes
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:31.660]   the first flaw, a way to bypass the cryptographic signature
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:32.540]   check.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.580]   She says, imagine you carefully sign a legal document.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.180]   Then put the piece of paper faced down on a table.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.700]   Next to a birthday card, you sign more casually
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.220]   for your sister.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:44.020]   Zoom's signature check was essentially
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.420]   looking at everything on the table
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.660]   and said, oh, that birthday card signature's just fine.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.820]   Go ahead.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:54.820]   I don't know how apt that metaphor is, but it's good.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:56.740]   I get the idea.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.220]   That was the first flaw they then they found a second flaw.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.540]   So--
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:05.300]   And just as a statement, Zoom takes these things pretty seriously.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.620]   I mean, they obviously had some PR problems
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:07.540]   at the beginning of--
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.900]   Oh, and that's when they hired a bunch of very good people
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.500]   to tell you.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.180]   But I got to tell you, you turn all the dials up on Zoom
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.460]   into about as--
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.220]   there's always this balance between convenience.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.820]   I mean, a lot of times when things are made--
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.540]   when you have a mistake with security,
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.060]   it's because they're trying to make it more convenient
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.540]   for someone to install or whatever.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.060]   Because that's always the thing is like,
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.140]   we try to get someone to put a new version of Zoom on
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.060]   if we're going to have them do a remote.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.460]   They're like, why do I have to do this?
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.180]   And now I have to fill out all these things.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.940]   And that's what they're trying to get past.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.020]   And sometimes they don't get it right.
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.500]   But I think that it is--
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.300]   it's all of them are pretty secure at this point,
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:43.420]   because they're being used so much.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.060]   And they're under a lot more attacks than they were in the past.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.220]   And we haven't seen-- I don't know if anyone really used this one.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.940]   It's just something that we saw.
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.140]   I'm going to ask this, by the way.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.180]   You might as well get used to it every single Tuesday
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.860]   until it happens.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.260]   When's the Apple event coming?
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.500]   Well, I did it last week.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:06.980]   There was no general consensus.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.220]   I don't get invites, but I think they still mail them out
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.380]   a week ahead of time, right?
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.060]   So we won't know.
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.820]   Right now, it's a week.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.980]   If you're not doing it in person and it's just remote,
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.420]   they give you about a week's notice, which is not--
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.820]   I'd prefer more notice than that,
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:23.060]   but they don't care about that.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:25.420]   I'm going to guess the 13th is the most likely,
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.740]   because they like Tuesday events.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.620]   And Labor Day week is challenging,
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.940]   because then you're asking people to do it the day after Labor Day.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.100]   They have in the past also done them a day regressed,
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.980]   so you could do it on the seventh.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.860]   I think that's a possibility to--
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:44.180]   But if it's not in person, it doesn't matter for them.
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.500]   In a production world, if it's not in person,
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.660]   if you're not doing a stage event, it doesn't matter.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.620]   It is really expensive to do things
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.300]   on the day after Labor Day, because while the event is
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.100]   on the day after Labor Day, the production crew
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.980]   was there on double time on Monday and Sunday.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.780]   So there's a good reason why a lot of people
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.980]   do things on Tuesday is because it gives you one week
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.660]   day to get ready for the event, and it gives you
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.420]   otherwise the most amount of weekdays
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   to get press before it disappears into the following week.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.220]   So Tuesdays are generally a part of the game.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.980]   And the rumor mill says, and it's no surprise,
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:21.180]   that they have begun recording the features,
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.860]   which implies that it will not be all a requirement person.
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:27.340]   Didn't they do a hybrid thing last time where--
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.020]   I know Google did, where there were some people--
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:29.780]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.180]   At WWDC, there were some people at the Apple campus.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:35.700]   But I don't think anyone was at the in Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:36.780]   I think they were outside.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.620]   No, it was outside.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:38.420]   Big LED wall.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.940]   Yes, it's COVID thing.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.980]   But it would be nice to go back into the--
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.340]   I still think that they can just play a movie at the theater.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:48.260]   It'd be just as nice, rather than having people
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:49.100]   swanck on stage.
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.220]   I do think that the last one was a bit--
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.380]   the ones that I felt like peak keynote was December
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:58.620]   or whatever, and at the end of 2021
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.980]   was the best one we've seen ever.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.660]   And then it felt like they were trying
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.100]   to get ready to go back into the stage.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:08.540]   And it's gotten now slower and more full of blah
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:09.580]   than it had been before.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.140]   So I'm hoping that they just give up on it
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.020]   and just give us a good movie.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.220]   App has a lot of things they need to announce, by the way.
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:19.060]   So they're probably September and in October, as in the past.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.980]   And I've had an iPhone event, an AirPods event.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:22.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.860]   iPhone 14, the rumor is four models.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.020]   Two of them will have the A-15--
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.140]   now I'm all confused.
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.540]   Two of them will have last year's chip.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.940]   Two of them will have this year's chip.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.980]   There'll be two 6.7 versions and two,
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:40.340]   whatever, a little bit smaller versions.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.820]   I guess they would do the watch the same day.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:45.620]   Because it's an iPhone accessory.
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.620]   So it'd be the same time.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.660]   So a new Apple Watch 8 and then there's the rumors are
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:53.180]   there'll be two kind of models.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.020]   There'll be a pro version now that's
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:05:00.420]   out of it, be a titanium alloy and have some pro features,
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.100]   maybe additional athletic features.
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:06.940]   And the big new feature is it'll monitor your temperature.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:07.940]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.100]   It'll sense your temperature.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.180]   And kind of say maybe how--
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.660]   Don't tell it what your temperature is.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.660]   But it'll say--
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:17.340]   It's not a little.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.020]   It will say-- yeah.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.100]   It will basically be an image of a doctor, male, female,
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.380]   gender of your choice going.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:30.180]   Because temperature sensors aren't really accurate
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.660]   for wearables yet.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.860]   And also, they might be limited as to what the FCC will
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.900]   allow them to say their temperature sensor can actually
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.180]   provide as far as hope goes.
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:43.740]   Yeah, my Aura ring, which has had temperature sensing for a while,
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.180]   only shows you the trend.
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.420]   It says you're up half a degree, you're down half a degree.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.500]   But that's actually valuable.
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.980]   I started wearing it because of COVID
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.540]   to kind of give me an early alert that maybe I'm not doing
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:55.940]   so well.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.580]   Although I'm healthy now and I noticed
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.220]   it fluctuates quite a bit.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.740]   So I don't know if that's the ring or I would guess Apple's
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.980]   going to do a better job than--
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.540]   For me, it's always-- the watch really
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.700]   is one of those things that has to have something that--
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.700]   I don't feel like I need to update the watch very often.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.180]   Because of what I use the most out of the watch
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.700]   is the timer.
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.620]   Like the timer in the alarms.
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.340]   Like telling me, reminding me of something to do
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.540]   is the thing that's probably the most important piece
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.820]   of the watch.
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:25.260]   And so I don't--
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.460]   I find myself going, well, and I like the heartbeat
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.300]   and I like the things.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.460]   And I finally upgraded.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:32.260]   But I think I skipped two or three years before I
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.740]   upgraded again.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.900]   The phone, I usually--
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:35.900]   I've skipped a couple of years.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.460]   But I think the big thing for me is to see what they do.
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:41.420]   I mean, now I just watch what they're going to do with the camera.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.380]   The cameras have just really just
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.820]   feel like every year they get significantly better.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.460]   Like they really realize that what we really want
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.420]   is a camera that has some phone functions.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.580]   And they keep giving them to us.
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:50.940]   Good.
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:51.380]   Thank you.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.860]   I'll take it.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.500]   Reportedly, again, where there's all rumors,
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:59.460]   the front-facing camera will now have autofocus.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:02.300]   And the new back-facing camera, instead of 12 megapixels,
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.740]   is 48 megapixels.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.140]   But that's binning probably, right?
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.140]   Not native, certainly.
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.340]   My guess is, though, that it'll probably
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:12.060]   be a big leap in image quality.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:14.700]   And Apple doesn't do--
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.100]   Apple resisted going above 12 for a long time
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:21.420]   because Apple was focused more on the light being captured
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.300]   with pixels and the end image quality,
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.340]   because they have a very specific philosophy
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.700]   about building iPhone cameras.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.540]   So to go to 48, I'm sure they will talk about how they're
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.740]   doing binning.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.700]   Maybe only Apple could do it this way kind of thing.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.660]   But in the end, it's still, regardless,
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:38.580]   is probably going to be the biggest iPhone camera upgrade
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.620]   we've seen in a while, I would think.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.260]   Yeah, particularly for video.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.340]   If they decide to go for 8K video shooting,
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:49.140]   that would be a pretty damn interesting development
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:52.500]   for-- on a Samsung phone, you think that, OK, once again,
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.980]   they want to be the first to introduce a feature,
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.340]   even if it's a crap feature that no one wants to use.
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:00.580]   With when Apple-- if Apple were to do a higher than 4K
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:03.220]   resolution video capture, that would be something
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.180]   pretty amazing.
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.580]   Or even if they just use the extra pixels
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:10.780]   as slop around the 4K to do automatic tracking of--
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:14.460]   if you're holding the phone remotely stable
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:18.260]   to be able to do a virtual tracking shot that holds
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:22.060]   a subject in the middle like that.
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:25.260]   As I think of that, though, the next thing I think about
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:28.540]   is Apple is usually really stingy in terms
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:31.580]   of how much storage they give you for whatever buck
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.860]   you're willing to spend.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:36.260]   So are they willing to sell me a 64 gigabyte phone that
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:39.100]   shoots 8K video metaphorically speaking?
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:43.580]   Or is it going to be-- it shoots 8K video,
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.260]   but you're going to want to have the $1,500 top whack
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.140]   to terabyte storage model in order
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.540]   to actually use it effectively?
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:54.180]   There's president's for this because they didn't--
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.980]   the four, what is it, the raw?
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.940]   You could shoot raw.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.380]   And on the lower storage configuration,
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:02.620]   they basically said, you can't.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.980]   Sorry, you can't.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.580]   And they actually turned the feature off
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.420]   because they're like, there's no point.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.780]   There's not enough room for this.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:11.100]   I suspect we're at on the precipice,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.660]   and this might be the model where
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:15.860]   all of the different levels are raised up,
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:19.580]   where there's a two terabyte storage at the very top,
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.180]   where it might have been one before,
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.420]   and that there's rumors that there's
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.420]   going to be a price increase.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:26.500]   And one of the reports I think Ming-Chi Kuo made suggested
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:32.940]   that they expect a 10% to 15% increase in average selling
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.220]   price on the iPhone.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.260]   The only explanation for that--
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.580]   it can't be explained by mix by adding in that big low end
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.420]   phone and getting rid of the mini RIP mini.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:46.940]   But if that's the case, and they raise the price of every iPhone
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:50.220]   base model by $100, one scenario there
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:53.420]   is that what they do is they raise the base storage.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.420]   Because remember, all the base storage is, I think, $64.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.540]   And then it's $100 up to $128.
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:04.100]   So one scenario might be that they just lift all of the storage,
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.220]   start at $128, at least on the pro models,
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.060]   and then maybe add an enormous storage
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.860]   deer on the very top.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.140]   Because not only-- as Annie points out-- not only
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.620]   is that data that you could probably use,
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:22.580]   but it's a lot of margin for Apple and Apple likes that.
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:23.580]   Yeah.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:27.860]   They also just note that it's not an Apple-star orange comparison
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.740]   in defense of Apple in terms of what they charge for storage.
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.300]   Because Apple puts a real priority
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.460]   on the fastest possible data path.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.820]   So it's not just they're buying whatever commodity chips
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.660]   they can possibly find.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:42.500]   And just so long as they can get 512 gigs of storage on there,
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.020]   it works.
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:46.620]   It has to be 512 gigs of storage that can record video
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:49.300]   at the level of quality that they want to record at,
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.700]   indefinitely without any stutters, without any crashes,
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.700]   without any bounces or anything.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.500]   So there is that.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.020]   But it is annoying that if, like me, I don't just shoot--
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:02.300]   and I don't put a real high value on really great video
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.220]   recording, what I do want to be able to do
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.700]   is to be able to put as many comics on the phone,
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.700]   as many music files, as many video files, capture
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.780]   as many pictures as I want without having to run out of storage
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.700]   or have a performance slowdown because we're running out
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:15.460]   of storage.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.780]   And for that reason, I'd much rather have the cheaper RAM,
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:18.780]   but have more of it.
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.100]   It's too bad that you don't have really that option.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.580]   And I'd much rather see much higher frame rate
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.740]   than higher resolution.
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:29.060]   So if the 8K is great, but there's just nowhere to play it.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.580]   And so I think that--
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.500]   an Apple doesn't usually put stuff in that
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.500]   is way over top of somewhere to something to do with it.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.620]   And so 8K may be something that's there,
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:41.500]   but I think that higher frame rate 4K
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:46.460]   is probably would make more sense going to 240 or even 480.
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.100]   It's just so much fun.
[01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.500]   People love slow-mo.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.340]   So yeah.
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:53.540]   And the funny thing is that slow-mo is cool at 120,
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.740]   but when you get into the--
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.700]   we do a variety of stuff where you need slow-motion.
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.300]   At 480, it's pretty magical.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:04.780]   240 is really cool, but 480 and above--
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:07.940]   the 480 to 1,000 frames a second is a--
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:08.900]   it's just such a fun experience.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.820]   Because it has to be slow.
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:10.740]   You start doing all kinds of stuff.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.860]   Except for slow-mo, could you have high frame rate
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.860]   that was normal speed that just looks smooth?
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:15.500]   Well, like 120--
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.140]   I think that Apple's on its way to 120.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.060]   I mean, I think that everyone's on their way
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:20.620]   to 120.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.900]   Almost every camera you buy now, like, has one.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.340]   Like, they're starting to get 120.
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.020]   The Apple TV is capable of 120--
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.700]   the current Apple TV is capable of 120.
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.940]   All our TVs have been capable of 120 for a long time.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:34.220]   That really changes how something looks as much as 4K does,
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.380]   right?
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.460]   It's much more visceral, so it doesn't have the cinematic look.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.340]   So if you're looking for cinematic experience,
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:44.260]   but what I will say is that if you've ever seen any sports
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:45.860]   at 120, it's pretty--
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:46.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.900]   And the real thing that I think that--
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.460]   again, I still feel like this is going to fold into MLS
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:52.980]   in the next couple of years--
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:56.100]   is that MLS gives Apple--
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:59.980]   the soccer league gives Apple the ability to--
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.420]   the first year I bet you, it'll look like a regular TV show.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.260]   But I bet you behind the scenes, Apple
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:07.460]   is shooting 120 and looking at that and everything else.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.940]   And maybe the second year for the first year.
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.100]   By the end of the season, if the first year went well,
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:12.660]   we might see a couple shows that are--
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.860]   and all you have to do there--
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:16.300]   it's not like everybody has to see 120.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:20.500]   All you have to do is set the top ladder on the manifest
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:24.460]   to be there's a 120 version of this show that's being embedded
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:24.900]   into it.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.300]   And if you don't have the bandwidth for it,
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.780]   we'll just give you the 60-per-second.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.020]   It's not a big deal.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:31.660]   And if you set the-- it turns out that if you set the shutter
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.780]   speed to what we call 360 degrees at 120,
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:35.060]   it doesn't bother you.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.780]   And it means that the 60 looks fine.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:37.820]   So you could do the same--
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.580]   Say that again.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.220]   Same show.
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:40.660]   Shutter speed.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:43.180]   So shutter speed is-- so basically what we're used to looking
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.460]   at on TV is what we call 180-degree shutter, which
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:49.380]   means that the shutter speed is twice the speed of the frame
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:49.880]   rate.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.420]   So if you have a 24-frame per second,
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.620]   your shutter speed is 48.
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:55.460]   If you have 60 frames a second, your shutter speed is 120.
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.860]   I thought the shutter speed was determining the frame rate.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:01.180]   No, the shutter speed--
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.660]   Yeah, it's how the shutter--
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.780]   it's just how fast that shutter goes around.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:08.100]   And we've gotten used to motion blur that is from 100--
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:08.500]   So there's--
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:09.740]   It's half open.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:10.740]   It's open half the time.
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:11.580]   Not the whole time.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.340]   Yeah, I got to start.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.340]   OK.
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.140]   Erase.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:17.620]   So I understand there's a shutter and a still camera.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.420]   There's shutters and video cameras?
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.740]   Well, it's just how fast it exposes.
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:22.980]   There's no shutter now.
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.380]   So a video camera is really taking individual stills
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.060]   at a certain rate.
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.620]   Well, it's worse than that, because it's actually not.
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:31.780]   It's taking individual lines.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.300]   It's what we call a rolling shutter, which means that it's--
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.300]   so it takes--
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.780]   it's how fast it scans from the chip.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:40.260]   Yeah, it's not-- if you see a global shutter,
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.340]   it's taking it all at one time.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:44.060]   But if it's a--
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:48.140]   it's uncommon to have it be fast enough to grab the whole image.
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:49.780]   That would be very expensive.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.420]   It's expensive.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.820]   You don't put it in the cheaper camera.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.500]   So most of them are scanning it.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.860]   What we call a rolling shutter.
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:55.820]   And that's why if you're--
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.020]   And they're going to the top of the screen,
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.820]   100, 20 times-- or 30, 60, 120 times a second.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.740]   But what happens is, is it does that--
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:06.500]   if it's grabbing a frame, how long does it
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.620]   take to grab that frame?
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:10.820]   So if it holds it open and takes that frame over
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.860]   the entire frame rate.
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:15.100]   So if it's 24 frames a second and you have it--
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.180]   what we call a 360 shutter, which means that it's
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:22.660]   the effectiveness of the gate was opened for--
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:24.180]   except there is no gate in the frame.
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:25.300]   --the whole time the frame was being exposed.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.220]   But it's like that.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:26.740]   OK.
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:28.220]   So what we found is that if we do that,
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:29.340]   it feels a little dreamy.
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:31.580]   There's a lot of motion blur that happens in that.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.900]   If the frame is open for 24 frames.
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.180]   And so we keep it open.
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:39.140]   So you could have a high frame rate, but 24 frames, in effect.
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:39.620]   Well, no, no.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.580]   You have a high shutter.
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:42.340]   But time is open for 24 frames.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.740]   Yeah, so you can-- and then that looks really stuttery.
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.540]   So if you watch "Old World War II" stuff,
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.180]   that's a 90 degree.
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:50.380]   So that's one quarter of the time.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.540]   And you'll notice that "World War II" looks very--
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:54.700]   in fact, saving prior Ryan, they shot the whole thing
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:55.820]   on 90 degrees.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:56.420]   To give it that low.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:58.460]   To make it feel like "World War II" footage.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:02.300]   And so-- but you'll notice that it feels a little--
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:03.940]   what we call "framey" because there's
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.620]   not enough motion blur to tie the frames together.
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:10.380]   And so now what you have to do is every time--
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.860]   and the problem is is that as you start to increase that,
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.420]   you start to end up with less light.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:19.900]   Because if you treat 120 with 180 degree shutter,
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.580]   you end up at 1/240 of a second.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.260]   If you're a still frame, a still photographer,
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:25.060]   you know what that means.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:26.780]   That means there's not a lot of light there.
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:30.220]   And so what you do is you--
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.180]   what you can do is expose what we call 360, which
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:37.020]   is that the 120 frame per second is getting a hole.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.100]   And it works out-- I mean, for whatever reason, it works out OK.
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:43.220]   But it means the 60 is getting the shutter speed it expects.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.340]   And then to make this all more complicated
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:47.980]   is if you have LED lights or regular lights,
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.980]   they'll all flicker because your shutter is way faster
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:51.500]   than they are.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.100]   And so that's why even with slow motion,
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:58.140]   sometimes you see this of the lighting
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:01.740]   because you're taking five frames for every--
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.580]   but anyway, to go back to all of this stuff
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.140]   is I think that 120 is coming.
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:07.220]   And I think that Apple is uniquely
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:11.420]   prepared for that because they can turn that camera--
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:12.660]   the camera's already shooting 120.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:15.980]   They could deliver it to Apple TV or a lot of other devices
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:17.020]   at 120.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:18.380]   They also build content.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.260]   And now they're getting into sports.
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:24.740]   So they could go to 120 at any time, probably easier
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.860]   than almost anybody else out there.
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:28.740]   And what it does is it just means
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:32.220]   that I will say as someone who's worked in 120 in the past,
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:35.460]   that it's addicting.
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.980]   I wouldn't shoot a film that way because it's disorienting
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:38.540]   because it's--
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.700]   We expect real and different expectation.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.140]   Well, your brain also--
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:47.260]   there are certain things that your brain starts to look at it
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.660]   more closely to reality.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:50.980]   Now, some people say that outer edge is 480 degrees,
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.540]   but 480 frames a second.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.100]   But I think that there is a sizable difference
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:58.180]   about mid 90s, like 90 frames per second.
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.860]   Your brain starts to think about what it's looking at differently.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:01.460]   I agree.
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:04.340]   And if it fills your aperture-- so if you can't see anything
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.980]   about the video and you're at 120 frames per second at 8K,
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:08.820]   it's disorienting.
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:11.180]   You actually-- I've actually sat there looking at an LED wall
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.940]   that's 8K, 120 HDR.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:17.860]   And I literally, when they move the jib, my stomach pulled in.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.860]   Like I was like, oh, like that.
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:21.660]   Like my brain does not like that at all.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.020]   And so what happens, though, is that
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.980]   means that you can't shoot films the way you used to shoot them.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.260]   You can't-- it's not good for everything.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:33.780]   But what it is good for is capturing life around you.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.260]   It's good for sports.
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.180]   It's good for concerts.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.420]   It's good for-- turns out it's really good for some people
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.220]   for horror because it's really like you're there.
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.220]   Yeah.
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:44.300]   So there's a couple of things--
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.300]   I'm going to make your genres.
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:47.340]   But yeah, exactly.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:47.860]   Exactly.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:50.340]   And so there's a genre-- there's certain genres
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.860]   that 120 makes a lot of sense for.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.620]   And then filmmaking generally, it doesn't.
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.060]   Like it's better to be it.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.900]   And now the other interesting piece of this
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:02.620]   as we geek out is that 24 frames a second calculate
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.780]   is evenly divisible into 120.
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:06.380]   So you could actually--
[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:07.780]   there's some folks that for a couple of years
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.540]   and a couple of us have been playing with,
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.300]   is you can shoot 120 and then use optical flow to use
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.260]   the frames that were in between that you're
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:18.740]   throwing away to calculate the pixel vectors
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.340]   so that you can put the motion blur back
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.500]   into the 24 frames a second.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.780]   So you could shoot 120, have 120, but deliver it 24.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:25.280]   Sorry.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:25.980]   There's a good--
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:31.020]   Red has a good description of this on their website
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:34.500]   because I guess you can change this stuff.
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.940]   But--
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:39.660]   What made it make sense for me is the idea
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.700]   that just because it shoots 24 frames a second
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:46.540]   doesn't mean that each frame is 124th of a second--
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:46.900]   I like that.
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:48.420]   --open aperture, right?
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:48.920]   Right.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.020]   So that's the--
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:50.540]   I like that.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.020]   That's a good description.
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.180]   And if you think about photography,
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:55.020]   that could be blurry or not.
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.020]   Right.
[01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:59.220]   So you could make it 124, or you could make it 148,
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.540]   or whatever else.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.740]   And that was what made it all click.
[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:03.940]   And I had never thought of that before.
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:04.440]   All right.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.140]   It's like we're talking about this.
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:05.620]   Thank you.
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:06.980]   Complete digression.
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:09.220]   I'm watching Surface on Apple TV Plus.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:10.140]   Have you seen this yet?
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.220]   Alex, I want you to watch this.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:12.700]   How's it going?
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:13.980]   Because--
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:14.700]   drives me.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.700]   It's weird focus.
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.940]   And I think they're doing it on purpose
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:21.500]   because it has to do with the story
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.220]   because a woman's memory is she's got amnesia.
[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:25.220]   Great.
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:31.140]   And then-- but so they're playing with--
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:35.660]   like the focus plane is not consistent.
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:39.260]   Like so the-- like my eyes would be in focus by chin.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:42.060]   At the same focal plane would not be.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.980]   It looks like tilt shift or something.
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.700]   It's very--
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.980]   That sounds like a tilt shift where they're
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:46.820]   playing with the tilt.
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.060]   It's extremely disturbing.
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.500]   And I couldn't finish the first hour
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.580]   because not all shot that way.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:54.820]   That's the other thing that's weird.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:58.620]   And I guess it's probably her POV maybe that's that way.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.700]   It's-- anyway, assignment for next week.
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:02.620]   Just watch a few minutes.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.100]   I'm just curious what's going on with that.
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.740]   I've actually been looking at doing--
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:10.020]   you can get some really cool tilt focus.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:12.340]   And I've been looking at getting-- you can get a cannon mount.
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:15.660]   And so I've been looking to get in like a bellows tilt--
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.580]   like not just a tilt focus, but like a true bellows--
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:19.340]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.180]   Yeah, that's the real tilt shift.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:27.340]   To put on my black magic camera just to shoot kind of fun
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:29.420]   shots of ants and things like that.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:32.780]   Yeah, because it makes them either look like toys or giants
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:33.100]   or--
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:35.820]   I don't know what they're trying to do with it.
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.780]   But it's making me--
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:38.260]   not seeing it.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.780]   Not happy.
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:43.220]   So I literally couldn't finish it.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.380]   And maybe it's just me.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:47.100]   I mean, obviously it must just be me because--
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:47.780]   But I'm just curious.
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:49.340]   A lot of people have different sensitivities to it.
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.740]   Some people really don't like handheld.
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:53.020]   I mean, you said that now.
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:54.420]   I didn't want it any for one time.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.660]   Everyone was complaining about it.
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:56.420]   I thought it was great.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:57.780]   Now we're lost to it.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.700]   Now it signifies this is real.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:02.500]   It's the cinema verite.
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.540]   No, this is-- the office is a documentary, really, honest.
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:11.420]   Battlestar Galactica really happened in space.
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:12.100]   Totally did.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:12.620]   Totally did.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:13.740]   Those were shots from space.
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.100]   Which one?
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:16.660]   Oh, yeah, good question.
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:18.820]   Oh my god.
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:21.300]   I have a slight digression that's related to this, which
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.700]   is my friend Todd Bazziri, who works at ILM.
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.860]   He has a great Twitter account to use Bazziri.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:31.700]   He talks about these things that they don't talk about enough,
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:34.260]   which is how do you do a special effect where
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.900]   you need to have a clean visual of the person in the shot
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.660]   in order to do your VFX replacement?
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:43.220]   But it's almost totally dark.
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:45.660]   And he had a couple examples on his Twitter feed that blew
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.540]   my mind because what they did is they shot it
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:52.220]   at double frame rate and had a strobe light, essentially,
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:54.180]   firing off at half the frame rate.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:55.060]   Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.420]   Which meant-- and I just--
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:58.700]   I could not even believe that this is something you could do.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.180]   But the speed of light, it turns out, is really fast,
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:04.660]   is every other frame was perfectly lit.
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:07.940]   And then the off frames were dark like they wanted it,
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:11.820]   which means they were able to de-interleave those frames
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.900]   and have the exact same scene lit and not lit.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:19.340]   And so they could use the lit version to do all of their VFX
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:23.260]   for reference and put it in the dark shot for the final.
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.620]   And that this is a technique, apparently, that has--
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.900]   it's not super common.
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:29.580]   But when you get to high frame rates,
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:32.100]   these things that seem completely impossible
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.900]   that Alex talks about are entirely possible.
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:39.180]   Once you can capture that many frames of reality
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.780]   and slice it however you want, the idea
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:43.540]   that you can do that just blows me away.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.540]   It's exciting.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.060]   It's an exciting time to do this stuff.
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.620]   It's a lot of data.
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:50.180]   All these things just keep on.
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.660]   We started capturing it.
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:55.860]   I've been doing some tests at 8K 120, even--
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:58.940]   it's gigabit per second.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:23:59.980]   And that's really compressed.
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:00.860]   That's like 12 to 1.
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:01.300]   Actually, that raises--
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.220]   both 1 compression is a gigabit per second.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:05.300]   That's going to give us back on track.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.620]   So thank you.
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:09.620]   By the way, T-V-A-Z-I-R-I is--
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:10.540]   He's a great--
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.020]   T-V-A-Z-I.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:14.260]   And he's a prolific tweeter.
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:14.780]   So--
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:14.940]   It's great.
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:15.540]   Really good.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.860]   He loves movies.
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:17.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.980]   So this brings me to-- and you actually brought this up
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:22.820]   in the Discord, Jason.
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.860]   Lightning not really being a fast enough transfer
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:30.940]   for some of these higher frame rate, higher bit rate stuff.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:34.220]   Is this the last iPhone with Lightning?
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:35.540]   Probably.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.260]   I think probably it is.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:38.820]   I think all the rumors are that they're going to go to USB-C
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.020]   next year.
[01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:42.000]   The rumor is also the iPad 10, which
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.100]   is the base model, will also be USB-C this year.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:45.580]   So this--
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.500]   Yeah, it's time.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.000]   It's time.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.780]   Lightning had-- like, keep in mind,
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:51.340]   Lightning was invented at a time when Apple was frustrated
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:54.620]   that the USB-C stuff was just not going to happen fast enough.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:56.220]   And so they made their own thing that
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.260]   did what USB-C would do.
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.980]   But a couple of years later-- and so Apple was out there first.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.660]   And then they got in so much trouble with people angry
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:07.420]   that all of their docks and cables and stuff didn't work,
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.420]   that I think they've just sort of left it on the table
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.020]   like if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:16.320]   But I feel like we're at the point now where Apple has almost
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.760]   moved everything to USB-C or Thunderbolt
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.680]   with the USB-C connector, right?
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:23.280]   And so it seems like it's time.
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.520]   And that doesn't necessarily mean faster connections.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.760]   But if Apple is going to have an iPhone
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.560]   Pro that shoots 8K at high frame rate or whatever,
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.520]   it might be something where they roll in the fastest wire
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.360]   transfers that they can to get that data off as well.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.120]   But that's next year.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.120]   That's not rumored for this year.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.200]   Yeah, and I wouldn't be surprised that the Pro version ends up
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.300]   with USB-C or Thunderbolt--
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:46.860]   You think this year?
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:49.620]   Thunderbolt, or-- and then the regular version ends up
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:50.420]   with nothing.
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:52.220]   Like, it's just like we're going to get rid of the connector.
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:53.940]   That would be next year, though, not this year.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.100]   Yeah, next year.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.640]   I mean, I'm not a complete believer in the No Connector
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:57.980]   rumor.
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:58.700]   I know it's out there.
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.500]   And I'm sure it's a dream for somebody at Apple.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.780]   It's like, oh, the portless iPhone.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.440]   But there are so many things that are
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.380]   enabled like bad things in terms of fixing a broken phone
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.040]   by plugging it in.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.340]   Although I have a--
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.160]   one theory is that they're going to do a smart connector
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:11.580]   or something.
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:14.760]   So there is a way to get data off of it via something
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:15.900]   like they have on the iPad.
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:17.660]   But it's not a plug like it used to be.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:19.980]   But yeah, I think at least some of these models
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:21.260]   are going to have a USB-C.
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.260]   And they're going to be able to do fast data transfer.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:25.980]   Because if you're shooting all of that video,
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:27.740]   you're going to want to get it off there.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.180]   Why if I was not going to do it?
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.460]   So let's move to-- and then maybe they'll
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:34.740]   do AirPods in September, AirPod update, which, for some reason,
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:35.660]   just couldn't care less.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:40.000]   But anyway, if you care, September, right?
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.280]   Would be when you'd get new AirPods.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:42.760]   It's funny.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.760]   I love my AirPods.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.720]   And now I have different headphones
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.840]   that I use for different things.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.800]   And the one that I use the least is my AirPods.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:50.280]   By the way--
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.280]   --since I've had--
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:51.780]   I've had--
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:52.920]   I've used different ones.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.960]   It's the winner of the most used earbuds
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.240]   on national television.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:58.640]   There you go.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.640]   Easily.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.440]   Easily tele--
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.280]   I mean, there's no reason to put them on, except for your ear.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.000]   It's an easy way to communicate your own headphones
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.780]   because you've gotten something really white that's
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:06.280]   taking down.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:06.980]   Oh, I'm in my ear.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.220]   And then October would be--
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:11.220]   will they announce the Mac Pro?
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:15.420]   I don't know about that.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.780]   I got to do it this year.
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:18.220]   Rumors are that, yeah, rumors are
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:21.020]   that they've decided to build it on the M2 instead of the M1,
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.260]   and that gives them a little more time.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.300]   I think they'll probably announce it by the end of the year.
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.980]   But they might.
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:26.620]   It's possible.
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:28.580]   It sounds like that's going to be a Mac and iPad event
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.900]   in October that they're going to do.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:30.900]   New laptops.
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:32.060]   And less releases and new hardware.
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.420]   And two laptops, yeah.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:33.940]   Right.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:38.080]   And for people who are holding off in the M2s now
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.400]   because of thermals, presumably the MacBook Pro 14 and 16
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:46.640]   will have fans and be less thermally constrained.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.080]   I mean, the M1s are already faster than those systems.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.640]   That shouldn't be the reason you're holding off.
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.040]   Yes, so weird.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.320]   That will be presumably an M2 at some--
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.160]   well, no, I don't think it's that weird.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:00.560]   The M1 Pros and Macs and Altros are all way faster than that.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.760]   The M1 is a consumer chip.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.120]   The M2 is a consumer chip.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.120]   That's what they're made for.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.760]   They're not made to do more than that.
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:08.480]   But yeah, I mean, it would be all fascinating, right?
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.480]   People say it's one more better in their minds.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.520]   It's one better, isn't it?
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.720]   Yeah, so I think it's confusing to normal people.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.200]   Anybody listens to our shows now, I think,
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.880]   by now understands.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:17.840]   It's a challenge for them.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.720]   But-- and I think that that's one of the reasons why they
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:22.160]   want to get the updates out there as fast as they can.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.080]   But--
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.640]   Because once it's one thing to see and rev again--
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.680]   --then you can say, oh, this is faster.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.760]   This is faster.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.800]   You can kind of see it.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:33.100]   But now you don't have-- you're missing that I end in to part.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:33.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.160]   We're looking-- the Apple has to meet
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.700]   its promise of having the entire line updated
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:39.600]   by the end of this year.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.800]   That would mean that we have to see a Mac Pro announced.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.520]   I don't think we'll see one release this year.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:50.200]   I think we'll see very, very, very late in the year.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.880]   We're going to actually see this thing actually exist.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.880]   I'm most interested to see how soon Apple's going
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:00.920]   to produce the first for real Apple Silicon Mac Mini.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:03.100]   Because the Apple Studio isn't a Mac Mini.
[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:06.020]   It's a Mac Studio.
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:09.700]   I'm keen to see the one that doesn't necessarily cost $3,000.
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:16.260]   But it's the $1,500, $1,300, mini desktop Mac that has--
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:20.340]   Not the MacBook Air Generation 1 Apple Silicon.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.140]   But I can configure how I want.
[01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:23.340]   I can get the CPU I want.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:26.860]   I can basically turn this into a desktop sub-pro-level
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:27.660]   workhorse.
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:30.480]   Because I really think that's the bread and butter of Mac
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.920]   desktops right there, the Mac Mini.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.820]   And I know that Alex is a big fan of having the big one.
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:38.580]   All the toasters slots filled with Mac Mini
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:42.860]   is each one chugging away at doing their own things.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:45.420]   I think at one time, my last company,
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:46.980]   I think we probably had near 30 of them.
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:48.900]   And there's glue for all kinds of things.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.420]   And now they're so much better.
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:54.220]   I only have-- I think personally, I only have eight of them.
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:56.260]   But I think maybe none.
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:59.700]   Is it a mistake of me to think of the Mac Studio as a just
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:02.060]   a Mac Mini, a Swole Mac Mini?
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:02.780]   It is.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:05.340]   But I think there's room for something below it.
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:08.940]   Apple still had the Mac Mini and then the Intel Mac Mini
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:10.100]   that was more powerful.
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:13.980]   I feel like Andy is looking for the thing that's not just--
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:15.900]   I think there will be an M2 Mac Mini.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:19.380]   But I think everybody's hoping there will be an M2 Pro Mac
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.100]   Mini, which is just a little bit up.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:25.220]   Because there's no M1 Pro desktop at all.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:29.460]   You were either at Macs or Ultra or you're down at M1.
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:31.780]   And so for M2, I think everybody's hoping there'll
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:34.740]   be something that is an affordable desktop, probably
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:38.300]   a Mac Mini, and ultimately an iMac at some point, right?
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:42.340]   That has that extra power of the M2 Pro,
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:45.780]   or maybe even optionally the Macs, in that Mac Mini shape.
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.620]   And then the studio was up at the high end, right?
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:51.820]   It's Macs and Ultra if it sticks around,
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:53.780]   because especially that Ultra chip needs
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:55.380]   an enormous amount of cooling.
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:58.780]   But there's room in there for a more powerful Mac Mini
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:30:59.780]   that's not a Mac Studio.
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:01.860]   That's why it's sold for the additional cooling.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:02.580]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:06.140]   $2,000 for the one with the newer conditioning
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:07.460]   and factory stereo.
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:10.420]   That's not the position that the Mac Mini has always had.
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:11.860]   The Mac Mini has always--
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:14.900]   I've always been so impressed with the range of customers
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:16.220]   that the Mac Mini supports.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.420]   It supports the person who wants a Mac with the minimum buy-in.
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:21.300]   So you can get one for--
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:22.220]   perfectly useful.
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:23.460]   Won't be terribly powerful.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:26.780]   But perfectly useful for $6, $7, $800.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.740]   But then there are going to be the ones like me
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.140]   who are going to really spec it up past the $2,000 range.
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:36.380]   And this one is going to have maximum storage, maximum RAM,
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:39.580]   the beefiest processor that doesn't require a hover
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:42.260]   skirt around it for cooling, all that sort of stuff.
[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:44.220]   So that's why I really think--
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:47.460]   I've got the Mac Studio in a BANCE,
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:49.860]   but I really do think that when Apple comes out
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:52.540]   with a modern Mac Mini on Apple Silicon,
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.700]   that's where this money that's taped to the bottom of my desk
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.340]   is going to go.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:57.500]   With the Intel--
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:00.580]   The Intel model still for sale at $1,000.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.020]   They put it down on the page.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.420]   But that's Apple saying, hold this spot, right?
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.940]   Because we know that the M1 Mac Mini is not powerful enough
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.460]   for a lot of the Mac Mini tasks.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:11.260]   And I feel like that's absolutely what's
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:15.260]   going to slide on in there as there'll be an M2 Pro for $1,000
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:16.700]   Mac Mini.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:17.540]   Because I think--
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:21.220]   Mac Mini starts with $6, $700 right now for the M1.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:23.940]   And then the Intel 1 can finally go off the price list.
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:24.740]   Yeah.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:26.900]   I have to admit that the reason I have so many is that--
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.180]   it's not like I bought a bunch of them at one time,
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:33.380]   but most of them I bought six of them at one time.
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:36.220]   But I find myself going, oh, I just
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:38.460]   need one more thing to do the thing.
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.340]   And at $600 or $700, I'm like, oh,
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:41.460]   I just buy another one of these.
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:43.220]   And we'll call it a day.
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.900]   But it's not like-- if it's $2,000, I'm like, no, I can't do that.
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:47.700]   Like, I--
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:49.260]   you know, it was a lot.
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:52.580]   I spent $3,000 on the Macs, right?
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:56.340]   Not the-- I didn't get the Ultra Studio.
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:57.620]   And I was like, oh, I haven't bought
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:59.380]   and spent this much money on a computer for a long time.
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:02.060]   I could have owned four or five Mac Mini's for the same one.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:02.900]   This one better be good.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:04.660]   And it's proven to be really good.
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:06.020]   But it was--
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:08.380]   you know, I think that the Mac Mini's,
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:09.740]   there are so many things you can do with it.
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:10.900]   I'd much rather have--
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:12.780]   if when I look at a $2,000 laptop,
[01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:14.380]   I'd much rather have three Mac Mini's.
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.620]   You know, like then the laptop.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:17.860]   In a trench coat.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.360]   That's actually--
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.660]   I don't travel very much anymore.
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:23.160]   I-- so I don't really care about laptops.
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.720]   Like, laptops are like, oh, OK.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:28.000]   I'm most-- well, because you never know
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.560]   where you're going to be shot at.
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.560]   So you got to have a Mac Mini in every pocket
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.000]   just to make sure that you're not--
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.440]   It would take a bullet for you.
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.160]   So that is--
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.160]   That could be there.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.160]   That could be there.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:39.280]   I think for those of us working at home now,
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.160]   because I work at home most of the time,
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.000]   just think about how often you take that laptop out of your--
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.360]   out in the woods.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360]   Very carefully.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.200]   Out of the--
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.200]   In the interland.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.200]   My laptop is comfortable.
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.360]   Not very portable only so I can go from the living room
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.040]   to the bedroom to the kitchen.
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.120]   That's the portability I'm looking for.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.000]   And the reason that I like a Mac Mini
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.480]   is because I don't do that.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.640]   So it is when I walk out of my--
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.040]   Just have one in every room.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.360]   So you don't have to carry it around.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.320]   No, no, no.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.680]   When I walk out of my office, the most advanced thing outside
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.320]   of my office is my Apple TV.
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.920]   Like, my office is where I work.
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.560]   And the rest of my world is my phone.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.480]   You know, I spend a lot of time with phone.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.320]   But I don't-- but I don't have--
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.760]   I don't like having computers outside the office
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:18.800]   because then I work all the time.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.040]   It's my security blanket.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:23.680]   I can't go anywhere without a laptop under my arm.
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.240]   Anywhere.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.280]   Phone.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.760]   Phone is not big enough for me.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.720]   I need more real estate.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:35.440]   Speaking of which, Wither, the large screen iMac, is that gone?
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:35.960]   Forever?
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.040]   Are we going to stuck with 24 inches forever?
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.120]   I think he's going to hold this place.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.680]   Yeah, Mark Gurman says that it's coming.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.680]   But it's just that.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.680]   I see that.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:44.680]   But wait, or it's like--
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.680]   Good question.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.880]   I hope soon.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.160]   But it sounds like not soon.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.520]   It makes me very sad, too.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.320]   I mean, I've now-- I bought an external display in a Mac studio
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.240]   and I'm pretty happy with it.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.960]   But I was a 27-inch iMac user for many years there.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:01.360]   And if they had made an M1 Pro 27-inch iMac,
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.120]   I would have bought it.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.080]   And they have this--
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:03.880]   We have rumor.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:04.240]   I'm a--
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.680]   Because it might even be M3 before we see it all.
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:07.600]   I think it's going to be--
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:08.600]   I think it's going to be next year.
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.120]   And I think it'll probably be an M2 Pro 27-inch iMac.
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:15.800]   And they'll call an iMac Pro for kicks and we'll be happy.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.320]   OK.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.000]   Let's make that.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.440]   I think that maybe the large screen iMacs are a device whose time has passed.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.280]   It is kind of heartbreaking to consider that, boy, when that thing--
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:31.880]   when that thing gets out of date either because the CPU is not up to the task anymore
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:36.280]   or you can't run the latest OS or simply that, OK, well, guess what?
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.560]   You just lost your SSD.
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:40.200]   And now you're close enough into end of life on this device
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:43.520]   that you kind of want to value new one rather than get a motherboard swap.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.160]   It's really heartbreaking.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.440]   You're throwing away--
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:46.960]   The beautiful--
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.800]   --the power supply.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:48.840]   Huge screen.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.960]   All of this stuff.
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.840]   When you could-- if you had just gotten a Mac mini and a display,
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:59.480]   even if it's time for you to upgrade the display, too, well, great.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.840]   Now your kids get a better-- get a monitor, get an upgrade on their gaming setup.
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.920]   It just-- there are things that are just seem like--
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:11.400]   it's so many circumstances, the big screen iMac is just wasteful.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:15.160]   And it's not going to deliver the advantages of-- here's a compact--
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:20.240]   just like the original Mac from 1984, the way that every low-level Mac and iMac
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.120]   has been since, the concept that at some point you can grab it, pick it up,
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:27.080]   move it to another room, and then congratulations.
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:30.640]   Now you've got-- if you're too sick to get out of bed, now it's gone your nightstand
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.400]   and you can actually be gaming or whatever in bed, put in the kitchen, whatever.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:36.400]   That's the route.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.520]   That's what you use a small screen iMac for.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.680]   I just don't see what the large screen iMac is going to be--
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:45.880]   Our old iMacs go to John's, so he can do things like run his house automation
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.600]   and stream to it.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:52.240]   You're a beautiful, five-prey monitor.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.560]   It's a brain the size of a planet, and now they've just got me showing
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:59.240]   what the weather is today and a picture of the grandchildren.
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:03.760]   I have old iPads and old Mac minis and old--
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.880]   I have my little tellestrator that I use here.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.160]   This is a 2012 Mac mini.
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.640]   Yes, this.
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:10.640]   You know, that just laying around.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:11.640]   It's not like I went out and bought it.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.320]   It's good if you have little jobs that they can do, but it just feels sad.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:18.480]   It's like a Raspberry Pi, but it was just laying around.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:20.480]   It's like a $5,000 Raspberry Pi.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:23.240]   Well, no, but it's not anymore.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:24.240]   It's now--
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.240]   But it was.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.240]   This is the point.
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.240]   That's the point.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:28.240]   It was.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.440]   With the way the Raspberry Pi is self-aware right now, it's probably reselphised.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:33.560]   Literally, I think, John, are you using a Mac--
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.920]   An iMac to stream?
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:35.920]   No.
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.320]   No, do you use a Raspberry Pi for that?
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:39.880]   But do you do other things with the iMacs?
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.880]   I know.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.960]   But I would also like to think that people are mostly repressed.
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:45.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.960]   Go ahead.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.240]   I would also like to think that people are going to be clever enough to take advantage
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:53.760]   of continuity in the future to say that, well, maybe I'm not going to turn this--
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:38:00.320]   my first generation Apple Silicon Mac mini into a media server in the living room.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:04.920]   I'm going to keep it like I'm going to have a stack of two.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.840]   And I'm going to have-- it's going to have its own separate monitor right next to the
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:12.200]   monitor for the brand new Mac mini that I just bought.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.440]   And the fact that I can simply use one keyboard or mouse sort of invisibly between these two,
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:23.160]   I can now, whenever I'm ripping a DVD or a Blu-ray, or doing a big transcode, basically,
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:27.800]   these extra processors also happen to have their own cooling, their own power supply,
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:30.280]   their own data channel, everything.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:35.480]   It's the flexibility of having this-- again, snap another red Lego brick onto the stack.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:43.760]   If you have these devices, I mean, $3,000 for a Mac Studio or $3,000 worth of Mac minis,
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:49.600]   which you can then deploy and redeploy like Nanite's exactly where you need them to go,
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.840]   that's an interesting proposition.
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:54.200]   Well, October will be interesting.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:55.800]   We'll have lots to talk about.
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.960]   And expensive, I'm guessing, for me.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.280]   I think September is going to be expensive because I skipped-- I have an iPhone 12 and
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.880]   a series 7 or a series 6, I guess.
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.480]   So I skipped last year.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.920]   I started saving up about now.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:11.920]   Just go.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:12.920]   But you're going to--
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:17.280]   And with the phone, I've definitely learned to get this phone.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:21.680]   The phone that I have now, the 13, is going to go to my wife who doesn't like to spend
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:22.680]   money on phones.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.760]   And I'm like, but the pictures are so much better.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.760]   We do have a nice hand-me-down system.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:30.520]   None of this gets wasted.
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:37.560]   It's the very end of the hand-me-down that Lisa calls the camera wrist.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.560]   It's a good camera.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:39.560]   Swapa.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:40.560]   A ton of clock.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.560]   It's a ton of clock.
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.560]   You put it on there.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.840]   That's where the poor person at the end of the food chain has to come up to you and say,
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:50.160]   yeah, but this is a great SCSI Terminator.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.640]   I need the black SCSI Terminator because this is a 2FX.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:40:01.240]   I gave my son one of my old iPhone 10 and I gave my daughter the iPhone 12 Pro.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.240]   And he's like, what?
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.240]   Why the man?
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.240]   And I was like, oh, I was like--
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:08.160]   I was like, because I've seen what your phone looks like.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.320]   I mean, the button was hanging out.
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:10.320]   What you tell him is--
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.320]   What you tell him is--
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.320]   That's the greatest iPhone they ever made was the iPhone 10.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:18.160]   No, I said, if you can make it a couple of weeks.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.160]   I have-- because I have some old ones.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.160]   I have another one.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.160]   I have another one for testing.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.160]   I'll just give you another old-- but I'll give you an old one.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.760]   But I just want-- if you crack that one, I will not feel horrible.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.360]   We practically have a lab set up when the new iPhones come in.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:35.120]   Where we take the Sims out, put it in the new one, pass it down, and then various family
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.960]   members are at the table.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.040]   This old one goes to him, and then then then then then it's hysterical.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:42.440]   But that's also why I've gotten into it.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.520]   I put it in a case.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.000]   I put a screen protector on it.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.560]   I'm not going to be the only one that uses this in the family.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.080]   Yes, it has a future.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.760]   And so it's going to go out with a case.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.560]   And your job is to keep it that way until the next one.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:57.120]   And yeah, exactly what we were talking about, trying to keep feeling like they're new.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:04.640]   So you see periodically I will pick Alex's brain for things like whatever the hell 180
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.400]   degree shutter is.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.640]   You can do that yourself this Thursday.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:11.000]   Alex is doing an AMA.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.680]   The rescheduled AMA, 9 AM Pacific.
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.240]   That's noon Eastern time.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.960]   That's 1600 UTC.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.720]   If you're in Club Twit, that's the deal.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:24.360]   And then the following week, I'm excited.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.800]   Stacey Higginbotham's book club will be doing Clara and the Sun.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.800]   Still time to read it.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.720]   It's not a long book, but it's sure a great book.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:34.200]   Highly recommended by Ishigaru.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:36.160]   That's just one of many things that goes on in the club.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.760]   And I wanted to use this time to solicit your membership.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:43.040]   Club Twit is $7 a month.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.360]   People told us on the cruise, they said, "You should really raise that."
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.360]   Nope, we're not going to raise it.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:49.720]   We think it's a, you know, we want everybody to be a member.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:50.720]   You could afford it.
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:53.080]   So if you can afford a couple of lattes a month, what do you get?
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.760]   Add free versions of all the shows.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:58.360]   You get access to this Discord, which is more than just events.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:04.240]   It's a conversation, space on all kinds of topics, not just even the shows.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.040]   And then the Twit Plus feed, which has all the stuff that we don't actually get into
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.040]   the shows.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.440]   And there's a lot of it.
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:16.880]   Pre and post show and special shows like the Untitled Linux show, the Hands-on Mac, Hands-on
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.440]   Windows, both of which are club only right now.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.720]   Stacey's book club, same thing, the Gizfiz.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.960]   We have a lot of shows that are in that Twit Plus feed.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.800]   $7 a month for that.
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.920]   And let me tell you why it's important to us.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:33.360]   For instance, here's an example today on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.880]   There was one ad.
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:37.280]   So that means there's a shortfall.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:41.720]   And the club members really help us make up that shortfall.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:47.680]   It's very up and down the ad business right now in complete turmoil.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.000]   We realized that the ideal way to do what we do would be with listener support.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.040]   So this is how we're doing it.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:57.320]   We didn't take away anything from people who listened to the free feeds.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:58.320]   Those are all there.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.120]   But we have started adding things because the club helps us pay for it.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:04.800]   So if you're not a member of the club, please think about it.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.560]   Go to twit.tv/club, twit.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.440]   There's monthly, there's annual, there's corporate memberships.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:11.200]   And you can buy shows individually.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:14.800]   For instance, if you just listened to Mac Break Weekly, the ad free version of Mac
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.440]   Break Weekly is less than $3 a month.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.320]   So all of that is at twit.tv/club, twit.
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.760]   And we really thank you for that.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.160]   Coming up, let's talk about ads.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:32.080]   ATT application tracking, what is it?
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.520]   Application tracking transparency.
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:36.920]   Kind of in the news, for two reasons.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:41.600]   And Apple is about to add new ad units.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.960]   Mark Gurman, Bloomberg.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:47.600]   Apple finds his next big business showing ads on your iPhone.
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.560]   Oh, great.
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:53.920]   And then along with that, by the way, that hasn't happened yet.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:59.400]   But Gurman says Apple is set to expand ads to new areas of your iPhone and iPad in search
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.640]   of the next big revenue driver.
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:08.880]   But there's also an interesting piece about the effectiveness of ATT.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:15.200]   This is on Nick here's Pixel Envy blog, ad tech revenue statements indicate unclear
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.520]   effect of ATT.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.920]   Facebook and everyone else very quick to say, oh, we're going to lose $10 billion thanks
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.720]   to Apple allowing you to turn off tracking.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:33.520]   But at the same time as that happened, COVID happened, the recession, currency fluctuation,
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:37.000]   supply chain issues, all of these things affected the market.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:43.680]   And there is some evidence that ATT did not have as much of a negative effect as some
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:45.080]   are claiming.
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:51.080]   One of the points of evidence here is that the iPhone is much more popular than Android
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:55.840]   only in North America, everywhere else the reverse is true.
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:02.600]   And yet, so in other words, ATT is only mostly available to people in North America, yet
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:07.120]   the same revenue drops occur globally.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:13.800]   So one would expect North American revenue would fall faster in Q3, but it's not exactly
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.640]   the case.
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:17.240]   So there's other headwinds.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:21.360]   It's another cocktail of headwinds, as Luca Meister might say.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:22.360]   Yes.
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:23.360]   That refreshing cocktail.
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.240]   What do you guys think of all that?
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:33.040]   Well, speaking of headwinds, that's an interesting thing to evaluate because Facebook and meta,
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:38.320]   Facebook/meta, I'm sorry, it's like using Photoshop as a trademark verb.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:41.720]   You can tell me to call Facebook meta, I will not do that.
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.640]   But during their earnings call, that's one of the things they specifically mentioned
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:49.360]   as a problem that they're facing, a head with other facing in the future.
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.640]   Yeah, let me just throw this in.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:56.920]   Their yearly revenue decline was a billion in Europe, 600 million in North America.
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:00.720]   It was worse in Europe, where ATT is not a problem.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:06.280]   Yeah, but I'm sorry, what I was going to say is that they have to be really, really
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.800]   careful about what they say during an earnings call, because that could really trip them
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.680]   up into legal consequences later on.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.040]   So I wonder where they got that data from, if they felt as though they were confident
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.840]   enough to assert that during an earnings call, or maybe I'm just misremoving them.
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:24.920]   Well, yeah, I want to read the exact verbiage because they may have weaseled it, right?
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.760]   I can't remember what the exact verbiage is.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.360]   I'm searching for it right now to see the transfer of the transcript.
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:38.480]   Yeah, let's see, I've got the PDF, unfortunately, of the Q2 2022 earnings presentation from
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.480]   meta.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:47.200]   I wonder if they, well, these are just slides, so you need the transcript of what they said.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.800]   I mean, obviously, meta hates application tracking transparency.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.680]   Yeah, they hate it, obviously.
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:58.640]   So Ben Thompson wrote a piece on Stretecory the other day that said that Nick Heer's argument
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:02.980]   is a little bit weak because he doesn't factor in the strength of the dollar and the size
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:10.800]   of the iPhone market share in the different regions, and that if you adjust for currency,
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:15.880]   and then you consider the iPhone market share being so great in the United States, and then
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:21.520]   you factor in things like maybe the Ukraine war, what Ben basically says is, look, I'm
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:25.920]   sympathetic with the idea that a app tracking transparency is a good policy.
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:31.000]   But if you look at the results, we cannot pretend that it didn't have an impact.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.400]   It seems to have had an impact and that the argument, you could make the numbers look
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:44.360]   like they didn't, but if you adjust for currency evaluation and adjust for the how many iPhones
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:49.800]   there are in the North American market, then it sounds like it actually did have an impact
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.520]   to bet his business, for sure.
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:48:00.080]   I love Ben, and I trust him, but I think we need some economists to really weigh in on
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.480]   this and get all the data and really get some idea of this.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.480]   Sure.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:07.520]   I think it's more like Nick Heer says this, Ben Thompson says this.
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:08.520]   I think we can't--
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:09.520]   Some of Ben's argument is--
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:16.080]   Ben's argument is-- Well, it's just not intuitive that ATT would have had an effect, but--
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:20.440]   I guess I would say as the user, regardless of the effect, I think I have the right to
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.440]   say I don't want to be tracked.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.440]   Oh, I hear what he's saying.
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.080]   I don't think anybody's saying Apple shouldn't have that switch.
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:28.080]   If it should--
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:33.760]   If it lit the meta offices on fire, I don't care.
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:34.760]   Like I don't care.
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:40.840]   I want to be able to say as the data collection on us keeps on increasing, I think we have
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:46.480]   to increasingly have-- my question is whether AT&T went far enough.
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:47.480]   But here's the point--
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:48.480]   But here's the point--
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.480]   When you say--
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:50.480]   Here's the point of the option.
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:55.400]   --of the argument from the consumer's point of view is does ATT really accomplish anything?
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:01.120]   If it didn't hit ad markets in the way that Facebook's whining about, then ATT isn't really
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:02.440]   accomplishing anything.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:05.240]   But I just think that window dressing.
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:08.800]   Well I think that Apple-- I think this is the beginning of Apple going down a path, not
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.800]   the end.
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:12.800]   So I think when we say, well, it doesn't have-- the thing is if Apple went all the way--
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.800]   It's a start.
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:17.480]   --if they could go in one year, there'd be congressional meetings and there'd be a
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:20.480]   bunch of other things that already are based on some of this stuff.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:28.480]   And so I think what you're seeing is Apple slowly circling the wagons around.
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:30.840]   We're going to keep on turning this dial up.
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:33.200]   We're going to make it allow you to be more private.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:35.840]   We're going to take-- we're going to allow you to say, I don't want to be part of these
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:36.840]   things.
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:38.840]   I'm going to turn this off, this off, this off.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.160]   But they can't do it all at one time.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:43.760]   And so yeah, sure, it's not going to have the impact that it can have.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:47.840]   But I think that as you look at the overall view of what Apple's doing, we're going to
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.640]   let you hide your email.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:53.000]   We're going to let you opt out of ATT.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.200]   We're going to let you close down your phone some more.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:00.000]   This is a-- and I'm not saying that they're being altruistic or they're on our side.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.240]   This is just their business model.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.400]   Privacy is a business model that they're going to keep on moving down the path.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:07.880]   And by the way, I do have the transcript in front of me.
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.480]   And they do mention this four or five times.
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:15.760]   Zuck talks about-- doesn't mention the feature by name.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:23.560]   They simply refer to iOS feature changes, Apple iOS rollouts, but they refer to having
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:28.160]   targeting and measurement significant headwinds as a result of these changes.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:31.200]   But you're right, there is some weasel language in there.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:36.040]   So that if they were to say that, oh, well, we didn't actually say that this specific
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:37.560]   feature was dishing us.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:42.920]   It could also be the nearly universal use of ad blocking these days.
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:43.920]   It could be a lot of things.
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:49.000]   I mean, I use Firefox, which literally explicitly blocks Facebook.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:55.440]   So I think more and more, it's a consumer revolt against tracking that really is going
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.240]   to hurt these companies.
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:01.920]   And I think it had to do with just how crazy the company's got.
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.600]   This was something that worked really well.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:08.160]   And they just were like, well, we can connect it to what you're spending on.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.760]   We can connect it to when you're at Safeway and what did you buy?
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:12.800]   And how do we add that to your profile?
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.720]   And who are you standing next to for a long period of time?
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.440]   Let's add that to your profile.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.120]   And what are you watching at home?
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:21.800]   Well, let's add that to your profile.
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.520]   And we can add all these things.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:27.720]   And I think at some point, people started to get weirded out because they were talking
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:30.400]   at a party with somebody who-- and now they're hearing it.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:35.240]   And they think, well, Facebook must be listening to me, which is probably unlikely, actually.
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:38.720]   But it's because that person, the other person who's talking about it did a surge.
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:39.880]   You were standing next to them.
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:41.480]   And that they do.
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:46.160]   And so the thing is that it just starts weirding people out.
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:50.560]   And the people say, well, people are-- we don't get relevant ads.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.760]   I don't want relevant ads.
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:53.680]   Like, I actually don't want those.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:58.480]   Like, I want them to be just ads towards me because it's easier for me to ignore them.
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.560]   Like, you know, and it's-- I don't want things that catch my eye.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:03.560]   I don't want things to go, ooh, I'm now going to waste three minutes looking at something
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:05.720]   I didn't need until I saw the picture.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:09.480]   Like, I don't really want that as a consumer anymore.
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.480]   I used to.
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.600]   I used to think that was going to be cool, but now I don't.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.600]   It's too bad.
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:21.640]   They really wasted a golden opportunity because, you know, if in the abstract, if the--
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:26.760]   if you've seen this television commercial in 1980s that proud this vision of the future
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:31.440]   and say, now instead of being inundated with ads on all over your newspaper and ads all
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:37.920]   over your postal box, what if, like, they know that you're shopping for Paris snow tires
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:42.280]   and when there's a really good sale on snow tires, it'll basically alert you that, hey,
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:47.240]   here's this store nearby that has the snow tires of your rare style and rare size and
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:51.160]   it's nearby and we want to connect you to a local retailer.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:54.760]   And that's all possible and they could have done that, but they overreached and now it
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:53:00.240]   really is so intrusive that they're packaging and selling so much information on such a
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:01.720]   mercenary level.
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.960]   It's like they feel as though you're cheating them if you are not exposing as much of your
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:08.680]   life to these marketing agencies as possible.
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:13.600]   Ben Thompson also points out, and I think this is an important point, that app tracking
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:19.720]   transparency does not mean when you think it's-- he has a long discussion.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:26.360]   He says, "A lot of the most ardent defenders of Apple's ATT are against targeted advertising
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:31.920]   as a category, which is to say they're against companies collecting data and using that data
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:34.040]   to target ads."
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.680]   He says, "That's not Apple's definition.
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:38.960]   That's not what Apple is doing.
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:46.280]   Apple from ATT is about tracking is only when data Apple collects is then linked with data
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:51.640]   from third parties for targeted advertising or measurement or when data is shared or sold
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:56.320]   to data brokers, which admittedly is the worst kind of ad tracking.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:02.040]   That's what ATT does, but Apple says the data that they collect and use for advertising,
[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:03.960]   that's not tracking.
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:05.280]   That's not what we're talking about.
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:09.520]   And this comes down to the fact that Apple is going to start doing more advertising.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:14.680]   Apple considers it third party ads and Apple considers all of the data it can collect about
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:19.120]   you as an Apple user from your behavior in the App Store, what apps you've downloaded,
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:24.920]   what subscriptions you have, anything your Apple Maps searches, anything that it collects
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:30.320]   about you as an Apple customer, it can build a profile for you.
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.320]   And if--
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.320]   And we've said that.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.320]   --change the content.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:34.320]   And that's what--
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.720]   Because it's a first party relationship and that's their argument, which there are only
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:39.440]   so many first party relationships.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:40.440]   There's kind of iOS and Android.
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:45.680]   And that's why they're being investigated over ATT by the EU, you would think the privacy
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:48.040]   regulators at EU would say, oh, this is a good thing.
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:51.560]   But what they're saying is it really is just at-- at-- at-- at-- at-- at-- at-- at
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:58.400]   managing first party companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, because they have their own
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:03.320]   data, it's only dis-advantaging third party tracking.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:04.320]   And so--
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:05.320]   Well, it's the advantage--
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:06.320]   --and so--
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:07.320]   And it wasn't--
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:08.320]   --there's saying it's Apple's self-dealing.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:09.320]   It's self-dealing on Apple's part.
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:10.320]   This is all to their benefit.
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:14.400]   I think that-- again, I think you could-- you could have Apple users decide, like, do you
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.400]   want Apple to track you?
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:16.400]   Do you want to--
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:19.600]   Well, that's a button we'd like to say, but there is no button to do that, right?
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:20.600]   That feature actually does exist.
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:21.600]   Oh, it does.
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.440]   There is a don't-personalize ads in iOS.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:25.160]   It is buried, but it is there.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.160]   OK.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:27.160]   So you can turn it off.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:31.360]   And I think-- I think the key point with-- with all of this is it's not just self-serving,
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:32.360]   right?
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:33.440]   It is self-serving.
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:40.160]   It is also-- I mean, I believe that Apple does believe what it says about privacy and
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.520]   about not being tracked.
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:47.000]   However, there are also people at Apple who realize that creates an opportunity for Apple
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.360]   as a trusted first-party source of information to make money-selling ads itself, right?
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:56.000]   So it's a little bit from column A and a little bit from column B. I think both are true.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.720]   It's like, you know, like, with so much where people say, "Oh, Apple cares about your privacy.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:00.720]   That's just marketing."
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:04.440]   It's like, "Well, no, it's not just marketing, but it is marketing, too.
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:05.440]   It's both of those things."
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:09.960]   But again, the third party is important, though, in the sense that the idea is--
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:13.000]   Facebook can still track you, and they can still look at what you like and all those
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.560]   other things while you're in Facebook.
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:19.120]   And that's not-- when you turn AT&T on what it does turn off, because they can't keep on
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:24.040]   selling all that, and making you-- basically cutting your information up into little blocks
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.480]   and selling it and trading it with everybody else.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:32.080]   And that is the thing that is really-- I mean, it is-- there is-- it's not just self-dealing.
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:35.240]   There is a huge difference between first-party and third-party.
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:42.240]   It's like, you know, first-party is you are in this platform, whether it's Facebook or
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:45.240]   Google or whatever, and that is the trade-off that you made.
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:48.480]   You know, third-party is whoring you out to everybody else.
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:49.480]   Absolutely.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:50.480]   Like while you're sleeping.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:51.480]   Absolutely.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.480]   And then take it from--
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:53.480]   And take it from your future roles.
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.480]   It is-- it should be.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.480]   It is-- it's evil.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:01.120]   Like, you know, and it's-- and first-party is, I'm in Facebook.
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:02.640]   I know that Facebook's going to follow me.
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:06.440]   I know they're going to try to customize my-- you know, my feed and everything else where
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:07.720]   I'm using Google.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:11.160]   And that's-- but there is-- it's not just self-dealing.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.200]   It is-- it is self-dealing.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:18.320]   I mean, first-party is, I agree as a user visually, I understand that I'm in this space
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:22.000]   and I'm getting tracked or I'm using these services and that's the trade-off.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.440]   Third-party is like a whole different-- whole different thing.
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:30.680]   You know, it's wak-- you know, it's all your data being just pushed out into all these different--
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:34.160]   you know, all these different data-- data brokers and everything else.
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:38.000]   And-- and we have-- again, some people may choose that that's fine with them.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.320]   It turns out about 30% think that that's fine and that's great, you know.
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:47.560]   But for those of us who want to choose to not be there, we should have the right to do that.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:55.640]   It ties into this article by Felix Kraus on his blog, KrausFX.com, iOS privacy.
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:56.360]   What a surprise.
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:01.560]   Instagram and Facebook can track anything you do on any website in their in-app browser.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:03.160]   Well, duh.
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:07.920]   I guess if you didn't know this, the-- you know, when you use the browser in Facebook and Instagram,
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:12.720]   you're not actually using a third-party browser.
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:15.240]   You're using Facebook and Instagram.
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:23.920]   And even though ATT is turned on and Apple runs WebKit, the nature of the code is that
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:29.760]   all third-party links and ads within their app using this custom browser will tell them
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.760]   everything.
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:34.640]   And I would know very little bit because the one thing is I still use Facebook, like I
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.160]   still go up on my computer.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:42.160]   I took all the-- all the memetta apps off my phone because the battery life-- the battery
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:45.760]   life is like literally twice as long, twice as long without--
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:52.200]   As an example, the Instagram app injects JavaScript code into every website shown, including
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:58.160]   when clicking on ads, which gives Facebook that information about everything you're
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:58:59.800]   doing on all those other sites.
[01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:03.400]   But I-- this, when I saw this, I thought, well, I didn't even want to include it in the
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:04.400]   rundown.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:05.840]   I thought, well, doesn't everybody know that?
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:06.840]   No.
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:07.840]   No.
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:08.840]   [LAUGHS]
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:11.360]   Nobody knows it.
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:16.400]   So just be-- just be aware, you know, when you're using Facebook properties, they're first
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.400]   party.
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:22.160]   Well, it's always-- it's-- it's a-- I really wish that there was some sort of a dingus
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:26.800]   that made it really, really explicitly clear that you know you-- know you have not left
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:27.800]   this app.
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:29.880]   It did not open this link inside the Safari browser.
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:33.760]   No, you do not have all the safety, security, and protections of the Safari browser.
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:38.160]   You are still in the realm of-- of-- of meta-- of meta world.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:40.960]   And it's-- meta world is still a dangerous and smelly place.
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:46.160]   Well, and-- and I think that I-- I wouldn't be surprised that if Apple didn't add that
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:47.160]   to it.
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:48.560]   It's just that, again, we're--
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:51.560]   You're slowly closing-- you're just slowly closing.
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:52.560]   I'd love to see that.
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:56.480]   But we had-- you know, we had the-- you know, we-- we talked about this thing in the past.
[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:59.160]   Like, Secret Service, when they close up a space, it's like they-- they close these
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:01.000]   streets and then these streets and they slowly go around.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000]   Yeah.
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.560]   And then they put the-- then they put the metal detectors in and now no one can do it in the
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:05.560]   other way.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:08.480]   You know, and so I think what we're seeing is Apple's just building a perimeter, you
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:11.920]   know, and-- and at some point they'll-- they'll-- they'll just keep tightening it probably
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:14.760]   for the next decade until it's pretty locked down.
[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:17.280]   Andy, you still post on Instagram, right?
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:18.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:19.280]   Would you--
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:22.920]   Would you consider getting rid of your Instagram account?
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:28.160]   The-- it gives me too much pleasure because there are a lot of-- I have a lot of parasocial
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:32.040]   relationships on Instagram that I really, really enjoy and that would be-- I'm getting
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:36.880]   something that is worth the abuse that I'm getting from Facebook.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.840]   It's not a terribly unfair trade.
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:43.280]   Do you use it on your phone or do it like Alex does just on the browser, on the desktop?
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:46.280]   I do-- I do it on my phone because I'm taking pictures on the phone as well.
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:47.280]   It's convenient.
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:48.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:52.560]   I've never had-- the face-- never once have I had the Facebook app on any of my--
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:54.560]   Oh, I don't even have a Facebook account.
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:55.560]   I have everything like that.
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.520]   But I feel like if I have an Instagram account I might as well have a Facebook account, right?
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:00.520]   Yeah.
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:02.280]   I mean, you can't get-- you can't get around it.
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:06.440]   And-- and to be fair, every-- every time this topic comes up I have to remind myself that
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:09.920]   I-- I think Facebook is just a terrible company.
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:14.440]   I think that they take joy in saying if you put a bear-- if-- if I explicitly as a user
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:18.560]   put up a barrier that says that I do not want you to cross this barrier, they'll nod and
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:22.400]   say, OK, well, obviously the job for me now is to figure out a way around this barrier.
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:26.280]   And it's just ignorant and it's just terrible and it's an adversarial relationship.
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:31.680]   But my real-- my real adversaries here are the independent data brokers because Google
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:34.680]   Google is connected-- I use a lot of Google products.
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:35.680]   I have a Google phone.
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:36.680]   I love it.
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:40.320]   I think it's a-- I think that it's a great transaction for me.
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:45.240]   But also part of the reason why I quote, trust, unquote, Google with my data is that it's
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:48.000]   too valuable for them to sell it to anybody else.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.680]   They'll use it to help target ads.
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:53.360]   But they're never going to sell my personal information to anybody else.
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:58.680]   Whereas the-- all these other stupid little rat-like data collection companies, if someone
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:03.320]   wants to know, hey, does Andy have any serious illnesses?
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:08.520]   And if so, where is-- where is he been getting treatment for the-- for those serious illnesses?
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:15.280]   And even though there are laws protecting my medical history, there will be data aggregators
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:20.880]   that will be able to systemically figure out that we can't determine exactly what his situation
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:27.320]   is, but yes, he is regularly seeking medical treatment for one or more serious diseases.
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:29.320]   And that's just not right.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.320]   Where does he live?
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:32.960]   Where is he to level to be at 4 p.m. on a Tuesday?
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:33.960]   How did he vote?
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:37.880]   These are all things that can be collected and simply bought and sold like potato chips.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:43.680]   And that is why it's just a terrible, terrible time to live in lacking any legal protections
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:48.520]   against abuse of my private information.
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:49.520]   Any other thoughts?
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:51.520]   Do you still use Instagram, Jason Snow?
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:53.520]   Yeah, but occasionally.
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:03:00.440]   And I sort of-- I can't deactivate my Facebook account entirely because I have a meta-quest
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:01.800]   and you've got to have one.
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:02.800]   But I'm like--
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:04.800]   That's by the way why I don't have a quest.
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.440]   Yeah, it's too good I have to have it.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:10.480]   But it's a-- I very rarely go on Facebook.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:13.320]   I very rarely go on Instagram, although I do occasionally.
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:15.000]   I don't like Facebook as a company.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.720]   But I think that there is something to the idea that there are first party relationships
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:25.960]   you have with companies that you can choose to trust and that that is not the same as
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:33.440]   companies facilitating the compilation of a profile, of a dossier about you based on
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:35.320]   everything you do on the internet.
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:40.680]   And I think that we can debate whether either of those are great, but one of them is clearly
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.560]   worse than the other one.
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:44.680]   And I think everybody would agree on that.
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:46.520]   I docked myself last night.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.880]   I thought I should see what is out there about me and went to these-- one of these sites
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:56.000]   we pay him $25 and they will do a background check.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.600]   There's nothing about me you can't find out.
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:03:59.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:00.600]   Yeah.
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:01.600]   Nothing.
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:07.680]   And again, this can already affect your employment status.
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:08.680]   It can already affect--
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:10.600]   There are laws against you.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:11.600]   Which is weird.
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:16.680]   We can't do a background check before hiring somebody, which is weird.
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:21.440]   But that's-- the perspective of employees protected by privacy rules.
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:25.280]   In these sites, you have to say, no, I'm not using this for employment.
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.280]   Right.
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:27.280]   I'm just stalking.
[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:28.280]   Exactly.
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:31.560]   Just stalking myself.
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:32.560]   It's bad.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:35.240]   I mean, there are no secrets.
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:36.240]   Yeah.
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:37.240]   Right.
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:40.080]   And I think that, again, we have-- there aren't.
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:42.680]   And you shouldn't assume that you're private.
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:45.800]   That's definitely something you should keep out of your head.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:52.240]   But I also think that we should keep on being able to be given more and more choice over
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:53.240]   how much we want to check in.
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:54.240]   Totally true.
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:55.240]   And we check out.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.240]   That's what we're all saying.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:59.240]   I'm like, I don't have a lot of friends that work at Facebook.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:02.320]   And I know a lot of good people are doing good things there.
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:06.160]   And it's not-- but the problem is their business model is based around our privacy.
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:10.600]   And so we're just at a fracture point in that area.
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.160]   I still have accounts on everything.
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:13.880]   Any time a new social network comes up, I open it up.
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:18.200]   I keep it there because I just don't know whether I need it later.
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:19.800]   But at the same time, I spend very little time.
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:22.640]   I think the only one that I spend particularly any amount of time is Twitter.
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:24.280]   And mostly because it's really short.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:25.280]   Like I don't have to--
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:26.280]   I think that time is--
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:27.280]   And it has a great filter.
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:28.280]   But it's also got a great filter.
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:29.680]   I-- we talked about in the past.
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:33.960]   I've gotten 150 terms that are mostly political that I don't see.
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:37.400]   So my version of Twitter is so much nicer than everybody else's evidently.
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:38.720]   Because people are like, skits so upset.
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:40.760]   And I'm like, I don't even know what is happening.
[02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:41.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:42.260]   So--
[02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:43.920]   Block and mute and fill in.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:44.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:47.560]   It's a wonderful thing.
[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:47.920]   All right.
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:54.640]   I think we should probably-- since it's getting late, getting time to pick our picks
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:56.480]   of the week.
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:00.680]   If you all agree, unless there's something I missed that you really want to talk about.
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:03.440]   I did want to talk about NASA setting an iPad to the moon.
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:05.240]   But we'll do that next week.
[02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:06.600]   Got to save something for next week.
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:09.080]   We're going to be just as short of stories for the rest of the month.
[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:09.600]   Yeah.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:10.960]   They've been saying they're going to do that.
[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:12.320]   They might actually do it sometimes.
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.680]   In the month, supposedly.
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:14.200]   Yes, I'll ask.
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:14.920]   Yeah, I know.
[02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:15.840]   Hopefully we'll get there.
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:16.800]   Artemis.
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:24.360]   An iPad so that Cisco, which is paying for this, WebEx can call Amazon Echo.
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:25.360]   That's got a question.
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:26.360]   Yeah.
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:33.040]   And by the way, it says, in an industry funded experiment, which tells me that Cisco, Amazon
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:37.400]   probably paid for it, I wonder if Apple, Apple doesn't pay for product placement.
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:40.880]   But I know all these stories mention the iPad.
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:43.280]   It's usually supporting NASA with what it does.
[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:44.800]   Yeah, that's kind of a wholesome.
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:45.760]   It's wholesome, yeah.
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:47.400]   It's wholesome.
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:51.840]   How much money was spent creating Pepsi and Coke dispensers that would work on the space
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:52.840]   shuttle?
[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:53.840]   A lot of money.
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:54.840]   Wait a minute.
[02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:57.960]   Do we have Pepsi and Coke dispensers on the space shuttle?
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:06.200]   Coca-Cola actually funded an actual fountain like drinks dispenser that actually flew on
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:07.200]   the shuttle.
[02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:13.640]   They were also, I think both Coke and Pepsi created, if you Google it, created cans with
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:20.240]   built in hard plastic straws on the top of it so that you could enjoy a can of ice cold,
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:22.440]   wonderful Coke in zero gravity on the shuttle.
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:28.120]   I don't, it'd be more fun to zip around the cargo bag with as a propulsion system, I think.
[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:36.720]   But yeah, I don't think taxpayer funds went into the, the investigation, the development
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:37.720]   and stuff.
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:39.280]   But yeah, it's a fun little thing.
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:43.920]   It's a little bit of a zest for the space shuttle, a little bit of zest for the brand.
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:46.000]   And it's kind of fun to think about.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.000]   Here it is.
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.960]   At some point, if I spend $50 million, I'm going to be looking for that Coke dispenser.
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:52.760]   It looks like a whipped cream dispenser.
[02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:53.760]   Yeah, it does.
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:56.440]   You could be doing nitrous.
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:58.280]   Coke is a little bit different.
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:01.360]   The dispenser's head is like offset.
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:04.160]   One giant sip for mankind.
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:06.640]   They're going to be, they're going to be a little bit of a...
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:07.880]   God bless capitalism.
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:11.400]   God bless it.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:16.000]   I like it that they have the cap is on a string though, so it doesn't go floating around.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:17.000]   What does this mean?
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.360]   Usage conditions may apply.
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:20.840]   I wonder if they went up and tested.
[02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:24.520]   They just wanted to do a vomit comment and just like, let's see how this works.
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:26.320]   That's a drink.
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:32.960]   Well, because as bad as it is to knock a sugar soda onto your keyboard gear, imagine just
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:41.800]   like having a small incident with this big cloud of sticky Coke basically can tell you
[02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:44.160]   it's way into things you need to get back home safely.
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:50.800]   In 1980, this is by the way from the Air and Space Museum, and the object is not on display
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:52.800]   at the National Air and Space Museum.
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:55.920]   It is either on loan or in storage according to the website.
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:00.320]   In 1984, researchers for Coca-Cola had an idea about dispensing carbonated beverages
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:06.160]   in space to give astronauts more choices to drink and also to create a stellar advertising
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:07.160]   opportunity.
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:10.800]   The company developed a can that would work in weightlessness to keep the coal of fizzy
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:12.680]   without spewing out of the can.
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:17.360]   NASA agreed to let the astronauts try the Coke device on a shuttle flight when Pepsi learned
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:21.880]   of this project, it wanted to participate, developed its own container.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:29.960]   Both Coke and Pepsi products were flown on STS51-F in 1985 so that crew members could
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:33.400]   evaluate the dispensers and do a taste test.
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:38.960]   Results were mixed and NASA did not add either company's product to the shuttle food pantry.
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:43.080]   Zero gravity messes with your sense of smell and taste too.
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:44.080]   COVID, huh?
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:49.640]   Yeah, well, because there is airflow right that is different in zero G than it is in
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:50.640]   normal gravity.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:53.040]   So, apparently things taste weird.
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.040]   Interesting.
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:57.640]   But don't go looking for this at the Udvar Hazy Center because it ain't on display.
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:06.200]   There was also on STS77, the actual fountain Coke machine that I was thinking about flew
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:12.440]   on STS77 as the described as the fluids generic bio processing apparatus to.
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:18.080]   It held 1.65 liters each of Coke and Diet Coke.
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:23.400]   The dispenser tested if carbonated beverage could be produced from separately stored carbon
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:25.640]   dioxide, water and flavored syrups.
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:30.000]   And if the resulting fluids could be made available for consumption without foam formation,
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:37.000]   just like in the FGBDA.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000]   It really is.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.240]   I don't know what Wendy's does like in the ice machine to make that special kind of ice
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:43.520]   that they make in the dispenser.
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:45.080]   That's the selling point for me.
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:46.880]   You know, you can get that.
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:50.120]   You can get a desktop.
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:53.880]   You can get a one that sits on a countertop that does the Wendy's ice.
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:56.960]   Here is by the way, because my wife won't give me the desk that which won't give me
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:58.400]   the counter space.
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:10:59.400]   That's $550.
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:01.000]   In case you're wondering, it'll do it.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000]   It'll do it.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000]   Let's get it here.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000]   Let's get it here.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000]   You get it.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000]   Is that all it is?
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000]   $550?
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000]   No?
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000]   That's your teeth.
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000]   Okay.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.880]   Here's an astronaut Curtis Brown preparing to activate the fluids generic bio processing
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:16.080]   apparatus to on the mid-deck.
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:22.760]   I note that it does have the name Coca-Cola right there and in prominent letters.
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:25.760]   The full wave device as it is described.
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:34.720]   Well, I think it's not only did NASA most likely get a little scratch to put that in there.
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:39.480]   They also got, I'm sure that Coca-Cola developed a whole bunch of technologies that were like
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:42.720]   might be useful and they probably spent $10 or $20 million on that that NASA didn't
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:44.120]   have to spend to figure that out.
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:46.960]   So it's probably useful.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:49.840]   This is a picture I want to frame and put up somewhere.
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:52.400]   I just think that's a free.
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:53.400]   This is Coca-Cola.
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:55.600]   We thought it'd be hal 9000 instead.
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:56.600]   It's the fluids.
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:00.200]   How do you get the Coke machine to work on?
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:01.200]   I'm sorry Dave.
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:03.000]   I only have Pepsi.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000]   Yeah.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.480]   Also, also the astronauts like I hope that they were fully briefed on this part of the
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:10.840]   mission because they would have had to bring their own quarters.
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:13.480]   Imagine like a dime short for exact change.
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:15.840]   He's got a pretty big fanny pack on those astronauts.
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:17.560]   Sure, it's maybe he has some quarters in there.
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:18.560]   I don't know.
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:19.560]   They're going exactly.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:20.560]   Okay.
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:24.400]   I'm going to pick some of the week time.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:28.160]   This show, you learned, I think we learned a lot about a lot of things on this show.
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:29.720]   That's all I'm going to say.
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:34.720]   We grew as being on the one to you, essentially related to Apple.
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:39.840]   Any tech podcast becomes shades into sort of choose your own adventure territory in
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:43.520]   August, the month before the last wave of price.
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:44.520]   Exactly.
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:45.520]   The wave is coming.
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:48.080]   Why don't you kick us off Andy with your pick of the week?
[02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:52.360]   Mine is a very boring, but oh my God, useful app that's been around for like five, six,
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:57.240]   seven years called folder tidy, which tidies or folders.
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:03.840]   And there's, I'm the sort of guy who I'm always just like buying this, buying like eight terabyte
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:11.600]   drives or 512 gigabyte of Samsung like T three drives and just using it as just like temporary
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:13.720]   storage or using it to free up space wherever.
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:16.280]   And it's just like a bucket where I just toss things into it.
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:19.960]   And when it fills up, I disconnect it, put some half hearted label on it and put it in
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:21.520]   the closet.
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:25.360]   Folder tidies automates the really makes it quick and easy to automate the process of
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:31.720]   organizing the stuff that's just in whatever whatever source folder or source volume you
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:32.720]   want to have.
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:36.520]   If it's as simple as saying, look, there's just this big pile of stuff where everything
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:40.560]   that I've downloaded just or tried to get off of the off of my MacBook to free up space,
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:41.560]   just got dumped.
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:45.520]   So please put all of the all the different file types in their own folders or separate
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:47.040]   them by dates.
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:48.840]   You can be a little bit more sophisticated.
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:56.240]   Like I download a lot of like museum art and use almost always what designates a JPEG
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.680]   that is actually like a piece of museum art from anything else that that I might have
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:04.200]   downloaded or copied it onto the drive, usually because it will have a date.
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.480]   You know, usually usually will not be like in the 21st century.
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:09.680]   So you can add filters and add specifications.
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:17.280]   Oh, by the way, if it is a JPEG or P and G file and it has a string of a string of number,
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:21.640]   a string of digits that are numbers that start with one nine, please put it in a file
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:24.440]   in a folder called fine art that you will then create.
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:29.720]   So it's just it's it's not designed to be like your you got to understand this three
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:35.480]   ring binder worth of scripting language and tags and and switches to make this work.
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:36.920]   It is very, very simple.
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:41.080]   Everything that it can do is right there in the interface, but it means that you can have
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:46.600]   truly I've had I've had a process like three terabytes worth of files and reorganize them
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:51.320]   and it takes just minutes to do because it's using every single new feature and leverage
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:55.040]   that the new file system of Mac OS has.
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:56.280]   And it's on it's normally 10 bucks.
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:59.960]   I think it's on sale for five bucks right now.
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:05.320]   And it is the sort of thing where if I were I shouldn't need this app because I should
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:10.160]   be more organized and tidy so that I'm always simply putting files away to where they belong.
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:16.800]   But once again, every single time I'm I've got like 30 gigabytes or less of space free
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:21.880]   on my MacBook, it becomes like the the the hurricanes coming.
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:25.520]   We got like 20 minutes to fill up the back of the car with as many possessions as possible
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:27.040]   before we evacuate.
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:30.200]   And that's how I just folder finder copy things off there.
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:33.120]   This will actually straighten it out so that with very, very little effort, you can get
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:34.760]   things organized on your own.
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:35.760]   Good stuff.
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:39.160]   Just before we go to another pick, thank you Scooter X in our chat room.
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:42.800]   There is a system issue in iCloud right now.
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:47.520]   If you go to the Apple system status page, some yellows under iCloud bookmarks, calendar
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:52.480]   contacts, drive, keychain mail, storage upgrades, web apps and photos.
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:57.160]   I don't know how extensive that issue is, but thank you Scooter X for pointing that
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:01.680]   at apple.com/support/systemstatus.
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:03.960]   Your pick of the week, Jason Snell.
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:09.640]   I am somebody who has read a lot about 3D printing stuff, but hasn't done any of my
[02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:10.640]   own.
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:11.640]   I don't own a 3D printer.
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:13.120]   I have not used a 3D printer.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:16.480]   And every now and then I come up against something on the internet where they're like,
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:19.120]   oh, well, you can just do it with this little 3D printed part.
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:20.120]   Yeah.
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:21.280]   I'm like, oh, great.
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:22.880]   How do I get that part?
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:25.160]   First, so we'll step one by a 3D printer.
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:26.960]   I'm like, no, I'm not going to do that.
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:27.960]   Forget it.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:28.960]   So guess what?
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:36.040]   There's a site called CraftCloud 3D where you literally upload the 3D file that somebody
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:38.760]   has offered you saying, just print this yourself.
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:40.200]   You upload it.
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:46.880]   You specify what materials, what standards, like all the little bits of what you do have
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:49.360]   to learn a little bit of 3D printing.
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:54.560]   And then it basically comes up with a list of people who will print it for you and mail
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:58.000]   it to you with different prices and different time frames.
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.400]   So you can play like $40 and get it in three days or $20 and get it in a week.
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:08.320]   Or you can get it from these people in Texas or these people in Massachusetts and you get
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:09.320]   to pick their--
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:10.640]   Oh, so this is really a brokerage.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:11.640]   This is--
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:16.200]   It's a brokerage, yeah, for people who are independently offering their services as 3D
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:17.200]   printers.
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:20.320]   Some fool who bought a 3D printer now trying to amortize the cost.
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:21.320]   Exactly right.
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:26.400]   And I have done this twice in the last month for a couple of different projects.
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:27.800]   And you know what?
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:29.360]   It was pretty great.
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:30.560]   Not-- I learned a lot.
[02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:36.000]   I learned a lot about like, if you don't order the sanded one, you have to sand it yourself.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000]   And that's not fun.
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.040]   So I ordered the sanded one the next time.
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:40.480]   But I learned a lot.
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:44.080]   I got stuff that totally did the job from what I wanted it to be.
[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:45.480]   You can get a sterling silver.
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:46.480]   Look at that.
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.480]   I just love the idea.
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:51.920]   You can pick your materials and you will be-- and your finished product.
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:53.560]   You upload the file.
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:57.920]   And then you just pick who you want and at the price that they are offering.
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:17:58.920]   And it works.
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:03.880]   And in fact, I even got a follow up from CraftCloud where they said, "You used somebody who was
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:05.880]   one of our new people."
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:11.720]   And it was an actual personal email saying, "Tell us how it went because we evaluate
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:14.320]   all the new people who come into our system."
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:16.320]   So I had a really good experience with CraftCloud.
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:21.480]   Boy, they have every pot-- I mean, they have steel, aluminum, brass, silver, all kinds
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:23.480]   of resins, titanium.
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:24.480]   Yeah.
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:26.840]   I mean, I just went with ABS, plastic, right?
[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:28.840]   Yeah, that's cheap because I'm sure of it.
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:29.840]   Choose your colors.
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:32.600]   And as you choose your materials, you get to choose colors and you get to do all those
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:35.520]   things that 3D printer people might do.
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:37.280]   But I'm not going to buy a 3D printer.
[02:18:37.280 --> 02:18:38.880]   So I choose this method.
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:39.880]   Cool.
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:40.880]   Yeah.
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:41.880]   It's even--
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:44.880]   And even if you have a 3D printer, it's a good thing because you can print in so many
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:50.000]   things that-- so I use one called Shapeways to do something relatively similar.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.800]   And it's similar to CraftCloud.
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:55.720]   It's just that it's all one big company, not outsourcing to lots of people.
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:58.040]   It's just one big company that does the printing.
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:01.040]   But I might want something metal, but I definitely don't want a metal printer.
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:02.640]   Like, that's really expensive.
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:04.720]   John, tell me we did have this.
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:08.680]   We use Shapeways to make some of the parts for our ATEM--
[02:19:08.680 --> 02:19:10.920]   Oh, was that for my little box switcher?
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:11.920]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:12.920]   Berkuse it.
[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:17.640]   Then what you do is you kind of iterate with your home printer and then you send it out
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:19.360]   and have it printed in something really great that you're not--
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:20.360]   That you're not never going to run.
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:22.960]   Yeah, that's a good method too.
[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:26.560]   If you do have a 3D printer, you use it as a prototypeer and then you get somebody who's
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:27.560]   going to do the metal one for you.
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:28.560]   Cool.
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:29.560]   Exactly.
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:31.520]   If I wanted to put it inside my body, I could use surgical resin.
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:32.520]   Nice.
[02:19:32.520 --> 02:19:33.520]   Okay.
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:34.520]   Or gold.
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:35.520]   Solid.
[02:19:35.520 --> 02:19:38.520]   There's no telling what you might find out there on the internet.
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:43.960]   But if you're in a position where you're like, I'm doing this project and it sounds really
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:44.960]   cool.
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:48.080]   But now your step seven is 3D print this thing.
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:49.080]   Right.
[02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:51.960]   So if you're going to get yourself a I'm not ever going to do that, you can get somebody
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:52.960]   to do it for you.
[02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:57.080]   This is actually just fascinating for all the materials you can use.
[02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:58.080]   Right.
[02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:00.200]   Also, I'll put in a plug for your local library.
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:02.320]   A lot of libraries actually have 3D printers.
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:03.800]   So you should check with your local library.
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:07.440]   You may be able to just bring the file there and print it right at the library.
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:09.080]   So that's another thing to try.
[02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:15.120]   But just one warning for people who are always been curious about 3D printing, it really is
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:16.880]   like owning a table saw.
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:20.520]   Like, oh, great, I have this table saw and now it'll cut everything.
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:22.600]   I saw it for bookcases.
[02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:23.600]   Yeah.
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:26.920]   It's well, because the thing is like it is a tool and the first prints you make from
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:28.600]   it are going to be terrible.
[02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:29.600]   Yeah.
[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:33.360]   And then that's when you learn that even though you spent like $500 on this printer, the expectation
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:37.080]   is that you know how to take it apart and adjust it so that it works properly.
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:38.080]   Right.
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:39.680]   And then you know how to manage all of the settings.
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:40.920]   Like, what is the feed rate?
[02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:41.920]   What's the temperature?
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:43.720]   Where's the what do we got on the bed?
[02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:44.960]   How have you sliced it?
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:45.960]   All of this stuff.
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:52.240]   It's not going to be like hooking up a laser printer to your computer and boom, in 10
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:54.880]   seconds you get a printed copy of your document.
[02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:59.840]   You are responsible for getting this thing to actually work right and the rules keep
[02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:03.320]   changing on you with every new thing that you do and every new material you try to print
[02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:04.320]   in.
[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:05.320]   It's great.
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:06.320]   It's lovely.
[02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:09.360]   But don't expect that, hey, I spent $300 and now I'm going to be, I'm going to be making
[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:12.640]   Star Wars figurines from the morning new at night.
[02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:19.040]   No, you're going to be making a blob of like weird oily string for at least three months
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:21.840]   and it's one of those bad prints costs you.
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:26.960]   And by the way, it'll be like a two day print and it'll fail like 20 minutes before the
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:29.720]   end and actually ruin everything for you.
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:31.200]   No, I'm not.
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:34.200]   Craftcloud3d.com.
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:38.360]   Alex Lindsey, pick the week.
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:40.480]   So my pick is this little guy right here.
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:42.200]   Oh, you bought it.
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:44.280]   Oh, I've been reading about it.
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:46.520]   Oh, so if you look at it, you can see that I am.
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:49.400]   This is the Insta360 link.
[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:51.680]   It's kind of a gimbal for the ground.
[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:52.680]   Look at it.
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:53.680]   It's so good.
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:55.680]   And it's so so.
[02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:57.360]   So it's so it's so it's smaller than it looks.
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.160]   Yeah, I'll switch the picture here.
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:00.960]   Let me let me let me it.
[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:05.800]   So this is I just want to show you what it looked like and then let me cut to the actual
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:06.800]   shot here.
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:07.800]   So here's a shot.
[02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:08.800]   Oh, that's a pretty good shot.
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:10.360]   It's like hanging out and think.
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:11.360]   Yeah.
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:14.800]   And the key here is that you have a lot of controls.
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:16.800]   So you know, so I have my.
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:17.800]   It's a PDZ.
[02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:18.800]   Oh, you can see.
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:19.800]   It's PDZ.
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:20.800]   Oh, yeah.
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:22.240]   I can definitely zoom in.
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:24.240]   Now I can also save presets.
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:29.600]   And so I can go, OK, well, I want I want this to be a preset, but I also want later
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:34.000]   I'm going to go in and zoom in and I'm going to hit another preset here.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.120]   And now if I hit this one and you can see that you can put a lot of them in there.
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:38.120]   It cuts to it.
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:41.320]   It doesn't zoom in like a, you know, but it but it will jump into it.
[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:45.760]   So if you're trying to set up a presentation now, the other thing that you have here is,
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:50.080]   of course, you can move it around here, but you can also again, just just zoom here.
[02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:52.800]   And again, to reframe, you just grab it.
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:53.800]   Just move it.
[02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:55.280]   You're not even right.
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:58.280]   So can you say, yeah, follow Rumsleg and make him dance?
[02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:01.160]   It won't follow Rumsleg, but it will shoot.
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:04.640]   You can have you can have auto tracking zoom whiteboard.
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:06.120]   So it'll it'll look at a white.
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:09.840]   You can put corners on a whiteboard, but look at all the thing to look at is.
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:10.840]   Wow.
[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:14.520]   Like a lot of settings was 4k and also.
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:18.720]   So you have auto exposure, but when I turn off auto exposure, it has a curve.
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:21.320]   Like I have a little, wow, a busy occur.
[02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:22.320]   Wow.
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:26.200]   Like I have a little curve that I can, you know, design what I, you know, design exactly
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:27.960]   how I want the contrast to work.
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:29.360]   This is very pro.
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:33.440]   I have control over my ISO so I can drop my ISO down a little bit if I wanted to.
[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:34.560]   I have control over my shutter.
[02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:38.400]   And a lot of these have had these, but because they make the software and this isn't limited
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:40.320]   to just what UBC will do.
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:43.920]   They've put a lot more into it into the camera and you get into more settings here.
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:48.280]   You have how it's going to track and the tracking, how fast manual.
[02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:49.560]   Is it good in low light?
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:50.840]   They claim it is.
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:51.840]   It is.
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:54.400]   It's actually, this is relatively low light now and it's pretty good.
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:57.880]   Now I can also turn it into HDR, which will make it a little grainier, but it's going
[02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:00.640]   to grab a lot more exposure there as well.
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:02.120]   And so it is.
[02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:07.680]   So we, you know, I buy, I buy a lot of these, a lot of these cameras and we test them and
[02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:09.400]   I always think I'm going to send them back, but I never do.
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:17.760]   So I've got a pile of 4K web cameras, you know, and what I will say is that it is, this
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:21.680]   is the first one that we've gone, oh, maybe we'll get this instead of the Brio.
[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:24.840]   You know, and Brio has been the one that has been like the standard and we just use it.
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:28.000]   Do you recommend the tripod kit or?
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.000]   I didn't.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:30.360]   Did I get the tripod?
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:31.360]   I got the tripod kit.
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:32.360]   It's 30 bucks more.
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:34.360]   I put it on a bunch of it's a quarter 20 on the bottom.
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:35.560]   If you have something else, you can use it.
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:38.240]   The tripod is really special.
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:42.160]   And so the it is, it's a little bit more expensive.
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:43.160]   It's 300 bucks.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:44.160]   I think it's $300.
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:45.160]   Yeah, $300.
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.160]   Yeah, $300.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:49.840]   So I'm about the $300 kit and it is, it's really, really good.
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:55.360]   In fact, if they made a $400 version with a one inch chip, this is a half inch chip.
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.520]   I'd pay, you know, with an HDMI out, we put it in our A-10, you know, like it's, it's
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:02.120]   a great little, it's a great little PTZ.
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:05.960]   It is, if again, if I was using, I'm going to take this.
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:10.280]   In fact, when I do the AMA with Twitch, I have to be in LA for that morning.
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:11.280]   Oh.
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:12.280]   I'm taking this with me.
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:13.280]   So I'll be on.
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:14.280]   I'll be on.
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:15.280]   Yeah.
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:19.400]   So I'm going to be on the AMA, the first time I show it in public of me, of it actually,
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:21.240]   because I have a 6K here, a black magic 6K.
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:24.720]   I'm not going to, you know, so, but all my, this is my new trip camera.
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:27.560]   So this is what I'm taking with me on the road instead of the Brio.
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:29.640]   And the Brio is going to be, I'm sure, very upset.
[02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:31.240]   They're not like, why am I not going?
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:35.560]   And so, so anyway, but, but the, but this is a good.
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:40.440]   If you play with it enough, it will, it probably needs one or two more firmware updates where
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:43.080]   it'll crash and suddenly it'll wander off.
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:44.600]   But you just unplug it and plug it back in again.
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:47.720]   And that's happened like three times since I've started testing it over the last week.
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:53.360]   And it's, it is a, but overall, it's just a killer little camera.
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:56.520]   The, again, the quality is at least as good as the Brio.
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:59.640]   If not better, the, the color is better than the Brio.
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:02.920]   The, the controls are.
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:03.920]   I love it.
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:04.920]   You can move around.
[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:05.920]   Do a presentation.
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:07.920]   It's like, give a camera operator.
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:12.040]   And that's what I'm using this for the most is going to be doing presentation, um, stuff.
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:14.440]   And I'm going to actually use this as my overhead camera.
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:18.360]   Less, less me and more of like, this is what I want to show you a close up.
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:23.640]   But for a teacher or someone doing e-learning or talking about a product, I could totally
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:27.720]   see someone using, uh, two or three of these.
[02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:31.360]   It has a few mode where auto corrects the parallax.
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:32.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:33.360]   So.
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:39.720]   It's so, so I think that it is, if you're doing, if you're talking about your product, if you're
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:46.080]   interacting with clients or part, or, you know, colleagues, if you are, um, uh, yeah.
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:47.320]   So you can see how it's, it'll correct.
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:49.760]   So he's using a hand gesture.
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:52.360]   And then it just goes, oh, I'm going to go over there to go to the preset.
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:53.360]   Wow.
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:55.320]   And it'll, it'll corner pen and lock to it.
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:58.280]   Um, and Justine as Rick did a really good video on it as well.
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:01.080]   So she'll show you, you know, she, her has a, it has a mic on it.
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:02.840]   I don't think it's particularly useful.
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:07.640]   But, but the point is, is that the, um, I think that if you, one of them is great, but
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:12.520]   I could definitely see someone who's going doing, you know, product demos, education,
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:15.300]   that type of thing, having two or three of these, one is a close up that you can show
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:16.300]   things.
[02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:17.300]   One is on you.
[02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:22.400]   We did notice, and I haven't, cause I haven't bought two yet, um, yet, uh, is that there
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:25.080]   is a little, um, you can, a little selector here.
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:28.680]   So I'm guessing that I can control more than one switch, you know, like I was like, oh,
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:29.680]   I wonder what that's for.
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:31.520]   Would you change them, you think?
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:36.640]   Or, uh, no, you put them in, you, you know, this would be a great, like, Mac mini, it
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:40.800]   only uses the, you can do a regular USB A. So you could have a Mac mini with a couple
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:41.800]   of these plugged in.
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:45.560]   And then if you're using something like OBS or memo live, memo live is probably what I
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:46.520]   probably use on a Mac.
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:52.820]   Um, OBS is not super stable, but you can also remember these will show up in keynote.
[02:27:52.820 --> 02:27:58.600]   So you could have a keynote, um, presentation and be, you know, having, uh, you know, you
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:02.800]   can do and possibly a close up and even again, you could go to the keynote presentation,
[02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:05.400]   go to the slide, hit the position and go to it.
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:08.720]   No, we haven't one thing we have, we have, we're reaching out to them and trying to find
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:10.880]   the right person to talk to it into, into 360.
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:15.840]   We're hoping that they're going to add an open API so that we can, you know, set up
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:19.920]   a button and I hit something on a stream deck and it, you know, changes the, this and then
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:23.240]   changes the slide and then moves over here and those types of things.
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:28.160]   But it's the first camera that we've really seen that I felt like was a real jump up for
[02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:30.440]   our web camera that I've seen since COVID started.
[02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:33.680]   We felt like it was going to take a couple of years and it was about a couple of years
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:36.880]   that, you know, before people really start building stuff for us.
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:40.400]   And I think this is the, this is a pretty, pretty slick little camera.
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:42.760]   So if you're looking for the next gen, this is, this is it right now.
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:43.760]   Oh man.
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:45.080]   I got me with my finger.
[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:46.080]   Please in the butt.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:47.080]   It's nifty.
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:48.880]   It's a lot of money.
[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:51.320]   Lisa uses a Brio on your recommendation.
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:53.840]   Uh, but she, and the Brio is still a great camera.
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:55.240]   We still, I don't think I would.
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:59.120]   If you don't move around, if you don't need to have all those other needs, a Brio.
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:00.120]   Yeah.
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:01.120]   And I think it's fine.
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:02.440]   And, and it, this is better.
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:05.880]   You can make little adjustments without having to go up to the UBC or whatever.
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:08.680]   It'll, it'll get you a better image.
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:13.600]   We're not ready to send out this to declines because it is, it is a little tricky.
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:15.880]   Like it's small and they could break it.
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:17.120]   Even packing it, they could break it.
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:21.640]   And so, so it is something that's more for someone who's really, this is your item.
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:24.560]   But, but I think that, and again, I think that what I'm really excited about is getting
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:30.880]   a couple of these opening up memo live by Boinks and, and playing with being able to
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:33.280]   cut between things relatively effectively.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:36.520]   So that's, that's the next thing we're going to play.
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:37.520]   Wow.
[02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:43.920]   Insta, which does a great 360 camera now has a, a desktop zoom camera.
[02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:47.560]   It's a very odd thing for them to jump into, but they really knocked it out of the park.
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:51.440]   What makes it again is you open up the software and the software is dramatically better.
[02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:57.400]   And the, the, the, the, the previous one, Logitech had okay software, never really, you know,
[02:29:57.400 --> 02:29:58.640]   the works on the Mac tweet.
[02:29:58.640 --> 02:30:00.960]   Obviously, and it works fine on the Mac.
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:01.960]   Yeah.
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:02.960]   As well as Windows, I presume.
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:03.960]   Yes.
[02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:04.960]   Yeah.
[02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:05.960]   It does.
[02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:06.960]   It does.
[02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:07.960]   Absolutely.
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:09.600]   And so, but the software is really, it's the control software that really makes the camera.
[02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:15.320]   This camera, this camera would be a big, can't even call it a door stop, a door jam.
[02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:19.400]   If, if they, if they hadn't really worked on the software and they've done a great job
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:20.400]   on the software as well.
[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:21.400]   Nice.
[02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:25.240]   Insta360 link is the name of it.
[02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:29.360]   And you can find it if you go to the Insta360.com website.
[02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:34.960]   And we've, I mean, it's been, it was like, cumulatively from the time it was announced,
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:39.800]   probably 20 or 25 questions in office hours, like everybody's buying them and talking about
[02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:40.800]   them.
[02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:41.800]   Yeah.
[02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:42.800]   We've seen a lot of coverage.
[02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:43.800]   Yeah.
[02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:44.800]   I didn't realize just needed it on that.
[02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:45.800]   Yeah.
[02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:46.800]   Should get a video.
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:47.800]   Yeah.
[02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:48.800]   Nice.
[02:30:48.800 --> 02:30:49.800]   Good pick.
[02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:50.800]   And find for form.
[02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:55.240]   I'm going to have to get a little extra in the pay packet for you there.
[02:30:55.240 --> 02:30:59.240]   Jason, Jason, don't spit it all at the bar.
[02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:02.920]   Jason Snell is at six colors.com.
[02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:03.920]   That's where he writes.
[02:31:03.920 --> 02:31:08.800]   But you know, you'll find him on many, many, many podcasts, which are all promoted on
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:09.800]   six colors.
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:10.800]   All the podcasts.
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:11.800]   All the podcasts.
[02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:12.800]   Anything you want to particularly highlight?
[02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:18.800]   No, check me out talking to Mike Hurley on upgrade on a good one.
[02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:19.800]   That's a good one.
[02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:20.800]   That's a good one.
[02:31:20.800 --> 02:31:21.800]   That's a good one.
[02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:22.800]   There are many, many podcasts.
[02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:23.800]   Relate.fm/upgrade.
[02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:25.600]   But that's just one of many.
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:30.800]   Also, the final update on the under table touch fingerprint button.
[02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:31.800]   Yeah.
[02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:34.400]   I mean, I gave everybody here that update last week, but there it is.
[02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:35.800]   It's there right now.
[02:31:35.800 --> 02:31:36.800]   It's a pretty thing.
[02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:37.800]   Touch ID.
[02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:40.800]   Apple should probably sell something else other than a keyboard with a touch ID thing on it.
[02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:41.800]   That'd be nice.
[02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:43.520]   By the way, the whole keyboard is in this box.
[02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:45.000]   That's what I 3D printed.
[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:46.600]   That's actually one of my two 3D printed things.
[02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:47.600]   Yeah.
[02:31:47.600 --> 02:31:48.600]   Okay.
[02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:49.600]   6colors.com.
[02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:50.600]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.600]   Always a pleasure.
[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:52.600]   Thank you, Michael.
[02:31:52.600 --> 02:31:56.600]   When is your next appearance on the fine GBH in Boston?
[02:31:56.600 --> 02:32:01.320]   It's going to be Thursday, 10 minutes to 1.
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:06.920]   Not in the library studio, but in zooming from home.
[02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:09.600]   So maybe I can justify getting that really good camera.
[02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:10.600]   Yeah.
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:11.600]   Charge it off to GBH.
[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:12.600]   They'll pay for it.
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:15.200]   We'll see how that works.
[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:16.200]   That's a good advice.
[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:17.920]   I'm definitely going to consider that.
[02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:22.960]   But go to wgphnews.org and you can watch the live stream live or you can stream it later
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:23.960]   on.
[02:32:23.960 --> 02:32:25.240]   Actually, that makes me think.
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:29.240]   I wondered for Christmas this year if we sent all our hosts the Insta360.
[02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:33.120]   Alex, do you think that would be a good use of our funds?
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:34.120]   Oh, yeah.
[02:32:34.120 --> 02:32:37.320]   We send you guys microphones so the audio is good.
[02:32:37.320 --> 02:32:39.480]   Let's maybe upgrade the cameras.
[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:41.480]   I got a Feds.
[02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:43.880]   Did you get a Feds one year?
[02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:44.880]   I have a Feds.
[02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:45.880]   I got a Feds.
[02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:52.120]   I forgot I could have brought the Feds on the cruises and had us all look like doofuses.
[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:54.240]   Feds was a lot of moves.
[02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:58.240]   I think that's what's called Gilding the Lily.
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:32:59.640]   Gilding the Lily.
[02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:00.640]   Thank you, sir.
[02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:01.640]   Thank you.
[02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:02.640]   You're absolutely right.
[02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:07.880]   Office Hours.global is where you'll find Alex Lindsey every morning doing amazing stuff.
[02:33:07.880 --> 02:33:11.280]   The rest of the day is at 090.media.
[02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:13.680]   What's going on at Office Hours this week?
[02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:15.440]   I'm really excited about it.
[02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:17.240]   Of course, the weeks are great.
[02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:18.240]   We're having a lot of.
[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:20.880]   We're talking about this tomorrow.
[02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:22.760]   Today we're talking about mics.
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:25.840]   Tomorrow Nick Joshician from Drexel University is coming back.
[02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:30.080]   He went to Sea Graph, so he's going to break down what he saw that was cool.
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:33.520]   We do this thing where we see something that we really like and we break it down.
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:37.440]   On Thursday morning, we're going to look at the ILM Light and Magic.
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:40.520]   We're going to just go through the frames and just go, "How are they framed?"
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:42.400]   It's not so much about it.
[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:45.240]   It's about that is a really good interview frame.
[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:50.440]   What do they do here and what is the detail and try to learn from what someone does that
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:51.920]   they spent obviously millions of dollars on.
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:54.560]   This is the Apple TV plus documentary on ILM.
[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:56.040]   It's Disney Plus.
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:57.040]   I'm sorry, Disney Plus.
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:33:58.480]   It should have been Apple Plus.
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:00.480]   Disney Plus, of course.
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:01.480]   And really amazing.
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:04.640]   Lawrence Kasdan directed it and it's just so good.
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:05.640]   Absolutely.
[02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:09.200]   In Friday, one of the other things we do is we do a lot of transparent production.
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:13.520]   So Friday, we're talking about what we're going to do with IBC is like NAB in Europe.
[02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:19.560]   There is, I think there's going to be 40 people working on it on the coverage for IBC,
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:21.200]   only for a couple hours.
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:23.280]   But there's like 10 people that will be on the ground.
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:28.080]   There's like 20 or 30 people that are offsite that are doing edits and graphics and cutting
[02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:29.920]   the show and so on and so forth.
[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:33.440]   We're going to talk about where that is and what we're doing on Friday.
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:36.760]   Then the other thing I'm really excited about is this thing we're doing with Michael Krasney
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:38.840]   that was formerly from KQED.
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:39.840]   How are these conversations?
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:40.840]   Good.
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:41.840]   We had Amber on a couple weeks ago.
[02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:42.840]   Oh, nice.
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:46.320]   We had an epronomeron that was just, I mean, every one of these conversations is just
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:47.320]   amazing.
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:48.600]   Where can we find that?
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:49.600]   The Krasney podcast.
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:50.600]   That's it.
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:51.600]   That's a gray matter.
[02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:54.960]   It can be, it's EY, but you could probably mistype it and it would still work.
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:58.720]   Graymatter.show online and you'll see the list of the people.
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:00.040]   I mean, we've had the president.
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:03.240]   I mean, Michael's, Michael's Rolodex is very deep.
[02:35:03.240 --> 02:35:11.160]   So we had the president of council for foreign affairs, which I've been reading.
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:12.480]   Foreign affairs for a long time.
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:15.080]   So council foreign relations was a big deal.
[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:18.280]   But Amber's interview was incredible.
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:23.000]   We're just getting a couple of these, just starting to come out and each one of them is
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.640]   just really been really, really interesting.
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:30.160]   All you have to do is go up there, sign up for the podcast and you'll start getting
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:31.160]   it.
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:33.240]   We allow people to listen to the live version.
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:35.480]   Some folks in office hours right now are doing it.
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:40.520]   Eventually, we'll open it up to a wider group, which is that you can listen and ask questions.
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:44.720]   So like a third of the show are people that are listening to the show asking questions.
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:48.760]   And so it's, but Michael is a pretty good interviewer.
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:52.200]   It's just, it's just like the, if you were in the Bay Area, it's just like the radio show
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:53.200]   for decades.
[02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:56.400]   He's like, we're like getting already, getting already.
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:35:58.040]   And then he just goes, welcome to Graymatter.
[02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:00.160]   And it's just like, it is exactly like form.
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:01.120]   Nice.
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:03.800]   It's just very, very smooth and clean and it's great.
[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:05.480]   That's, that's what we're doing.
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:06.480]   Thank you all three of you.
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:08.600]   We do Mac break weekly on a Tuesday.
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:15.120]   If I get here in time 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC, I say the live time
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:16.640]   so you can watch live if you want.
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:17.640]   You don't have to.

[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:00.360]   It's really excellent and a great place to hang out.
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:01.400]   That's free.
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:06.800]   We also have Twit.social which is our mastodon instance in a place we also can hang out if

[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:20.840]   And iCloud is now back according to scooter X and the system status page.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:21.840]   Yay.

[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:32.720]   Wait a second.
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:35.640]   Is that an Apple watch on your wrist?
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:38.720]   And do I see an iPad sitting there on the table?
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:40.120]   Oh my goodness.
