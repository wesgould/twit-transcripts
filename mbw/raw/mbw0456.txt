[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest up for news.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   When it's that much up for news to talk about today, we welcome to the panel as always, Mr. I shouldn't take this for granted.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Mr. Andy Anacow. I may say as always, but we are thrilled that each and every time I turn to my left and I see your smiling face.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I'm just very grateful for this weekly scheduled two hours in which I know that I have to be able to be able to use my words.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And from the safety of not having a physical face to face interaction with the human, I still get a chance to test out the social software.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   It's like an error rate siren. I don't like to be able to use my social software.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Occasionally you just got to blow that horn to make sure it's still working.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And this is my chance to keep the larynx, the tongue, everything like limbered up in a good operation case.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Paul Schafer said he's going to miss the fact that he knows what he needs to know exactly what he was going to be doing every day at 4pm.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You have to take a shower once a day.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Hey, that's Renee Richie. I'm more.com. Great to see you Renee.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Thank you Leo.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah, and you've shaved my beard because I couldn't compete with Mike.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   But I also want to thank and congratulate Andy on his new title of Chief Cyber and Officer.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Those better never go away, Andrew.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I've got it. Well, actually, I accidentally, I did the few months ago, I did the rookie move of the beer trimmer that I use.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It usually has the attachment that keeps the sideburns the right length.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I had removed it so that I could do some other grooming, forgot to put it back on.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And then two days later, just like, okay, so this puts like without sideburns for the first time in 20 years.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   We'll see how that works.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Fortunately, you're sued enough that it didn't really.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I think though during the commercial, I'm going to have to go up.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I forgot that I forgot to shave this.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Shave a little more. I look like a bum.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I'm going to have to do a hair.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I don't feel as though I have the credit. I have the credibility of it.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   It's like Renee is fine because Steve Jobs is fine.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   There are these people that like the stubble makes them look dashing.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I just look like, oh, look who decided he'd much rather sleep an extra six minutes in the morning rather than actually through.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You've got a whole ring thing going on, Andy.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Total Wolverine thing going on.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I love it.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And I'm like a stainless steel arrived.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Well, I know. Let's let me introduce Mike and then we'll talk about it.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Speaking of beards, Mike Hurley is here from relay.fm.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Hey, Mike.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It was great to be back. Thank you so much having me today.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Mike with a why.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You Britstone. You have a new you call ZZ.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   You don't have a strange way of saying why do you.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   G. No, we don't like the heat.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You should why you might as well get the whole alphabet while you're at it.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Why just one letter is on.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It is on.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Okay. Thanks.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   The Romans.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It is ours, you know.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Why is it?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   American say see and every other culture English speaking culture in the world says that why.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Is that cultural deviance?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Do you say you say Z in Canada too, right?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Yeah. And we have a you after I was like all good, hard, colorful people.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   What is it? Oh, actually, I know about the use that really goes back to the days of the founding fathers where they decided we're not going to do it the way those Brits do it.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Who was it?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   They kept the PHS, but they got rid of you as it's a very strange.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Well, we're not Zeds, but I use that a lot because Z frankly is ambiguous a little bit sometimes.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I can be.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Could be.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Could be.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I just fell asleep.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Well, that is dead.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Johnny I've kicked upstairs chief design officer.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   The announcement was I think originally made by Stephen Fry and an interesting but quite discursive article in on the telegraph.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And then a memo came out from Tim cook confirming that Johnny I've is now chief design officer.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Not sure how that well, I guess he doesn't do hands on because of his managerial duties.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   All the stuff that I've read indicates that it's more of a now he can be just be this free floating cloud of design that descends that floats over the entire planet of Apple stuff, including retail.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And just simply descends to rain design upon something and doesn't have to like, Oh, and now we need someone needs their 1099 countersign.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah, there's other people who can do that now.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   It's just basically how and how many times should the fork in the new Apple cafeteria on the spaceship campus be right now.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It was like three really different reactions.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   One from the people who are optimistic was, wow, he's finally ascending.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   He's shedding all those managerial duties.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   He doesn't like and he can focus entirely on design.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   The pessimists were like, well, this is his first foot out of the door.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   He's giving over his responsibilities.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   He's not going to be at Apple forever.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And then the analysts were like, Oh, super clever way for Apple to hide his salary because he has no management duties on a policy maker.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And there's no disclosure needed under FCC guidelines.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Oh, that's an interesting twist on all of that.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Yeah, Richard, what was his, do you know what his salary is until July 1st?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   They haven't reported it since 2009, even though it looks like they should have because he had managerial duties when he was promoted to see him.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   He was promoted to senior vice president.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And I forget what it was.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It was one of the people on Forbes was saying that there was probably negotiation going back and forth with the FCC saying,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   SCC, SCC, SCC, SCC, yeah, saying that, well, you have them on your corporate front page and that's not matching your disclosure statements.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And he does have all these direct reports and that's not matched and that is a policy making job.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And maybe they decided to move him out before that became the issue.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Why hide it?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Is it because it's like $40 million?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It's competitive. It's competitive information. They said it's like the highest paid trader at a hedge fund.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   He's not an officer of the company, but he's one of the most valuable assets of that company.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   You don't need to know what Johnny makes to know Johnny is critical to Apple.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   He's just as poachable now as ever.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Yeah, but no one has no good option.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   But who could poach him, right, Mike?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Like, there's, I don't think it's the name of money.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Like the guy probably owns quite a chunk of stock in Apple.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   So the money is just going to build forever.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   But you've got to have a, like, there has to be a reason that you would want to join your company.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And as a designer, what better job is there than his?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Isn't he or Lego?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I've heard some interesting.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Lego!
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I don't see Johnny.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I've, oh, that's, that's the ultimate thing.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   You talk about quick turnaround prototyping.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   There's Lego and there's nothing else.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   The thinnest bricks we've ever made.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Richard, how worth it is.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Richard, how worth it is.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Richard, how worth it is.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Richard, how worth it is.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Or how worth will become VP of industrial design.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That means he's hardware design.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   He, he's part of the original iPhone team.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Alan, this concerns me a little bit more.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   First of all, I was concerned when they say Johnny was in charge of software.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   That worried me a little bit.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Alan Dye is now going to be VP user interface design.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   That's both desktop and mobile devices.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   That's software.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.

[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And then we're going to be working on it.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And gold come with an stainless here.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   The stainless comes with a plastic box that is absolutely not recyclable.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I mean, it's exactly the opposite.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   It's beautiful packaging.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I'm not saying that.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   But it is not reducing.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's not disposable.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   If you're charging that kind of money for a watch, it's crazy stupid.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I just threw out my plastic box.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   What am I going to do with that?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Well, I mean, even the sport is a charger.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   This is just the outer sarcophagus.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And then you go inside here.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   I mean, again, it's in my unboxing video, which I haven't posted yet.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   But it's like King Tut was not packaged as beautiful, as beautifully as this thing was.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   But it's wasteful.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It's a perception of the value.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Well, OK, you can also say that $900 for a gadget watch with a $150 watch band.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   That's kind of wasteful too.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   He was a Kate Spade, by the way.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Here's our yes.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It's so smooth.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   You could just sleep on it.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   It would be a.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I just could be a nice pillow.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I'm so sorry.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   As I'm unpacking this, I'm thinking, I need to find something that I own that's this shape.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I know.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   That is the perfect set.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Like tennis balls.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Watch balls.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I kept buying for almost a month.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And finally, this morning, we had two of them recycled it because I thought, it's just sitting
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   in my office.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   It's not doing anything.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   I bet you could have sold it, Leo.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I'm not even joking.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   The box.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I thought you put that up for sale.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Someone would have bought the box.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   I'm not joking.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Anyway, he was at Kate Spade.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And he did.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And I think he'll be glad to see this.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Unless this is an ad, he designed the Molson Beer logo, Mr. Renee Richie.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.320]   Now, how do you feel?
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.000]   I feel 10% happier.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.160]   I get to be made for 12.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.960]   He was at Olga V and Mather in their brand integration group.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.120]   He was at Landor Associates, which is here in San Francisco.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.760]   And that's where he, unless that's just a small part of the division.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.560]   Nothing but really good things about him, especially at his recent role in Apple.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:26.120]   But I wonder, how does physical design, and admittedly, he's great at boxes and Molson
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.720]   logos, but how does that help you with UI?
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.920]   UI, I'm sorry.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.440]   I'm an old-fashioned guy.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:37.680]   UI is a very specific kind of design that is not the same thing as designing industrial
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.880]   artifacts.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.320]   It is software.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:51.000]   It is, and Apple, by the way, was born, the DNA of Apple is, started with the Mac OS UI
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.480]   guidelines that were really great.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.880]   I mean, really specific.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.480]   And they've drifted far, far away from those.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.880]   If you go back further, though, it was Steve Jobs' fascination with typography.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.720]   And I know I started off in print design before I went into digital design.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.600]   I know Mark Edwards from Bajango was in print design first.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.000]   There's a lot of people who bring their love of typography and design and layout and white
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.160]   space and all these things and just express it in a digital medium.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.080]   And I think that's part of what Johnny wanted was that sort of a take on iOS.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.080]   That's fine.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.440]   And it's great for static documents, but UI design is not static documents.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.560]   It is something very special.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.000]   There would be people who are saying that design is design is design, that the basic
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.960]   principle designers make.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:37.400]   Well, or professionals who work in that job.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.880]   The fact that they're not simply dictating how something is going to look, but they're
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.880]   working hand in hand with engineers that at that level, at that corporate level, have
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.800]   been designed to simply push back at any bad ideas.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.700]   Given that every designer has a lowercase engineering qualification on their business
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.040]   card, and every engineer has a lowercase design qualification on his or her business
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.600]   card, you're basically looking for someone who thinks the right way as opposed to someone
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.920]   who has the right tech sort of product development in their portfolio.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.840]   Once they get to Apple, they're going to have to relearn how corporate structure and how
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.080]   to product development works.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.000]   Anyway, you may as well get a brain that's already round us going to fit in that round
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   hole.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.120]   Look, nobody complains about Apple's typefaces or use of white space.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   Francisco.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.040]   We're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:28.000]   But I have, in the last few years, been very unhappy with Apple's direction with UI.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.800]   I feel like it's gone the wrong way.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:39.160]   By the way, Andy just sent me a link to a original packaging box only eBay listing.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.680]   50 bucks.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.280]   I just threw out a hundred bucks worth of boxes.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.280]   Well, you had this.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.320]   You had the, you had the, you had the, you had the stainless steel when we last played
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   200 bucks.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.120]   There is a two like to recall the recycling bin.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.040]   There hasn't, there hasn't been any bids on that one, but I'm continuing to like do
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040]   searches.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.520]   And here's one that there's already four bids up to 10 bucks.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.040]   Here's another one with the box.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.040]   It's free.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   People are fans.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.040]   People are fans.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.040]   Apple.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.640]   I should have wrapped them up and given the empty boxes to my kids for Christmas.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.360]   The one, the one thing you can definitely say you will def, unlike the, unlike the contents,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.920]   you will definitely be able to use that box in two years.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.320]   So maybe it's the better value.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   So am I wrong?
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.840]   Mike, let me ask you, am I wrong?
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.600]   Does Apple's UI design really kind of, has it kind of gone downhill?
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.840]   Is it less usable than it was in the early 1984 Mac?
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.320]   For instance, I'll give you an example and then you can answer.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.000]   I'm not through talking.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.360]   There was a concept, and this, by the way, came from early research, Alan Kay and others
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.400]   at Xerox Park at SRI in something, they called it monotony.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.800]   The idea that there should be one and only one way to do everything because the brain
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.200]   paths learn that way and everything will be easier and that operate.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   And this is, well, to me, one of the reasons I prefer to attend a Windows because in Windows
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   is exactly opposite.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.920]   There should be 53 different ways of doing anything.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.880]   Many of them would involve obstrus keystrokes.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   The idea that there was this pure path, modal dialogues were eschewed because modality,
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.000]   man, it stopped you from being able to work.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.640]   And all of those things I think have been thrown out completely.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.600]   All right, now you may speak.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.280]   I just, I wanted, I had to get up on my soapbox.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.520]   I feel like it's not as easy to use as it was.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.800]   I think it's difficult as these products are getting a lot more complex that maybe it's
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.760]   time that Apple relooks at some things.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.240]   I know from like a taste perspective, I don't like the transparency stuff in Yosemite.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.000]   I turn that off.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.320]   That's just not something that I like.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.280]   I do like the overall look of iOS 7/IOSA.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:48.680]   I think that that is nice to look at and I find easier to maybe not necessarily to understand.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   But you may understand me.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.160]   I'm not debating the look, the typeface choice, the buttons.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.720]   I'm debating usability.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   That's where I think it's all down.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   Affordance.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   Thank you.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.000]   That's the word.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.040]   I think it's just a lot more complex now.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.800]   And I think that that is a user experience and user interface problem.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.280]   And I think that that is something that is difficult to fight because we want more from
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.720]   our devices, which means they will get more complex.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.480]   And I guess part of it is in the decisions that are made.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.600]   And it might be down to individual users in the way that they like to do things.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.840]   And the types of controls and settings that they want to have.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   I don't know.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840]   It is difficult.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840]   It is more difficult.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.760]   But I think it's going to naturally be more difficult if these things get more powerful.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   I'll grant you that.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.800]   I mean, that's why it's so important to have good UI designers because you have to look
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.320]   at what Microsoft did with the ribbon.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.160]   I mean, Office became so complicated that people were only using 5% of the features
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.400]   because they didn't even know they existed.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.080]   And then they did this ribbon thing, which is debatable, whether that was good or bad.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.160]   Now, it's hamburgers and basements for everybody.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.360]   You use the word affordance.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.880]   What is, can you define that, Renee?
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.320]   So affordance is a user interface term, but it means the action is hinted by what it is.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.640]   For example, a doorknob you look at it, you know to turn it.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.520]   It's got a high level of affordance.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.720]   With the original versions of iOS, they also wanted a very high level of affordance.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.320]   So the slides unlock.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.400]   Nobody knew really what that was.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.160]   So they made this big graphical groove and put a big slider on it.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.120]   So that it looked like a real world object.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:40.520]   That's what house
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:56.960]   to do.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:26.840]   And I think that Apple's in the kind of an unusual situation in which they're not
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.440]   like, they're not building their products the way that Google is trying to deploy Android
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.640]   towards multiple platforms.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.280]   They're not like Microsoft.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.000]   That's finally trying to unify the windows experience across multiple devices.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.800]   They really do want to have a consistent language that they can apply to everywhere.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.840]   Something that really got promoted a lot on social media was they're making the design
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.880]   book for the New York subway system.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.280]   When they redesigned the subway system, I think it was in the 60s, maybe that they're
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.080]   going to have all the signage be completely consistent and they had to make sure that
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.920]   no matter where these instructions are, whether it's on a post, whether it's on a printed
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.960]   material, whether it's on something like that, it has to be consistent so that every
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.200]   time someone sees this language, they don't know what the content is, but they know what
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.440]   it's related to and they know that that's where they're going to get their information
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   from.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.040]   I think that Apple's facing the exact same problem where they're not as disposed as other
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.240]   companies are to say, well, this is a watch.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.240]   So we're going to have to make it more what we're going to do something special for the
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.880]   watch or we're going to do something special for the iPad or we're going to do something
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.240]   special for our desktop interface.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.680]   We really want to have one language that's consistent across so many different experiences
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.040]   that it's hard to optimize for any one sort of device.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.560]   So there are areas in which I agree with you.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:48.120]   I'm on day, I think, 12 or 11 of using the Apple watch and there's still some basic user
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.720]   interface elements that I feel as though I don't understand.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.680]   I think I'm still learning the language of what the user interface wants to tell me and
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.440]   how I should say things back to it.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.240]   But it's a large scale problem and I think that it's not good.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.040]   I really do think that Apple is going to have to keep their head down and make a whole bunch
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.240]   of mistakes before they can solve it.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.840]   It's only when they put these things out in front of millions of people and they figure
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.720]   out here is what people are reacting to, here is what people are picking up immediately.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.680]   Well, I mean, just to wind it up.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:25.280]   I mean, I'm amazed that Apple has put so much attention towards digital crown and I could
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.680]   definitely see again in that three ring binder that explains the design process of why they
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.720]   decided to make this part of the language.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.160]   It makes perfect sense.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.200]   But nonetheless, I almost never use it.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.440]   For me, it's just a clicky button that takes me to the Apple launcher because every time
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.800]   I want to scroll something, I'm always doing this because that's what I do on all these
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.800]   other devices that I am.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   I'm scrolling it wrong.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.400]   Yeah, so I usually assume that whenever there's a lack of understanding, it's because I'm
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   a dope.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.000]   It's not always right, but it's overuse.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.040]   Don't you see that your big fat figure is obscuring the screen and the only real way
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.080]   to scroll is through the ground?
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.240]   I don't want to mock them.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.520]   I do think that's an example of the loss of monotony, the fact that there are two ways
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   to do it.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.200]   Yeah, I think it's going to be interesting to see a year from now when Apple has the idea
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.240]   that has the ability to not only do the next version of the watch operating system, but
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   also to do the next version of the watch hardware.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.200]   I'm not expecting this to be radically different.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.520]   I'm not expecting to see a round Apple watch, but I think that they're going to listen to
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.520]   a lot of what people are telling them and what people, when they've got these wired
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.480]   up devices that let them see what are people gravitating towards?
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.440]   What are people not gravitating towards?
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.480]   I'm sorry, I'm blathering on, but it's such an interesting topic.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.240]   I noticed that now you see a lot of people who are wearing it with the digital crown
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.280]   on the outside and not the inside, even though you're sort of taught that on a watch that
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.360]   the crown should go towards your fingers.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.720]   I think it was Hockenberry, who was the first one to really talk about this a lot, that
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   a lot of people find that once they start wearing this upside down, it's a more natural
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.920]   place to put that button.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.160]   It's easier to grab it.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.520]   It's easier to sort of brace the other side with the other two fingers as you're tapping.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.160]   So many things that Apple's not going to figure out until millions of people are using this
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   device.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.000]   Credit to Apple, they make that easy to do.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.400]   Is there anybody doing better?
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.400]   I guess would be the question.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   There's one thing that I was hard to add to Andy's comment because Apple, in a way, Apple
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.240]   is different.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   Microsoft wants to put that one metro interface across everything.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.640]   They wanted to work on computers, on tablets, on phones.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:32.000]   Google wants to have material design working on the web, on Chromebooks, in Chrome, and
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.240]   on Android.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.480]   Well, Alan Dye is leading all this.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.720]   The people who designed Yosemite were different than the people who designed iOS 7.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.640]   And the people working on the watch team were different as well.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.720]   And they didn't, they wanted them to have a similar feel in some ways.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.880]   Like there's similar concepts behind them.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.960]   But Yosemite is actually quite different than iOS 7.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.760]   It's got shadows and depths and different design criteria.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.600]   And the watch also has different criteria.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.880]   They want to build specifically for the device in many ways.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.640]   And to Andy's point, the watch is brand new.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.840]   And they had a lot of people, thousands of people inside Apple using it for months before
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   they released it.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.200]   And they changed it a lot over that time.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.760]   But it's only going to be those millions and millions of people hitting it that show
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.200]   them where the actual rough points are.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   It's civilians.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   We have the problem with you.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   Yes.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.600]   Thousands of people that Apple has trusted and people who work for Apple as opposed to.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.480]   The finest test that any of us, we're trying to figure out, get an opinion that's useful
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.480]   to other people, is when you are at a Panera bread.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.120]   And this is the first time someone has seen an Apple watch.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.480]   And they want to see how it works.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.320]   And they actually want to put it on their own wrist.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.400]   And you see at what point do they go?
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.080]   Because they thought someone would, something would work one way, but it doesn't.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.520]   That's the only user testing that's really going to refine and prove the concept.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.920]   I, in some ways, I feel like, I don't want to, people are going to get mad at me when
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.720]   I say this.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.960]   Android wears taking advantage of Google's decision to go with cards.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.960]   Yes.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.880]   And I feel like cards is an interesting choice.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.240]   Do you think it works as well?
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.080]   Or to me, I feel like it works better.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.640]   It was designed for that purpose.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.560]   The guy who designed it meant for it to be able to scale from things like the phone to
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.720]   the watch that was its intended purpose.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.000]   It's, I mean, I'm only on day 11.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.360]   I'm only on day 12.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.280]   I'm not at a point where I'm comfortable reaching any conclusions about Apple watch yet.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.920]   One thing that I do miss from Android where is the simplicity and the directness of this
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.960]   card concept where I never feel as though I have to drill down to get information.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:36.720]   I don't feel as though I ever have to interact with this piece of software anymore than is
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   critically important for me to interact with it to get this sort of thing.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.840]   It's an interesting, it's, there are limitations.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.280]   I mean, it's not, I also sometimes feel like, God, I want to swipe 15 more cards to get
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.440]   to what I'm looking for.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.920]   I wish, I mean, I wish that once there is a notification, I wish that there were an easier
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.160]   way to say, okay, I'm done with this notification.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.160]   Never want to see it again.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.920]   I wish there were a really easy and trivial way to get rid of it.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.680]   I haven't found it yet.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:07.320]   I have this in about a week, I start actually reading reading the how to book, I'm reading
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.040]   the, the, the reviewers guide that I have.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.920]   For the first two weeks, I just want to sort of figure it out on my own.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.800]   I'm just, there's something as simple as that.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.040]   I'm a little surprised that I don't know how to get rid of a notification that doesn't
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.840]   involve surfacing a dismiss button and then tapping that button.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.680]   Nobody's, this is new.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.040]   This is the smallest interface we've ever had to deal with.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.880]   And everybody's trying different things.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   Uh, Microsoft.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.440]   And they have to satisfy two agendas, people who want it super simple and people who want
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.120]   a high level functionality.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.600]   But that's the really hard problem that we expect Apple to solve.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.160]   I could tell you one thing right now, I, I, for four seconds, I tried the crown on the
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.480]   left Andy and I hate it.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.480]   So I've moved it back.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   Okay.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   It's the same thing.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   I feel like you have to brace either way.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   It's easy to change.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   I'm good.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480]   It's, it's like what once this is why I keep saying, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.800]   like, this is, this is why I keep saying to myself and others that you can't really trust
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.680]   any opinion of the Apple watch that comes before at least two to three weeks of use because
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.640]   I do, I do have my, my Evernote.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.360]   I have like a long, long list of like impressions pro and con and it's easy to see in the first
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.320]   two, three, four days, every single thing that drove me up a tree about it is like,
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.480]   okay, let's go into the app and on the phone and see, oh, yeah, there is a way to turn
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.480]   that off.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.480]   Okay.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   There is a way to turn that off.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   Okay.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:26.080]   So, I still haven't read any reviews, but I imagine that once I start reading them, I'm
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.000]   going to see a lot of, yeah, you really should have given it another day.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   I took three weeks.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   I took three weeks, Andy.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.520]   So hopefully it won't be that bad.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.480]   And do I never read the reviewer guy because I feel like that's the, that's an advantage
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.040]   that we get that others don't.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.240]   Well, but then, then again, I, I feel as though I need to have a clean consumer experience
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.480]   for my, for my getting acquainted period at the time where I'm actually writing the review,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.920]   though, it's very, very handy.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.200]   So I accept that this is, I accept that it's controversial because, because again, it's
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.760]   information that I'm getting that the consumer is in.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.320]   But nonetheless, if there's a feature that I was unaware of, that's important enough
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.320]   that the company says, look, here is, here is, here is how we believe that this phone
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.360]   or this device or this computer should work.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.560]   Here's who we designed it for.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.040]   And here's what our imperatives were as we designed it.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   That can clarify things a lot.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:19.360]   And so it's, this is why I really do, most consumers also don't get, you know, 45 minutes
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   from the CEO of the company or one of the chief designers of the device.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.120]   But that's time where I can say, look, you tell me the story of this.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.680]   What were you going, what was going through your mind?
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.480]   What did you think was really, really important about it?
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.360]   And that's where a lot of things become a lot more clear.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:38.240]   You feel as though if you're, if you're complaining about Jimmy Fallon is not as good an interviewer
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:44.440]   as, as Lebron was or isn't quite as sharp a wit, you realize that, oh, well, the point
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.840]   is not for to have host interactions.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.160]   It's for prepared comedy and for sketches and things that are easy to, easy to assimilate.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.880]   It's like, okay, in that case, I'm not going to say he's bad.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.760]   I'm simply saying it's a different style of comedy.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   It's all about getting to the clip.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.760]   Come on, face it.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.760]   We're going to take a break.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.760]   Come back with more.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.760]   Andy and Akko's here from the Chicago.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.680]   Sometimes one of the things I appreciate that you, Andy and I love is you really spend
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:11.240]   time thinking about your job and what best way to do it.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.240]   And so it's always great.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.080]   Well, I will only say that I'm inspired by Roger Ebert.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.920]   I'm inspired by David Letterman.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.800]   I want to be doing this for many more decades.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.240]   And when the ball game is all over, I want people to see that, okay, he was here is the
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.120]   body of work he created and none of it was terribly bad.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.680]   So that's unfortunately, that's what you have to do.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:34.960]   Also here, I'm really glad to have Mr. Renee Richie from I gave Andy props for showing
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   up for every show.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.520]   You do the same and I'm so grateful that you're a regular on this from imore.com with the
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.640]   smartest guys in the business.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.520]   And first, I think your second time, right?
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   Mike Hurley from relay FM.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.520]   Second.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.520]   We got to make it.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.520]   We got to do it more than that.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.680]   It's great to have you as well.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.680]   We are talking Apple.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.440]   We're going to talk San Francisco font.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.040]   The new font is here.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.840]   And just a second.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:03.480]   I knew there's a reason why the kids were in the street laughing and cheering.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.160]   But first a word from trunk club.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.160]   It's pretty clear.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:12.520]   I think that most not all some guys like to shop Andy loves shopping for his fishermen's
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.200]   whatever the hell jacket was last week.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.920]   But and by the way, I've been trying to find one of my size and I can't because I want
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   one too.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.000]   Thank goodness, though.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.440]   I have a stylist now.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.680]   She probably say, you know, you might want to think about wearing the Safari helmet and
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.400]   the fifth jacket or whatever it is.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:37.520]   Trunk club gave me a new way of shopping that is fun, zero work, great advice, premium
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.480]   clothing and it's free.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   So all so what happened?
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.880]   I signed up for trunk club and Robin, my wonderful stylist and I spent about half an
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.160]   hour on the phone talking about my style, my size.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.160]   I was blunt.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.200]   I'm fat.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.280]   And all the everything she needed to know to help me pick great clothes.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.720]   That conversation was not hard work.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.880]   That was fun.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.520]   Then she put up a website with like a hot or not thing on clothing that I got to pick
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.480]   what I liked and not that helped her narrow it down.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.200]   Then I got my trunk.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.200]   The sound comes.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.480]   By the way, you will never get a trunk you don't expect.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.800]   This is not like every month I get a new trunk.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   No.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.440]   You talk to your stylist.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.160]   She says, you know, you tell her, I'm ready for another trunk.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   Thank you, John.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.160]   Appreciate it.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.160]   And then the new trunk clubs.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.360]   All right, I'm excited.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.360]   I'm excited.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.160]   By the way, you only pay for the clothes you keep.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.440]   So I hadn't paid for the trunk.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.680]   I didn't pay for her time.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.600]   I didn't pay for anything in this trunk.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.200]   When you're done trying it on, you got 10 days to try it on.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.760]   You ship back the stuff you want.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.760]   You don't want.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.800]   You keep only the stuff you keep is the stuff you pay for.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.880]   So here it is, my new trunk.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.880]   I'm so excited.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.880]   I don't know how I could show you this though.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   This is so big.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.160]   Oh, there's a message from Robin.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.280]   There's a packing list and return instructions.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.640]   Prepaid return label.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.640]   They even-- isn't this nice?
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.520]   They give me replacement tape.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.880]   And they give me three because they know I'm kind of a doofus.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:07.720]   And so here's what we got today.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.160]   A Harrington Jockert.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.680]   Oh, look at these are beautiful.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.080]   They tie them up with these beautiful ribbons.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   This is like Christmas every time a new trunk club comes.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.960]   Oh, oh, she started to do bow ties.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.120]   I said, I want bow ties.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.160]   Ooh, that-- you know what?
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.880]   I might-- I'm going to put this on the day.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.920]   I'm going to wear this today.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.280]   I like this tie.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.120]   Neck ties, shirts from the best makers.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.560]   This is Connecticut American sports wear from New Haven.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.800]   Did you tell her I went to school in New Haven?
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.520]   Look at that.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.600]   Oh, Lisa, you helped?
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.160]   Oh, Lisa gave her.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.480]   That's the other thing your wife can talk to your stylist
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.160]   and say, look at this.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:48.960]   This is pretty.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.760]   I love this.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.640]   So here's the idea.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.520]   Now, I'm going to try these all on.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.720]   They're all in my sizes.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.080]   Sometimes Robin has included two.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.680]   Like two different jackets says, which one fits better?
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.200]   She'll keep track of that information.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.960]   So from then on, she knows.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.400]   Oh, I'm loving.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.120]   Oh, feel that.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.680]   Anyway, OK.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.560]   You don't need to watch me try this stuff on.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.040]   You get the point.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:09.840]   Great stuff.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.000]   She picks it for me.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.120]   I try it on 10 days.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:13.920]   I keep what I want.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.320]   I send back what I don't.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.960]   Postage paid.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.160]   That's it.

[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:25.080]   You got to look good for your girl or for your job
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.920]   or just for yourself.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.080]   Only pay for what you keep.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.880]   There's no ongoing subscription, no hidden charges.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.280]   Just great clothes handpicked for you.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.480]   Trunkclub.com/twit.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.440]   And I'm keeping this boat.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.160]   I'm putting this boat down now.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.320]   Now.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.760]   We thank them for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.040]   Oh, this is so pretty.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.840]   Look at that.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.320]   That is sharp.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.800]   And look at the even the lining is--
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.720]   whoa!
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.480]   This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.880]   These are pretty 100% silk.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.880]   Look at that.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.760]   What do you think, Lisa?
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.480]   Can I put that on?
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.320]   Oh, it's reversible.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.080]   Oh, my God.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:03.680]   It's both.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.160]   I actually picked that one off.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.160]   Which do you think Paisley or Dotz today?
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.040]   I like Paisley.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.200]   All right.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.640]   Paisley's going on.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.400]   Back we go to San Francisco, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.680]   and the new typeface for the Apple Watch.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.760]   Is this going to be the typeface for more than the Watch?
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.880]   Is this OS X now?
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.880]   It's going to be everything.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.360]   Everything.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:25.880]   Everything.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.880]   I mean, they worked on Apple.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.840]   There was rumors of them working on Apple's songs
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.600]   for a long time.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.520]   I don't know what relationship, if any, this has.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.080]   This might be a derivative or something
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:33.920]   based on Apple's songs.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.120]   Or it could be something they like better than Apple's songs.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.040]   But it's something they've been moving towards for a while,
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.640]   sort of having that distinctive Apple-owned look
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.520]   to their software.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.520]   Right.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.320]   Right.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.920]   What do you think?
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.040]   This has been Lovejoy in the '95 Mac.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.400]   Let me describe some of the features of this Dufa.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.320]   The moderate aperture double story form with flat topped
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   bowl on the A, the flat middle apex
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.760]   diagonals meet a little above the baseline and the capital M.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.320]   The large X height makes it legible even in small sizes.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.800]   Type designers are a different breed, aren't they?
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.640]   Thank goodness.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.680]   Minimal contrast, straight stress angle, stroke
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.320]   is thinner in intersections.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.200]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.080]   See, you never noticed that.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:14.920]   Look at the H.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.800]   They have legibility problems to solve Leo.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.120]   Yeah, because it's tiny.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.120]   Large I.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:23.560]   I don't know.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.520]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.000]   This is, for instance, look at the E, the lower case E.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.400]   This is how you solve that issue of small, small type
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.200]   by making a large gap between the bottom stroke of the E
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.120]   and the top edge there makes it more apparently an E.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.800]   Single story G.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.240]   Oh, he would want a double story G. Interesting.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   I don't know.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.960]   I think it's actually quite lovely.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.520]   The designer Wen Ting Zhang.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.880]   All right.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.400]   It's so hard for me to-- every time I see--
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.320]   I will not make fun of these articles
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.320]   that talk about a font in such close detail.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.800]   Because I recognize that these people
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.040]   have an understanding of something that I do not have.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.880]   To me, it still comes down to pretty or not pretty,
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.760]   or works for this device, does not work for this device.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.760]   And so everybody is an expert on something.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.360]   And usually there is a very, very fine point
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.200]   on every pencil you can pick up.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.320]   It's just interesting that Android had Roboto and Microsoft
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.400]   to forget how you pronounce it.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.880]   Segau or Segoe or something like that.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.040]   They had the company that prided itself on bringing typography
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.480]   to the real age didn't have their own typeface.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.400]   Now they didn't--
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.840]   Well, they did have a San Francisco.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.960]   As you well remember from the first time back in time,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.800]   they didn't have a modern--
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.120]   Yeah, a modern company.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.200]   Wow, that is a good look at tie.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.360]   Unlike in that--
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.920]   Oh, you're using Apple--
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.240]   Apple-- what's it called?
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.560]   And then Apple myriad and then Helvetica Neu.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.560]   What's the San Francisco?
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.840]   Original San Francisco font.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.040]   So different.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.720]   I forgot what it looked like.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.680]   It was a display because it's crazy.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   Eclactic.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.680]   Eclactic.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.560]   So this is a great site.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.160]   Type detail.com.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.880]   Is this Apple site or--
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.920]   No, it's just a site where it shows off typed.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.880]   And then you can see all the different ways it looks.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.320]   Not crazy about the choice of microfages as the word.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.680]   Macrofages, aren't those like disease?
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.480]   That gives you a lot of letters to look at.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.360]   Yes.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.640]   I like San Francisco.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.320]   I wouldn't mind seeing it, especially on the iPhone.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.080]   It's quite crisp looking.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.080]   I like it.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.880]   I like the small caps as well.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   It's pretty.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.720]   It's nice to look at.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:47.520]   And as well, we're not going to see an iOS 7 like UI design
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.200]   overhaul in a long time.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.120]   But doing something like just changing the font
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.800]   will make it feel very, very different,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.880]   which will keep it feeling nice and new.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.520]   I have mentioned--
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.200]   in the Apple Watch app, because I believe that uses San Francisco
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:38:59.720]   already.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.320]   There's all kinds of fonts in that app.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.720]   How are there?
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.800]   That's another thing we want to stamp out, right,
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.560]   is all of the--
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.680]   Well, like you said, we have consistency
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.840]   as a user-facing feature.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.240]   User-facing feature.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.040]   I have mentioned before, and I'll mention it again.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.760]   This is a book that came out in 2002.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.680]   If you're at all interested in typefaces,
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:25.400]   Eric Speicerman wrote a great book in 2002, which I've read.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.000]   And I actually keep around, stop stealing sheep
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.320]   and find out how type works.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.240]   And it really is a great book to read
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.280]   if you're at all interested in this subject.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.560]   Well, the Helvetica documentary is a great one.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.120]   That's a great one, too.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.240]   Isn't it Helvetica that Apple's abandoning?
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.160]   Or isn't it Helvetica news that they were using?
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.320]   It's time.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.560]   Helvetica is a great font, but you can--
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.920]   it's a little plain, a little vanilla.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.200]   Also, it's a little bit squat for the devices
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.040]   that are going to be using it.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   It's something that didn't occur to me
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.320]   until I was reading one of these articles
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.960]   about the New San Francisco font is that it echoes
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.400]   the shape of the Apple Watch in a very, very subtle way.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.680]   And so this is why--
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:13.720]   I mean, type design is a form of alchemy, because to you,
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.880]   again, it's either a clear font or it's not a clear font.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.280]   You either think it's pretty or you don't think
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.440]   it's particularly pretty.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.280]   But then you talk to the person who designed it,
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.120]   and you realize that they put as much thought
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.160]   into the development of this, as anybody did,
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.760]   into any large commercial work processor.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.680]   But here's my theory about design.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.680]   Here is the function that this letter form is designed to create.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.800]   Here are the influences from forms
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.920]   that go back 100 to 200 years.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.880]   And you're like, oh, my god, I had no eye.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   I was just typing.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.040]   I was just blown away that there's a curly thing on the T.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.760]   And here it is.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.480]   There's a whole long story about it.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.120]   It's kind of cool.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.480]   When you think about it, like a company like Apple,
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.920]   who cares so incredibly about design and sweats every detail,
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.880]   the fact that they don't control the typeface of their UI
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.360]   is kind of-- it seems kind of in hindsight now.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.920]   It seems to be crazy.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.320]   Like, you think that they would definitely
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.200]   have their own fonts and typefaces for their UI?
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:17.600]   I think I can understand why they wouldn't, only
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.040]   because it would be a project to Apple, particularly.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.680]   This would be a project on the same scale as we don't have
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.480]   a word processor.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.200]   Let's have a word processor.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.440]   And so if they can choose--
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.840]   if they have people there who can say, here are nine faces
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.960]   that we think highly of, anyone of which
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.440]   would be a really great selection.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.680]   All the while thinking, when can we actually
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.240]   get our hands on the idea of developing our own font?
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.720]   I think one of the things about Microsoft and Google
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.200]   is that it really does become part of the trade dress.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.000]   So when you have your own unique typeface,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.360]   that is not going to be available in any other form,
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.360]   it's a powerful way to link all of the devices and all
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.400]   the experiences that you're presenting to a consumer.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.720]   It seems like it's long overdue, but I would never
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.520]   myself think about--
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.240]   I can't imagine how long this has been in the works
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.400]   and how much money in time and actual money it
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.360]   costs to put this together.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.760]   First Swift in San Francisco.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.400]   It's a big banner a couple of years.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.000]   Yeah, really, really.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.720]   Maybe you'll be able to program Swift in San Francisco.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.520]   Yes, that's the next shoe drops.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.520]   Let's talk about speaking of next shoes,
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.040]   the next versions of both OS X and iOS.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.000]   I presume that we're going to find out more next months at WWDC
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.920]   about both.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:36.720]   But of course, Mark Gurman would never
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.920]   wait for an official announcement.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   He has an article at 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:48.720]   iOS 9 and OS 10.1.1, which is not a major point upgrade.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:53.120]   It's still Yosemite to bring quality focus, smaller apps,
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.360]   rootless security, legacy iPhone, iPad support.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.400]   What do you think?
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.040]   He is so good.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.160]   He called me and told me what my Christmas presents are going
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.720]   to be this year.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.080]   Well, that's them, isn't it?
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.720]   So let's start with iOS 9, code name Monarch.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.320]   I haven't heard all the stuff that he's heard,
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.360]   but I've heard the same thing about the focus
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.520]   on course stability and the focus on course security.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.160]   Those are two big emphasis that Apple has this year.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.800]   And they both make a lot of sense because security and privacy
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:25.200]   has been a Tim Cook level first slash feature on Apple.com
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.960]   and in all the pitches they've been making.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.520]   And they've got an incredibly good team working on security.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.000]   So making that front and center just makes a ton of sense,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.040]   especially when you consider things like jailbreak
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.440]   and things like locks, screen exploits
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.160]   and how they've made the system much stronger, especially
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.240]   in iOS 7 and iOS 8, we're both huge steps forward.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.080]   So carrying that forward makes a lot of sense.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.480]   And they got their big projects out of the way.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.280]   I know people are pained by what happened
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.040]   with Yosemite and iOS 8 and things like Discovery
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.400]   D and a lot of things.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.680]   But all of that had to come together and had to work
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.560]   because if you look at the Apple Watch,
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.520]   all those technologies will not develop for the Apple Watch
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.440]   where serendipitous for how it turned out
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.760]   to do everything from apps to extensions.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.680]   And it's a big painful transition.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.440]   But now that that's over, they have the time to go
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.360]   and sort of button everything down and polish it
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.800]   and make it rock solid for the next couple phases
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.240]   of those launches.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.200]   Have they fixed Discovery D?
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.040]   It is always being fixed.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.080]   So every version of Yosemite is had fixes for Discovery D.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.000]   I mean, they did a lot.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   They rewrote Discovery D.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.760]   They rewrote Launch D, which is another one of the major.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.560]   There was a, when you look at Yosemite,
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.960]   the design is what sticks out.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.120]   But the amount of actual important code
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.080]   that changed is pretty phenomenal.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.440]   Discovery D, we mentioned this I think a couple of weeks ago,
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.800]   Craig Hockenberry reported it at furbo.org
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.720]   in no uncertain terms a little bit explicitly,
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.880]   but I was with him.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.040]   And by the way, my Apple TVs are unconnected at home
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.920]   because I don't know if it's Discovery D,
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.320]   but I suddenly lost my network over the week.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.840]   Bracket 2, Bracket 3, Bracket 4, that's what this goes.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.320]   Rich Segal, I think I'd bracket 99 on his at one point.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.440]   So I unplugged the Apple TVs.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.160]   I unplugged all the routers
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.960]   'cause I have a three airport system for extenders.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.120]   And then I've left the Apple TVs off,
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.720]   rebooted the routers, the network rebuilt itself.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.560]   WDS worked and everything's fine.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.800]   But I'm very, there may be, it must be right
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.840]   because I have an older OS 10 version somewhere
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.880]   that it's re-infecting it.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.240]   I don't know, but I've left the Apple TVs unplugged.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.800]   - It's almost like a cash poisoning.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.640]   - Yeah.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.760]   - Yeah.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:33.440]   - I am hearing that, I agree with what Renee is saying.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.800]   I agree with the overall tone that stability
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.160]   is going to be a big goal.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.280]   One of the key mark features of OS 9,
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.720]   I have been hearing that although no company
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.720]   is ever unmoved by reports of how unstable
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.760]   a software releases or a bad time that users are having,
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:46:00.200]   Apple has particularly heard all of these complaints
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.600]   and it is a source of pain that they wish to,
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.120]   for themselves that they wish to solve.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.800]   So I do believe that if there's anything
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.720]   for the next release that is not off the table,
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.040]   it is in making sure that the people who review this
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.520]   are saying this is the most stable and secure
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:20.440]   and problem free version of iOS we've had in two years.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.720]   - And there was this create, we did a great episode
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:23.680]   of debug where we had Nitin Gannatra and Don Melton
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.560]   who were both directors at Apple on the software side
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.640]   talking about how you see bug fixes
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.120]   in their priority one P1 bugs and P2 bugs.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.520]   And a lot of time as a matter of pride,
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.720]   the engineers wanna fix those P2 bugs
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.920]   'cause their families use it, they use this stuff
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   and they simply don't have time.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.000]   - It's gotta be embarrassing.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.160]   - Well, it's embarrassing but it's also painful for them
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.400]   and they wanna spend their time on it
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.040]   but they've got a priority one bug
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.640]   that's crashing some important system
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.280]   and there's just, Nitin was talking about
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.360]   shuffling stuff into bags.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.040]   You can either get bigger bags
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.960]   which is more people or you can shovel less stuff into it
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.200]   which is less tasks.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.080]   And now it seems like, and the key is to get the people
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.800]   at the higher levels to understand this.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.240]   And I think the media attention helped everyone
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.360]   sort of realize that, and a lot of the engineers
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.640]   I think are super happy about this too,
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.720]   that it really is worthwhile.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.640]   Not only doing what was scheduled to be done
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.920]   but maybe doing a little bit more of that as well.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.760]   - Is Mark you--
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.600]   - Is Mark you--
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.440]   - Is it difficult to market this?
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.840]   It's like the key marquee feature though
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.640]   because one you've got to stand on a stage and say,
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.800]   yeah, okay, things kinda sucked.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.720]   And then if your big feature of iOS 9
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.800]   and the next version of iOS 10 is like stability.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.600]   Right, like it's not really very sexy.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.880]   - Should be the baseline effect.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.840]   - They did that with Snow Leopard.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.960]   Not necessarily saying we know that boy,
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.040]   did we crap all over the rug with the last one?
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.720]   Oh boy, like we got Febreze spraying
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.520]   in every single office and so--
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.360]   (laughing)
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.640]   There's a way for them to address it as saying
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.520]   that this is not going to be,
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.200]   we're putting as much features on.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.240]   I think the phrase that kept coming back to me
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.960]   during my briefings and stuff was that
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.800]   there are always things that are left in the drawer
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.440]   with every OS release.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.960]   And today with this release, we decided to simply try
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.880]   to empty out that drawer as much as possible.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.720]   - Yeah.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.720]   - Yeah, there was a great story about--
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.600]   - So that's easier with--
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.800]   Go on, Rene.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.000]   - No, no, please.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.840]   - That was a successful--
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.240]   - I think it's easier with OS 10 for that message though,
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.080]   I think.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:21.080]   I think iOS is a more widely consumer oriented thing.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.000]   It is something that people expect every year.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.840]   They look forward to the next OS release
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.160]   for the updates and for the new features.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.880]   And I think with OS 10,
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.440]   you can get away with it a little bit easier,
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.240]   but I think with iOS,
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.000]   if this is going to be the biggest feature of iOS,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.720]   whilst I would welcome it,
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.440]   I think it's gonna be interesting to see
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.360]   how it's reported widely.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.680]   - There was a great story about Snow Leopard
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.520]   because a lot of people say we need a Snow Leopard moment,
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.480]   but Snow Leopard was in a way a huge lie.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.560]   They had things they wanted to do like exchange
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.400]   and a Grand Central dispatch and OpenCL,
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.440]   which were major engineering undertakings.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.200]   And there was concern from Steve Jobs
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.520]   in the marketing department that you can't market this.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.800]   Like you guys wanna build it, but we can't sell this.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.160]   And then Phil Schiller and one of the guys in marketing
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.040]   said, "What a minute, what if we just say
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.640]   "no new user features?"
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.400]   Which wasn't true, there were a bunch of new user facing
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.560]   features, but it's hard to sell a few of them.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.720]   It's easy to make a story about no features,
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.920]   we're really digging deep.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.480]   And I think that's the kind of marketing acumen
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.320]   you bring to this.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.800]   You just, you make your line in the sand
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.120]   and you say, "And we've heard you
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.080]   "and we're really gonna focus on this."
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.640]   And I've heard they've actually moved,
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.480]   there's stuff that they haven't had a chance to do
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.040]   in iOS 7 that got pushed to 8
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.200]   and was supposed to be pushed to 9
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.600]   and maybe that'll now get pushed to 10
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.000]   to make more time to solidify things.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.240]   And I think that's the sort of message that you sell
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.160]   that yeah, there'll be a couple really cool things
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.040]   like bringing force touch to the new iPhone,
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.120]   major feature, some of the cool stuff they're gonna do
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.640]   is gonna be really customer facing.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.040]   But then underneath that, instead of 10, 10 pulls,
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.600]   you make one of those, increase stability
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.320]   and you have like a nice moment about that.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.800]   And I think that's how you sell it.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.120]   You make it as one of the four to eight icons
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.200]   that winds up lined up at the last card
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   when they give the presentation about what they've added
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.800]   to iOS 9, one of those icons is just simply
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.760]   the ongoing slow grinding of hard boards
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:11.320]   that is software development, particularly at this level.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.440]   Although Apple, just quickly, Apple is,
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.800]   it's interesting that the position
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.560]   that they're wearing particularly with the iPhone
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:22.760]   because Microsoft looks like they're starting
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.840]   to find the keys, they've lost the keys to the car
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.280]   for the past three or four or five years in terms of mobile.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.080]   But it looks like they've at least found the keys.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.160]   They're not in the car yet, but they found the keys.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.640]   Android is now at the level where you could really
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.600]   have a very, very serious discussion about
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.120]   which user interface is better designed.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.720]   And that's something you would never have considered
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.400]   talking about two years ago with Android.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.080]   And it's so much harder now to find areas
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.400]   of differentiation between an iPhone 6
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.200]   and not even something like the Galaxy,
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.760]   the Galaxy S6.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.720]   But even talking about here is a phone that costs $300
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.600]   and you own it, it's contract free.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:02.360]   And put them side by side and tell me what is in the iPhone,
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.720]   what the iPhone can do that this one cannot.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.880]   And it's not gonna be a relevant feature list
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:07.960]   for a lot of people.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.720]   And I think where Apple has the greatest opportunity
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:15.320]   because today is to put in features that software
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.520]   that actually makes it more compelling a buy to run the iOS
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.200]   rather than to have the actual iPhone itself.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.640]   So it's interesting, it'll be interesting to see
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.440]   during the keynote if Apple tries to really pump up
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.480]   here are ways in which we're making the iPhone
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.200]   materially better for users despite the fact
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.760]   that we can't really, we can't put three cameras in it now
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.480]   and we can't now make it like hexagonal screens.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.720]   We can't do things that make it really spectacularly different
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   but we can at least change the experience for people
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.720]   and what they would do to make the experience better.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.000]   - Well, it's like a magician.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.040]   So there is hand waving.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.720]   Look over here and the hand waving includes,
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:53.440]   according to a german, the new split screen iPad app views,
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.800]   they're finally gonna get a home kit app, right?
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.640]   - Yeah, it's like a good stuff.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.840]   - Mass transit direction.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.520]   There's plenty of, look over there, look over there.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.440]   Well, but these are really big deals.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.640]   I mean, it's the-- - Well, I'm not,
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.600]   I'm not, I'm not, I'm sorry.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.320]   I didn't mean you were dismissing it,
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.320]   but it's, I think that the most interesting,
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.800]   obviously we're all talking about the Apple Watch
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.200]   because it's cool, it's so different
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.600]   and now we actually have them.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.360]   But I think the most interesting conversation
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.240]   for the next year is going to be whatever
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.280]   is Apple going to do with the iPad?
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.080]   Because are they clearly are not,
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.720]   the sales figures are saying that people are responding
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.400]   to larger screen phones more strongly than they're even
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.560]   responding to larger, excuse me, smaller sized tablets.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.520]   But does that mean that Apple puts iPad on, let's say,
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.520]   an iPod track where they will continue to have it
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.360]   in the product line but will definitely be
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.560]   a second tier product or do they find a way to reinvent it
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.640]   and represent it, not as a,
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.520]   not as the device has been for the past five years,
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:54.040]   which is you tell us what it does.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.960]   We'll agree with you because it does everything
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.600]   and it does all those things very well.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.640]   And then they, and if they can start to present it as,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.120]   here is a 12 inch version of it that runs multiple apps.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.640]   Why would you even consider buying a five or $600
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.400]   Windows Notebook if you're a Windows user
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.200]   when you can have something that is much more mobile
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.600]   than this, it works much, it's much more stable
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.040]   than a $600 Windows Notebook.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.880]   And it's a lot more delightful to use.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.480]   It's gonna be interesting to see how they solve
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.180]   that problem of declining iPad sales.
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:25.040]   - I for one am very much looking forward
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:30.040]   to an iPad Pro 12.9 inch with pressure sensitivity.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:35.080]   (laughing)
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.080]   - I'll buy that.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.800]   - I've actually been thinking about that a lot.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:43.080]   I mean, I did buy an iPad Mini because my personal iPad
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.360]   was a third generation, like the first Retina one,
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.000]   which was not a great iPad and was really starting
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.760]   to feel along with the tooth.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.480]   And one of the reasons why I decided to replace it
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.960]   with an iPad Mini instead of an Air 2 was in anticipation
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.160]   of there being a Pro later this year or next year
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.280]   that I would be more interested in having as, again,
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.160]   as a workhorse taken with you when you travel computer.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.800]   But now I've been, it's interesting to see what these,
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.680]   what Intel's new processors are doing
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.720]   on both sides of the fence.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.520]   That now for, if Apple asserts,
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.080]   how much are they gonna charge for an iPad Pro?
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.880]   Would they replace the iPad Air with it or say that
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.880]   the minimum buy-in is going to be around MacBook territory?
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.280]   It's gonna be about minimum buy-in,
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.680]   it's gonna be $850, $900 for this.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.160]   And then when you, I can't, every time I approach this,
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.640]   whether as a reviewer or as a consumer, I think, okay,
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:35.520]   I've got $900 in my hands to solve the problem of,
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.400]   I need a powerful computer that's ultra, ultra, ultra,
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.680]   ultra portable.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.480]   What can I spend this on that might not necessarily
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.680]   be an iPad Pro?
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:48.040]   And then you look at some tablets from Dell and Lenovo
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:50.840]   that can do a lot of what it doesn't,
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.280]   of course doesn't run iOS, so it doesn't run tablet mode
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.800]   as well as iOS well.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:58.000]   But here is an ultra, ultra, ultra portable machine
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.960]   that's much more portable than my 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.600]   But it weighs about only a little bit more than,
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.720]   and I maybe an iPad Pro, it costs a little bit less.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.640]   And I will not have any problems running desktop apps
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.960]   with it and I get a free keyboard with it.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.040]   And a touchscreen and all this sort of cool stuff.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.920]   It's gonna be interesting to see how everybody
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   navigates that question.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.560]   - Is the MacBook in that equation at all, the new MacBook?
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.400]   - No, because it's a, now you're talking about
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.800]   $1,300 computer.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.640]   - Yeah, price.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.160]   - I don't, I think, I think it's a,
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.240]   I actually think it's a very good machine.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.840]   I know I promised last week that my review would be
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.720]   on the SunTimes, it's actually just been filed.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.040]   So it won't be up for another day or two yet.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:39.240]   But for $1,300 it becomes, it's at that interesting balance
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.000]   point between, it is not, it's a machine that's optimized
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.760]   to be the Mac that you use when you travel,
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.400]   but it's priced as the one that you have to do
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.200]   all your work on because not a whole lot of people
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.320]   have $1,300 to spend on a second.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.480]   - Yeah, it's a name.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.080]   - So that's why, that's why it's gotten me thinking about,
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.480]   again, these six, seven, eight, $900 Lenovo Transporters,
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.000]   Transformers that you, I mean, the Lenovo has a model
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.760]   that is a little bit lighter, even a little bit thinner
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:11.760]   than the 12 inch MacBook, but it has a better keyboard,
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.440]   it has more ports to it.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.800]   It's easier to travel with the battery life kind of stinks
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.320]   compared to the new MacBook, but that's not something
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.240]   that a lot of people, that some people are gonna like
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.080]   to have as an option.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.640]   - What model is that?
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:27.240]   - You know, I don't have it in front of me.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.080]   - I can find it.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.800]   - I know people, when the MacBook came out, people said,
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.640]   well, you know, Lenovo already did this.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.160]   - I think it's got the Lenovo V, I'm thinking V.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.800]   I have to look and see if it could be wrong.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.400]   It's a V something.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.000]   - The problem is you have to use Windows.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.280]   I've got review hardware coming, but--
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.720]   - Who wants to use Windows?
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.080]   - I'm boycotting Lenovo still.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.880]   They have like a super classy box.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.640]   - Well, everybody, you're in the penalty box for me.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.960]   - And is it okay if I suck my thumb and fondle the box?
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.320]   - It's your security box, though.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.080]   (laughing)
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.400]   Hey Renee, let me see your black watch.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.720]   - Oh yeah, I love this, Leo.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.840]   - It's based black, so it's diamond like coated.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.760]   And I can't describe it other than it,
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.080]   'cause it's metal, but it doesn't--
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:08.920]   - I want it.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:12.280]   - It feels like some Kryptonian or Batmobile like substance.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.600]   It's just, and it's so--
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.680]   - Is that stainless?
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.240]   - Yeah.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.040]   - That does look really good.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.680]   - And the bracelet is so, I mean, it pops right open,
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.960]   take it right off.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.520]   It's, and the way that you pull the watch,
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:28.840]   the way you pull the little bands apart is pretty awesome,
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.080]   'cause you really do just push the thing in and pull it.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.160]   And it-- - Lord.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.680]   - Don't break it on the air, Renee.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.040]   - No, it comes right open,
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.440]   and then you can take out the--
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.440]   - So much prettier. - So much prettier.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.280]   - On each side.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.080]   - Can you have more than one Apple watch,
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   or is that considered--
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.640]   - You can, but you have, it's not set up for that,
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.440]   so you actually have to unpair and repair it,
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.160]   because the backup is on your phone, though.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.120]   It's much easier to have two Apple watches
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.840]   than to have an Apple watch with two iPhones.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.280]   - They should, they really have to understand
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.520]   that watch people never have just one watch.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.840]   I mean, if you're into watches, you always have,
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.400]   I mean, I saw Ray Donovan, he pulled out a drawer,
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.960]   there's all these watches, right?
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.520]   - It's a constraint, it's just they couldn't,
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.600]   I don't know if they, there was not a lot of time
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.240]   to get all of the stuff done, but well,
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.920]   it's a one-to-one relationship,
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.840]   because there's a lot of things that have to,
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.520]   we've all talked about our dissatisfaction with messages,
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.440]   for example, when you have multiple things,
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.200]   and the ability to make sure that one iPhone
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.160]   and one Apple watch worked really well together,
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.600]   it wasn't the priority.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.440]   - That looks so pretty.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.000]   - They anticipated that with the bands, right?
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.720]   That was to, maybe they--
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.560]   - Right, change the band.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.880]   - People will buy one body, but a ton of bands,
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.120]   but I guess, yeah, when you look at--
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:27.960]   - So spoilers for me.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.360]   - From some days I like sport,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.400]   but some days I wanna wear space black, steel, you know.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.920]   - One month in my--
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:34.760]   - Expensive.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:36.920]   - My million A's is already looking ratty.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.200]   - It's squirrely for my--
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   - No, look at what they--
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.040]   - This is all--
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.320]   - They don't think--
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:44.880]   - They get inside your head, they sell you the expensive thing,
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.600]   and then they make you feel bad for not having
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.760]   the more expensive thing.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.760]   - See the wear on that?
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.680]   - That's stainless steel, the way I have other stainless steel
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.120]   look, real stainless steel watches,
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   and you can go to a jeweler and have that buffed out,
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.560]   or you can get some product when you're on.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:01.560]   - Or I could buy a space black watch with the black bands.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.160]   - I like where this is going.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.160]   - I really like that.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.760]   - So DLC is really hard to scratch,
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.640]   but once it scratches, you're basically,
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.800]   you got a sharpie, and that's your only--
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.560]   - Oh, so yours is not scratchable.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.080]   Mine scratches but buffs.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:15.920]   - I have, and I also have a--
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.760]   - Oh, stop it.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:18.680]   - I'll talk about later in the picks of the week.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.560]   - Oh, stop it, man.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.840]   - See, man has a problem.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.640]   - Yes, I'm trusting that--
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.240]   - I'm trusting that mobile nations is paying for this, right?
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.080]   - No, that's fine.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.640]   - When he includes paying his rent this month.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   (laughing)
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.960]   - Renee, I think you have a problem.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:35.800]   For those listening, he just held up four other bands.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.320]   - I don't have any other expenses, Leo.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.640]   I mean, I've paid off everything else,
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.560]   so now just all my money goes to buying a technology.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.640]   - So Apple, as it should--
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.480]   - Yeah.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.320]   - I shouldn't complain.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:44.400]   - And Ancillary Companies.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.240]   - I shouldn't say anything,
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.880]   'cause I played with Lisa, she got the gold MacBook,
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.680]   and I played with it, and I said, "I have to have this."
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.840]   So I'm just as bad as you.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.280]   - Apple's so good at getting us.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.840]   - They make lustworthy items.
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.760]   - Lust, techno lust.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.440]   Wasn't that the hashtag, Phil Schiller actually
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.040]   showed on stage? - Hashtag, mac lust, yeah.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.000]   - Yikes.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.520]   (laughing)
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.120]   - $1,099.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:11.960]   - For the black?
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.600]   - For the black 40 stainless steel case
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.880]   with space black stainless steel link bracelets.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.760]   - You say that like it's a bad thing, Andy.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.120]   - That's a horrifying thing, Renee.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:20.960]   (laughing)
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.320]   - No, don't give him a hard time.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.880]   - It's cheap compared to an edition.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.040]   - Holy crap.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.200]   - I actually like it more than the edition.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.040]   Don't tell anyone.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.400]   - I'm sorry, I've shown it again,
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.000]   'cause it does really look nice.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.920]   - Yeah, so.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.160]   - And that band is like an expando band, right?
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.560]   - Yeah, this has four of the,
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.840]   the way I just took it open before,
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.600]   you can open it up and just pull the links off.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.640]   - Yeah, but once you've set your size,
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.000]   it kind of hugs your wrist with a gentle kind of loving embrace.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.160]   - Yeah, it's like an armored bracer.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.000]   - I want it.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.400]   (laughing)
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.640]   - But I'm super happy with it.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.000]   - I should wait until you scratch it,
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.040]   and then maybe I won't lie.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.080]   - Who got his the same day?
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.600]   I think we got his day before mine,
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.920]   and we both spend a few minutes just being incredibly
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.200]   kiddish about how great they were.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.000]   - I apologize, I should not.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.160]   - No, we need that more.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.480]   - No, no, we.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.920]   - I was trying to, I had one of those moments
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.400]   where I remembered it being as more than $1,000,
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.800]   and no, it can't possibly be more than $1,000.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.080]   Yeah, it is $1,000.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.840]   - And I should make sure Mike understands,
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.400]   we have a pact amongst hosts,
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.800]   not to give each other a hard time
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.520]   about what we spend on technology.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.880]   - Right, or beard maintenance.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.080]   - Or beard maintenance.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.560]   Okay, I'm sorry about the beard maintenance thing.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.800]   I violated that, I think early on.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.880]   (laughing)
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.520]   - I support your decisions, Ranae.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520]   I want you to know that.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.360]   - That's right.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.200]   - I support you.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.040]   - That's right, Mike.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.800]   That's the way to do it.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.920]   - Mike and I are companions in iPhone 6+
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.880]   acknowledgement as well.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.880]   We have a lot of things in common.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.400]   - No, see, I'm still with the 6.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.280]   I feel like the plus doesn't do anything.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.360]   Has that changed by the way?
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.280]   'Cause when it first came out,
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.520]   it didn't do anything but make everything bigger.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.880]   - The battery, but-- - The slowly--
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.880]   - Battery, but-- - Battery,
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.240]   but I have battery problems with this.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.880]   - I'm telling you, I've been an exclusive
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.520]   iOS user for a full week now.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.840]   - You have to be friends.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.160]   - My Android phone is not even charged,
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.400]   I'm not even carrying it.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.640]   I'm exclusively iOS for the first time in two years.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.360]   And the one thing that is like,
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.760]   the most delightful thing ever is,
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.920]   I've got the iPhone 6+ and I didn't have
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.320]   the right power adapter for my car.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.960]   And so for two days, I was driving for three hours,
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.440]   GPS active, streaming audio,
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.480]   and coming back after three hours of driving,
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.040]   all on battery, still got 86% battery left.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.760]   And I would not have made that, oh God,
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.440]   then the Android battery life stinks.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.240]   The hype, Evan, the most humiliating thing ever.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.080]   - I know.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.600]   - If Apple, I've spent 50 minutes talking
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.160]   about the battery life of everything they do,
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.880]   game over, game over.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.880]   - I don't know if you guys have found this,
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.960]   but I'm using the Apple Watch.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.480]   And the Apple Watch, I routinely have 40 to 50% left
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.280]   at night now, but I also have way more battery
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.240]   life on my iPhone because all of the little tasks
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.960]   that would otherwise light up the screen.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.240]   And an iPhone is an LCD screen.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.080]   It's either on or off.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.440]   There's no battery savings to lighting up a few pixels.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.480]   The minute that lock screen goes lit,
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.800]   there's power being consumed.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.800]   And because I use it less,
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.080]   I now have so much battery life left on my iPhone.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.840]   I don't often charge it overnight anymore.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.000]   - Yeah.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.360]   - It's a winning combination.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.160]   - It's true, Andy, I had the exact same,
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.920]   but even with the 6, I have yet to use it up
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.120]   before the day is done.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.280]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.080]   It's not just about the size of the battery.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.600]   It's like remembering exactly how good
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.560]   and how holistic Apple's approach towards power management
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.400]   is.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.800]   It's not that, hey, well, we want more battery life.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.840]   We'll put in a bigger battery.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.120]   And it's not even, we'll slap down certain apps.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.880]   It's that they designed this thing from the first time
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.720]   they connect one copper molecule to another copper molecule
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.640]   in the design of this.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.200]   They're thinking about power management
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.040]   between those two copper atoms.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.320]   - It's millimeters and milliamps.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.320]   And that just in time, multitasking,
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.200]   I think is gonna be the future because they've done
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.720]   all this coalescing and update stuff.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.400]   So it knows you're usually check Twitter at six o'clock.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.160]   So it doesn't need to check Twitter at any time
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.200]   before you wake up.
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.000]   It'll just wait and do it a few minutes beforehand.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.920]   And I think as technology gets smarter,
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.600]   more and more things will just act that way.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.240]   It'll be the way things are done.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.640]   - Renee, even 22,000 words more about Apple Watch
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.680]   than I have at this point,
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.240]   does the, is the watch supposed to do similar things like that?
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.840]   'Cause one of the things that still frustrates me is that
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:09.960]   I'll think, okay, you know what?
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.560]   I think I'll see if there any,
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.960]   I'll find out what the score of the Red Sox game is.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.120]   I'll use a glimpse at MLB at bat.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.560]   And then I'll flick up to get to the MLB at bat
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.400]   and then updating, updating, updating, updating.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.480]   And in the time that I'm updating,
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.240]   it's like, or I could take the phone out of my pocket
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.840]   and unlock it and launch,
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.680]   oh yes, you know what?
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.680]   I got it on the phone faster than I got it on the watch.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.800]   Does the watch learn what apps you tend to use
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.000]   and try to preload information?
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.200]   Or is it all, when you ask for the information,
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.040]   that's when you get to your--
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.360]   - It's just magic.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.960]   - Yeah, I don't believe it's as sophisticated as that yet.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.720]   What it does do is if you use something frequently,
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.960]   it keeps it alive and cache and updates it more frequently.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.000]   And if you don't, it winds that app down
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.960]   and then it has to go through that cycle again.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.000]   I think that with the Apple watch this generation,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.480]   and I think actually Apple went overboard
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.080]   given how much battery life I'm getting,
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.000]   everything is a slave to battery and everything powers down.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.120]   That's why you have to reboot when there's power reserve
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.360]   because it literally shuts off demons
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.240]   and those things have to be restarted.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.680]   So it is a complete slave to battery life
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.600]   and every little inconvenience that comes.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.440]   So we've talked about this before,
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.920]   the currency of mobile is battery life.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.200]   Every feature you pay for with battery life
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.000]   and they've been incredibly conservative.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.840]   And again, I think maybe a little too much
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:17.840]   given how well it's working.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:21.480]   - Well, I have to give them credit because I'm with you, Andy.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.800]   That's the first thing I noticed when I--
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.520]   And like you, I have to use an iPhone
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.680]   if I'm gonna use the Apple watch.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.240]   And boy, you sure do notice that.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.720]   On the other hand, I struggle a little bit
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.600]   with the iPhone UI and stuff, but you know what?
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.280]   Maybe that's worth it to have good battery life
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.360]   and a wide piece.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360]   - And that was part of the discussion.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.240]   - The reason is good looking is Renee's is--
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.640]   - Well, that was part of the discussion we had earlier
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.760]   when we talked about, you know,
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.760]   people were worried about the iPhone battery life
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.840]   and there were reports that it was good,
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.080]   reports that there was no good,
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.120]   but that's just concerned and stressed
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.280]   until it actually ships and you can see what it is.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.560]   And if you're interested in that kind of thing,
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.840]   maybe you wanna watch that drama,
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.800]   but if you're a normal customer,
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.440]   not worrying about that stuff
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.040]   and just waiting to see how it works for you,
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.920]   I think is way more valuable.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.560]   - Just for, let me plug in my laptop here.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.880]   - Informational purposes alone, Renee.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.320]   Not that I would ever consider buying one,
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.280]   but which exactly on here,
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.680]   is this 42 millimeters space black stainless steel case
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:17.840]   with it's that one.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.200]   - Yes, and I got the 42 millimeter.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:23.280]   - Not that I would ever consider adding that to my card
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.440]   or anything.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.600]   - That and the pink bracelet,
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.920]   where it took a long time to ship,
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.360]   I guess I'm guessing deals.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.880]   - You bought that band.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.200]   My mom got the pink sport one and hers originally said June
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.640]   and then it arrived the same time as me
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.080]   and it looks like these were amongst,
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.120]   except for the additions, the additions shipped afterwards,
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.360]   but these were the two longest shipping.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.240]   - You guys get in Apple care, I've been getting it.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.560]   I don't normally do the extended warranty thing,
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.400]   but I have the-- - I do,
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.400]   'cause I drop stuff Leo and I've gotten
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.160]   almost every iPhone replaced at least once.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.400]   - So really Andy, you shouldn't think 1099,
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.080]   more like $1,168.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.520]   - And for me, the Canadian exchange.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.400]   - In America, yeah.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.720]   - I will say that it's,
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.640]   I'm starting to sketch out like,
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.360]   well, I'll be writing about this in a couple of weeks.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.760]   - I did not click ads a card, that was a mistake.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:09.360]   - Will you believe I'm trying to get the button
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.600]   to start the click, holy, don't click.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.000]   Who's doing that?
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.760]   I guess the simplest thing to do is just wait
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.080]   for the order to ship and then return it.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.400]   Damn it.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.160]   That's what I'm telling you about,
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.600]   about user interface design.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.080]   They gotta catch these bugs on the web end.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.320]   - I cannot click check out, just by itself.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.000]   - What am I gonna do with this gorgeous watch
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.800]   that will make me look like some sort of international playboy?
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.360]   - Hey, and let's not forget.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.200]   - I'm gonna get some photos.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.400]   - You get two boxes now.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.240]   - Yes.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.080]   - I can replace the boxes,
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.320]   I inadvertently recycled this morning.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.160]   I'm sorry, Renee, you said there's more pictures.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.880]   - I put some photos in the Google Doc for you.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.440]   - Ugh.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.360]   - You could play Apple Watch Jenga,
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.920]   only $1,000 per prick.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.640]   It's terrible.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.480]   - I think John Sir accusedo was talking about
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.480]   the hotel prices for WWDC,
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.480]   and he was saying every night was an Apple Watch.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.400]   - Yikes.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   All right, let's take a break,
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.920]   'cause I gotta pay for this watch.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.360]   (laughing)
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.360]   But, we will continue.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.560]   I wanna talk more about new OS 10,
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.680]   you know, 10.10, 10, 11.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.520]   (laughing)
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.840]   It's getting hard now.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:19.680]   - Gala.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.200]   - Yosemite 10, 11, how about that?
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.120]   - It's called Gala Leo.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.480]   - Gala, is that the key?
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.400]   - Yeah, GALA.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.880]   - That's an Apple, Gala, Apple.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.000]   - Yeah.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.920]   - They're gonna run out of those two.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.800]   Actually, no, 'cause you know what?
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.720]   The Apple industry continues to bat
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.000]   and new Apple breeds every day, practically.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.240]   - OS 10, Granny Smith.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.880]   (laughing)
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.280]   - Is there a Granny Smith?
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.120]   - Yes.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.440]   (laughing)
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.800]   - I'm just, I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.760]   because somehow this machine seems to have entered
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.520]   my password onto the Apple site and I checked out.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.160]   I don't, you've been hacked Leo.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.480]   (laughing)
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.440]   You should let the transaction complete
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.720]   so the FBI will have more information on port
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.320]   based on which to track and prosecute.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.840]   How could that happen?
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.300]   That seems impossible.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.360]   Our show today brought to you by
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.200]   legalzoom.com.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.720]   Not a law firm, I wanna be clear about this,
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.560]   but they're great because they get you,
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.920]   they give you the ability to do a lot of the legal work
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.120]   you need to do for your family, for your business
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.720]   and a much lower price, although they can't connect you
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.800]   with an independent attorney.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.800]   Should you need one, I'll explain how that works.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.160]   Look, this is a magic time for people starting
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.000]   their own businesses.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.080]   There has never been a better time
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.400]   in the history of the world.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.960]   If you're doing it, if you're an innovator,
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.680]   you wanna launch your dream,
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.520]   you gotta remember legalzoom.com.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.280]   That was the advice Kevin Rosk gave me.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.440]   Did you see him on Silicon Valley, by the way?
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.160]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.680]   Man, he said you should form an LLC
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.640]   when you start to it, this was 10 years ago.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:58.000]   I did, legalzoom.com helped for a really reasonable price.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.800]   Register your trademark, did that too
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.640]   to protect your products and services.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.480]   I don't have any patents,
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.040]   but maybe you have something that you've invented,
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.000]   patented it too.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.880]   Legalzoom has helped over the last 10 years,
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.840]   more than a million people, just like you, just like me.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.280]   Turn their ideas into reality.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.160]   For a limited time, special savings this month
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.080]   on any trademark copywriter,
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.480]   provisional patent application, wow,
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.240]   there's just a week left on that.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.080]   Go to legalzoom.com today to get started.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.560]   They can help even if you have a great idea,
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.400]   but you're not sure to where to begin.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.720]   But they're not a law firm, so let me explain
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.800]   what they've done is they've created
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.680]   this Legalzoom Legal Plan.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.800]   They've lined up a network of independent attorneys
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.480]   in almost every state.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.200]   They've pre-negotiated flat rate pricing.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.680]   You can read the reviews of the attorneys,
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.800]   unedited reviews from Legalzoom users.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.440]   Their profile, pick the one that's right for you.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.560]   You know exactly ahead of time how much it's gonna cost
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.480]   and it's not much, and get the advice you need.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.840]   I just think this is so great.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.240]   This is Legalzoom is really empowering people
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.660]   to live out their dream.
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.280]   Legalzoom.com.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.400]   Now all I ask is when you check out,
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.600]   you use the offer code MBW,
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.240]   and that'll get you your special discount too.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.440]   So there's a little reward for you too.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.920]   That way they know where you heard it.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:14.920]   Legalzoom.com and don't forget the promo code is MBW.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:23.360]   I fortunately can't remember my Apple password, so...
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.920]   - I bet Lisa changed it.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.000]   (laughing)
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.880]   You know, I thought I wasn't hearing it correctly.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.640]   I may have dodged a bullet there.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:38.040]   Okay, so we got Yosemite 10/11.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.320]   This I presume again is gonna be all stuff they'll talk about
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.960]   in a couple of weeks at the WWDC, right?
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.040]   - Yep.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.080]   - Tell us what we know about that
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.920]   or what you know about that, or what Mark Herman knows about.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.120]   - I've heard very little about it,
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.200]   and Mark has posted some stuff about it,
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.920]   but I think it's still far less than iOS and iOS,
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.560]   so either there's less to talk about,
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.800]   or there's more in terms of the structural stuff
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.640]   than we would have anticipated.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.880]   I'm sure a lot of the stuff will be the same
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   because they're doing a lot of things
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:10.040]   that are both on both sides of the OS's now.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.320]   - Yeah, my iMessage stuff and map stuff,
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.720]   that kind of stuff that you can just goes across both.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.600]   - Yeah, Mark mentioned that.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.120]   I think he, I forgot to call it rootless,
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.160]   where it's gonna be a new system,
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.680]   and I don't know if that's iOS only,
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.800]   but where even if you're an administrator,
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.200]   you don't have root access,
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.160]   which would protect you against another slew
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.880]   of security threats.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:29.960]   - That's interesting.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.560]   Is there any way to get root?
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.640]   - I'm sure there's a way you can escalate
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.120]   to probably in the terminal or for apps
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.880]   that really need it, especially non-app store apps,
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.320]   but I think in general, it's meant,
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.320]   I think a lot of stuff is meant to protect
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.960]   most of the people most of the time,
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.240]   and advanced users will still,
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.080]   especially on the Mac,
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.320]   they'll have a lot of things that they can do
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.840]   outside of that protection.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.440]   But for people who don't need it,
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.560]   or never think about it,
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.520]   just not running in root,
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.320]   or not running with full administrator privileges,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.040]   is a huge win.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.120]   - We got a guy who just happens,
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:57.960]   I won't name your name,
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.240]   and I won't show a picture of you,
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.920]   who works in iOS forensics.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.640]   What do you think,
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.960]   I guess this is only desktop,
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.120]   but rootless seems to me to be,
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.720]   I don't see how you could do that.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.160]   Ultimately, something has to have
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.160]   super user permissions on an operating system.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.560]   So Jay's not harder to escalate.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.520]   - They've got some super smart,
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.160]   like the people who created sandboxing,
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.760]   the people who are doing core security now at Apple
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.480]   are super, super smart.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.560]   And I'm guessing that they,
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.320]   I don't know anything about the engineering,
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.600]   but I'm guessing there's a way
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.560]   to give you a certain select amount of privileges,
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.160]   without giving you full access,
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.680]   whether that's a virtualized environment,
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.440]   or whether it's a pseudo environment or something.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.520]   - Hmm.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.600]   - Who knows if it'll be ready,
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.160]   'cause all this stuff is just,
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.560]   always work in progress until it ships.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.800]   But the idea, I think, is super interesting.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.120]   - Got a tweet from Scott Gilliland,
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.920]   flyer Scott on Twitter, he says,
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.240]   Leo Laport, Renee Richie, Annie and Aco, Mike,
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.680]   we all support you and your purchase
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.240]   at the Space Black statements, still watch.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.240]   - That's for your, that's just--
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.320]   - Tag not a problem.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.600]   Thank you for your support.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.400]   (laughing)
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.240]   - I think that's the wrong question.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.080]   - I'm glad she could be with us.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.600]   - You're all enablers.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.960]   (laughing)
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.840]   - You just want to see the drunk guy drink some more,
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:11.920]   and then act crazy.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.760]   - That's exactly it.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.600]   - That's exactly it.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.040]   - The money doesn't go to Apple, go to Lenovo,
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.880]   we're just trying to direct him at this point, Annie.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.640]   (laughing)
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.360]   - It's true, little, the Lenovo, you know.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.200]   - Oh, fiche.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.040]   - I think that's not a city.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:23.880]   - You're on a one year time now.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.880]   - I think that's necessarily Lenovo.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.280]   I was chatting a couple of days ago,
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.840]   and I've said about the, of course,
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.800]   conversation has to be about the Apple Watch,
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.760]   and I'm saying, or I could have,
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.680]   I could have like the sport edition with a black band,
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.240]   and like take someone out,
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.920]   concluding airfare to the highest rated restaurant
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:46.480]   in Los Angeles for an 18 course chef's tasting menu,
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.600]   and still have the watch.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.760]   It's like, okay.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.320]   - I don't know.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.160]   - A real time follow up,
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.840]   and I had to find Mac just post an article
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.760]   about some people who are flipping their boxes
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.320]   for more money than Android Wear watches.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.560]   (laughing)
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.200]   (laughing)
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.520]   - Now you see, this costs more than an Android Wear watches.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.600]   - This is about a journalistic point of view.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.680]   It's right.
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.480]   Rather, on other sites would be, isn't it great
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.360]   that for the amount of crazy money
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.600]   that people want to spend on a box,
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.520]   you can actually have a fully functioning
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.760]   working Android Wear watch.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.680]   - This seller that they mention is asking $59.99
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.920]   for their plastic and fabric of a watch box.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.040]   Holy cow.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:30.360]   - 'Cause the headline just makes this work.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.040]   - I just, the thing that's depressing to me
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.920]   is I literally recycled those boxes.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.360]   I kept them for a month,
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.760]   but here we are, you know,
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.120]   it's exactly one month since I got my Apple watch,
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.800]   and I thought it's time.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.600]   - Your black stainless steel will come with a whole new box.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.440]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.280]   There you go.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.280]   Let me press buy now.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.200]   (laughing)
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.280]   - You're practically getting the watch for free.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.120]   (laughing)
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.120]   Just make sure you rehearse that in a mirror
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.560]   two or three times before you talk.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.840]   You say that to the accountant.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:57.680]   - Yeah.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.200]   The twitch might give me away.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.560]   - I was speaking about boxes.
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.400]   I got a box of premium,
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   like these Thailand that you have these pineapple cookies
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.200]   or whatever.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.000]   And so the box that they came in was also
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.640]   maybe even better than the Apple watch,
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.720]   because look, it's how hard it is to get that one.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.240]   - Ooh, that is better.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.480]   - So there is packaging.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.800]   If you want to sell a box of cookies
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.480]   for more than $2.99,
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.160]   you do have to upgrade the boxing, I suppose.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.280]   - Andy just sent us a link.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.400]   Fire breaks out at Apple Facility in Arizona.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.480]   It is out now.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.800]   It was the confined to the solar panels on the roof.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.840]   Is this the sapphire plant?
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.640]   - Yeah, that's the former sapphire plant.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.920]   Rumored to be converted into a data center.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.760]   It went to alarm.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.520]   - They must have built it on an Indian burial ground
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.360]   or something.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.640]   I mean, they really, this thing is snake.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.640]   - Sometimes dead is better.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.480]   - I don't know.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.520]   - Well, or maybe it's just like people on break
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.840]   realizing that it's about lunchtime over there right now.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.800]   So it's got to be a super hot surface.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:01.640]   - Maybe that's it.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.480]   - The moral day weekend,
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.920]   you probably got some hamburger patties left over.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:04.840]   - A little grilling.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.520]   - It just got away from them a little bit.
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:10.080]   - To alarm fire, the new Apple plant.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.280]   It Elliot and Signal Butte.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.600]   Solar panels on fire, the fire is now reported out.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.800]   (laughs)
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.320]   But there you go.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.320]   - Or maybe that's part of like when Tim Cook was talked about,
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.840]   well, we do have plans for the facility
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:25.960]   that we can put in burning it down,
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.120]   burning it to the money.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.200]   - Burning it to the ground.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.040]   - Oh Lord.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:34.120]   - Tim Cook, who was, who would Apple spokesperson says
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.440]   was hundreds of miles away from the incident?
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:37.640]   - I've been in the fire program.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.160]   (laughs)
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.680]   - Apple will put in subway train and bus guides
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.920]   for iOS 9 maps.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.560]   Something Google Maps has had for awhile,
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.240]   but something you could use.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:51.600]   And is now using robots for indoor mapping.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.600]   Again, this is catch up for Apple,
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.480]   but it's interesting,
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.880]   Apple is not seeding in any way the map markets to Google.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.040]   They're gonna-- - But they're dressed
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.400]   and-- - They're important it is.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.280]   - Yeah.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.520]   - They've been trying to do transit for awhile.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.640]   The problem with transit and Google did a really good job
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.360]   of overcoming this is that it's owned by all these little
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.200]   fifdoms and different municipalities,
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.600]   keep the rights to their transit information
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.160]   and you have to go and literally municipality
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.640]   by municipality town by town and get that information
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:17.800]   and then aggregate it.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.080]   And they don't want the same thing to happen
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.080]   that happened with maps,
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.000]   which was largely bad data aggregation and cleansing
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.240]   and sanitization.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.880]   So they wanna do a really nice job with this.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.040]   And they bought a couple, I think three, two or three,
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:31.000]   at least transit companies to sort of speed that process up.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.800]   But it takes awhile.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.680]   Google spent a long time doing it.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.800]   - It's very, very telling that Nokia has their own here.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.360]   There are Nokia here maps trucks that do their own mapping.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:44.440]   There's Bing that has their own mapping trucks.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.040]   When the greatest, it was working out to be one
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.160]   of the greatest acquisitions that Google could possibly
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.760]   made was to buy ways because they have 50 million people
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.360]   across the world that are essentially deputized
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.640]   into the remapping system and they get it.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.520]   And also about six or 7,000 people that just for fun
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.480]   like to update their own local maps
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.560]   to make them more accurate for construction things.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.920]   This is such valuable information that this is well
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.080]   under the category of something that Apple wants to own
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.560]   for themselves as opposed to being beholden
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.400]   to another company to provide this data
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.320]   'cause it's non-negotiable.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:23.320]   It's almost like buying your buttons for the phone
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.120]   on-screen buttons for an outside source.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.000]   It's such an intrinsic part of the mobile experience
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.440]   that why would you not own the data
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:31.920]   that you're using for this?
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.200]   - We've heard over and over that Nokia wants to sell
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.560]   it's here map division.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.480]   Microsoft licenses those maps for Bing maps.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.800]   But does not own them.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.480]   - The bundle with Blackberry have a fire sale.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.920]   (laughs)
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.720]   - I'm wondering why Apple, I mean,
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.160]   Apple's got more money than they know what to do with.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.040]   This seems like such a natural,
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.480]   it's overseas money, right?
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:53.520]   It would go to Finland.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.800]   I don't understand why it's just not a done deal.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.760]   - They have a license agreement.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.600]   There used to be two companies, Teleav,
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.960]   and I figured what the other one was called.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.320]   - They bought two. - Teleav, yeah,
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.360]   Teleav, and one of them was bought by Tom Tom
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.480]   and one was bought by Nozier.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.800]   Apple licenses the Tom Tom maps.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.640]   But to Andy's point,
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.600]   that might not be where they need to spend their money.
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.120]   Maybe they need to spend their money
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.240]   on a company that does what they're already doing,
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.480]   which is massive aggregation of user base, traffic data,
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.920]   or maybe it is in the internal mapping
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.080]   or in the transit area.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.360]   - Is the maps the scale they're getting better at?
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.080]   - Yeah, and also the scale of the problem
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.080]   of buying an existing map company
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.720]   and integrating it into your existing software.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.560]   It's not as though it costs just as much
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.000]   as launching your own mapping service,
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   but it's close enough that why would you buy a home
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.960]   and then put $200,000 worth of upgrades into it
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.640]   when you could build a house for $240,000
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:52.320]   that from the ground up is built to fit exactly what you want.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.160]   - Right.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:57.600]   - I mean, what does here have the Apple needs?
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.760]   Like what I have done? - Well, they have done,
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.040]   I don't think I'm familiar with them.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.680]   - So they bought, is Teleav what they have Renee?
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.680]   - Teleav Atlas and Navtech and Teleavt,
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.520]   - Navtech. - And two companies.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.360]   I forget what you're doing.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.480]   I always forget too, but they would no longer
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.280]   have to license stuff from TomTom.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:13.680]   So they would own their own deep map integration.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:17.280]   Here does have traffic, I think,
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.480]   it certainly could be added.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.960]   It's an excellent mapping system.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.880]   It's not that a place Apple maps, but boy,
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.800]   that would give them a leg up.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.560]   The problem is Google's been doing this for 10 years
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.320]   before Apple got into the business.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.720]   - Yeah, it really is,
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.800]   mapping really is a Xenos Paradox sort of thing
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:34.240]   where the first step is you get 50% of the data you need
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.160]   and that's easy.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:38.760]   The next big step, you're only getting 25% of what you remain.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.840]   And then getting the closer and closer you get
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.480]   to having 100% the harder the remaining data is.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.800]   When you get to the level of here maps
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.000]   or what Nokia was doing,
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.920]   you have to get to the level where you are actually sending
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.920]   people out to physically check out every building
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.360]   that your map data tells you is a hospital.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.760]   So that you're verifying that if you're gonna send somebody
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.920]   to an emergency room, that that emergency room is there
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.360]   and also verify that no,
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.880]   Nanak just could simply tell people that it's on this block.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.160]   I'm gonna steer them to exactly where the emergency
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.520]   room entrance of this place is.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.480]   And that's just one example of the sort of data
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.720]   where you need good detailed fine grained boots
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.480]   on the ground data that is really hard to just, you know,
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.760]   buy a whole bunch of Ford explorers and put goofy stuff
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.680]   on the top that then send people driving around
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.520]   from street street.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.360]   - They're doing that Andy.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.200]   - They're doing that too.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.080]   But no, but just as you say,
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.240]   with Xenos Paradox, you never get to the end.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:29.160]   Apple continues everything.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.720]   Buy's here maps.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.960]   I think, I mean, how much could it cost?
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.800]   Could 10 billion?
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.640]   It can't cost that much.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.520]   - You get a brokerage fee if it works now, Leo.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.280]   - It's up to deal, 10%.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.680]   - Why not buy Tom Tom?
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.720]   If they're already like licensed in Tom Tom,
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.400]   I mean, in theory, I don't know if Tom Tom is
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.560]   - Who they want.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.480]   - Well, but here's in play, we know here's in play.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.640]   And the problem is what you also wanna do is make sure
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:53.240]   here doesn't fall into the hands of Microsoft or Google
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.960]   or Yahoo or a variety of other players who would like
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.960]   to be players.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.000]   - I heard Uber.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.680]   - Uber, Uber wants to buy him.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:02.680]   And Uber, yeah, we were talking about this on Twitter
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:05.040]   about a month ago with Jason Calicanis.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:08.600]   Uber is heavily reliant on the maps application
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:10.960]   on the device you're using, whether it's Apple Maps,
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.560]   Google Maps.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.200]   And that reliance is a problem for them.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.120]   It's a vulnerability.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.080]   So owning their own mapping software will be hugely valuable.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.520]   - You never know when Facebook wants to buy it.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:23.360]   I mean, they had a tentative flirtation with Matt.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.200]   - It's gonna be smart.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.880]   If Apple wants to, look, it's if not an offensive play,
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.040]   it's at least a defensive play.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.360]   I think it's smart.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.320]   - I mean, Uber is an interesting target for all the,
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.960]   for all the good reasons that it's a very, very well known
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.680]   and well accepted sort of system that's doing very well.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.920]   But also you realize that you have how many thousands
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.240]   of drivers that are retracing popular routes
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.840]   through all the biggest cities in the entire world now.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.240]   That is a lot of great data.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.480]   If Facebook wanted to suddenly have access to data
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.840]   for restaurant recommendations, business recommendations,
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.840]   traffic information, they could get a lot of stuff
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:57.680]   with just one company.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:00.520]   But it's to a certain extent,
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.520]   it's you can't make the assumption that every company
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.880]   is for sale or that every company wants to be acquired
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.080]   by Apple.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.360]   You get to an Elon Musk situation where I will let you buy me
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.920]   so long as all you give me is money
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.320]   and I don't have to do anything you tell,
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.160]   you don't tell me to do.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.840]   I built this company not to sell it for a profit,
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.360]   but because I have a vision and I want to pace the stage,
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.960]   holding my hands like this and stand in front of a big,
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.840]   spinning map of the world as I talk about my worldview.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.920]   This is not something that could be gotten by a check
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.200]   for $17 billion.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.800]   - Yeah, I don't know whether Tom Tom is one of those
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.400]   but I do know here is, according to everybody in play,
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.480]   Nokia wants to get out of that business.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.400]   Benchmarks coming in from the French site Mac Generation,
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:43.720]   thanks to Mac rumors for the translation,
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.120]   looks like Apple's claims that the SSD
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:51.680]   in the new MacBook Pros are twice as fast are true.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:55.640]   Could bench reporting read speeds of two gigabytes,
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.680]   not bits, two gigabytes per second.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.520]   - Jesus.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:01.600]   - It's just silly.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:07.560]   - And write speeds of 1.25 gigabytes per second.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:11.280]   I think it's got to be as fast as anybody really would want.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.760]   What the problem is, of course, buses get saturated,
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:17.000]   you can have faster SSDs, they're really fast
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.280]   but the buses have to keep up
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.640]   and I guess that's what Apple's doing
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:22.360]   is putting these SSDs on a very fast.
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.720]   - Hardware team, I mean, as much as their design team
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.160]   and other teams get kind of their hardware team
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.840]   does amazing work.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.160]   - That makes it, that is not a,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.240]   you know, a lot of benchmark numbers,
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.600]   oh big deal, you're not going to see the difference.
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.600]   You will see that difference.
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.520]   - Yeah.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.440]   - That's a significant.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.880]   - It's a lot of IO bound tasks still,
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.160]   especially if you're doing heavy duty computing.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.280]   - I think that's the new, that's the frontier.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.360]   We all have enough RAM, processor speeds are very,
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.840]   very fast except on something like a MacBook.
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.360]   But IO, disk IO has really been a, the hold up.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.160]   So this makes a big difference.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.000]   - Yeah.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:56.840]   - Wow.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.600]   - Every time people ask me about,
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:03.400]   hey, I've got a 2008, 2009, even a 2010 MacBook or iMac
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.280]   and I'm considering either just upgrading it
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.760]   or just limping along or buying a new system.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.280]   And I keep telling them it's not just,
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.840]   you're thinking about how about a CPU upgrade when,
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:15.960]   when I tell you that having a SSD inside your system
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:19.080]   and having an operating system that's optimized for SSD
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.400]   and optimized for all the special little nooks and crannies
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.280]   are little features that are putting into the hardware.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.840]   The first time that you do a backup
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.600]   and you sort of turn away because you know
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.520]   that you've got three hours to go out and get waffles
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.520]   and come back and realize that,
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.880]   oh, private sparrow is actually halfway there.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:36.120]   - Okay, this is good.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.840]   - By the way, they're not, they're not even
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:45.320]   at the fastest they can go according to nine to five Mac.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.880]   The new MacBook Pro uses a solid state drive manufactured
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.120]   by Samsung, but Mac generation says it does not use
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.840]   the faster NVM Express SSD protocol
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.600]   that the 13 inch was updated to.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.200]   I bought the 13, so I should see that difference on my,
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.720]   I'll go run some benchmarks and get back to you.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:05.240]   But it sounds like they could even go faster.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.760]   - Wait, did you just do it, Leo?
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.840]   Did you just finish for this one?
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.120]   - I did it five minutes ago,
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.600]   but it's so fast it went backwards in time.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.400]   - Yeah, I don't have it with me.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.440]   Can you think of another marginal upgrade
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.400]   to the MacBooks that has had so much significance?
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.360]   I'm talking about, they didn't change the body,
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.320]   they didn't change the design,
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.440]   they didn't do it as a keynote level upgrade.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.440]   They just don't-- - They're still using
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.320]   Haswell, they didn't even-- - Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.480]   I mean, imagine already they've done SSD improvements
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.480]   that are transformative, they've done Force Touch,
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.520]   which is, I think is transformative.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.080]   And now we still have this lurking in the background.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:35.920]   Here's what's gonna happen,
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.720]   we have a real latest generation CPU in there.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.520]   It's almost as though they don't even need to shave
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.080]   another three millimeters off the thickness of the thing
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.640]   and start putting, start switching everything to USB-C
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:49.160]   because we're trying to make a desktop
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.680]   that's so thin you can't see it from one edge.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.320]   It's just enough to simply to keep what they have
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.320]   but just make it internally better, better, better.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.720]   Apple Watch orders, this was deceptive,
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.640]   but now I feel like I have learned my lesson.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.920]   I bought the headline that the Apple Watch orders plummeted
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.080]   dramatically after the first pre-orders.
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.040]   Yeah, they plummeted to 30,000 a day.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.200]   That's a lot. - Yeah.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.880]   - That's like more than the iPod or the iPhone
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.560]   when they first came out.
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.440]   So that's almost a million a month, 10 million a year.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:27.040]   Okay, that's terrible flop.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.360]   - Yeah, I mean, it goes back to that statement
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.760]   that if only 5% of eligible iPhone units bought one,
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.440]   that's still an incredibly, it's like 20 million
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.760]   or some ridiculous amount. - Did you have that mat,
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.120]   exactly. - Yeah.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:37.080]   - Gold watches are now arriving.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:40.880]   I saw it unboxing, an anonymous unboxing.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.680]   If I had a gold watch, I'd probably do it anonymously as well.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.080]   (laughing)
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.440]   - You feel like Beyonce missed a beat
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:47.800]   by not doing unboxing, you know?
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.880]   Beyonce, don't you understand?
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.140]   Don't you, I would,
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:53.080]   PERS probably did not come in a box.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.560]   PERS came in a Rolls Royce limousine
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.160]   with five Apple executives.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.520]   I don't think PERS came in a box.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.320]   (laughing)
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.520]   But yeah, do you wanna show the unboxing?
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.360]   Do we carry it?
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.520]   It has a gold, even the screen is gold
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.800]   when you turn it on.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.520]   - It's like the Vertu where a guy flies it
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.000]   to you personally. - Yeah.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.320]   - For $17,000, the entire thing needs to be gold.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.160]   - It's just everything.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.600]   Any gold, just all gold.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.520]   - It should all be gold.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.520]   And I love that the whoever's doing this obviously
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:23.920]   is not going to keep the watch
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:26.120]   because they're wearing rubber gloves.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:26.960]   So cool. - They're gonna sell
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:27.800]   the box the only way.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:28.640]   - Yeah, maybe that's it.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.160]   They wanna keep the box clean.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.960]   - Do you still have a two week return on it?
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:32.800]   - Do you?
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.440]   I guess you have to. - Yeah, we have to.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.320]   - Honestly, you don't know.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.560]   - But imagine the stink eye you'd get
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.400]   when you bring it back. (laughing)
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.880]   - Oh, but for the YouTube clicks,
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.760]   you'd get for a really nicely commercially done video.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.360]   - Yeah, we heard that they were gonna examine it
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:47.840]   for the microscope when you bring it back
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:51.000]   to make sure they even shave gold off of it.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.080]   - So that box, let's see how the box
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.800]   is with the blue lining itself.
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.680]   That's actually a charging box.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.520]   - Right.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:01.200]   - You can plug, I think it's a lightning connector
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.200]   into the back and the little disc that's inside
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.920]   is actually the magnetic disc.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.680]   So you can just plug it right in there
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.040]   so it'll never feel any more.
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:13.440]   - I'm guessing there's about 50 Kickstarter projects
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.760]   to do the same thing for a lot.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.960]   - Yeah, that's money.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.200]   - Well, there weren't how much they didn't get
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.240]   for like $300. - Yeah.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.080]   - Randy.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:22.880]   - How much could you get an eBay
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.640]   for the little plastic tab he just pulled off
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:25.720]   in the back of the digital.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.680]   (laughing)
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:28.400]   - More than an Android. - It'd be worth trying.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.480]   (laughing)
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.520]   - How big is that charging cable?
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.360]   - It's huge.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.080]   - It's pretty long in on the regular one.
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.320]   It's like six feet. - It's one meter
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.720]   and two meter versions.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.040]   - Do they ship the two meter version though, I think?
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.120]   With, at least they did with my stainless.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.640]   Yeah, 'cause I know 'cause I have it all looked up.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:44.480]   - Yeah, I think you're right, yeah.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.040]   - What a beautiful plastic band it comes with too.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.000]   - What, they ordered that plastic band?
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.800]   - That really says elegance to me.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:53.240]   - I made fun of that and then the new Rolex came out,
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.800]   which was $25,000 and had a floor last summer band.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.640]   So I'm guessing my idea of trendiness
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.160]   is not commensurate with popular.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.600]   - It's kind of a, well,
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.920]   but Rolex makes more than one watch, don't they?
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.160]   - It's a reverse strawberry.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.040]   - And this isn't their first impression.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.280]   We've suddenly decided to make luxury watches.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.520]   Here's the word, we may not ever have to make another one
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.040]   if we muff this one.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.600]   Here's your rubber band that you get for $10,000.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.200]   - If you have $7,000 more,
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:18.640]   you can get a modern buckle in.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:19.480]   - There you go.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.200]   God, that's just crazy pants.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.480]   That's just crazy.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:26.400]   - Cultomax says the pebble sales are dropping like a rock
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:27.480]   because of the Apple watch.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.320]   I don't know if that's true.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.680]   The pebble time comes out this week, right?
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.760]   - Nobody could get an Android Wear for iOS.
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.680]   The pebble, I think, was a de facto smartwatch
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:35.880]   for people who had an iPhone and wanted to--
[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:38.520]   - Oh, that's who's going away.
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.680]   The people who have iPhones.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.960]   It didn't really, I never tried it with an iPhone.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.560]   It probably didn't work all that.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.000]   - It wasn't as good as Android.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.440]   It didn't have its hooks into the system
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.320]   that it could into Android.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.160]   - It was still fun.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.520]   - I read an article on TechCrunch
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:54.080]   that apparently pebble needs more money
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.440]   and they're struggling to find any funding with it.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.400]   - Didn't they get enough?
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:31:59.760]   - Do they got one of them invest?
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:02.320]   - Well, but they, how much did they raise on Kickstarter
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.840]   for the time, a huge amount?
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.600]   - Yeah, but I mean, that might fulfill the orders,
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:07.640]   but if they want to consider,
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:10.440]   I don't know, they may have a really high burn rate now.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:13.320]   And it seems like they're struggling to get funding,
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.720]   which would kind of make sense.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:16.320]   I think the aim of VC,
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.440]   while on place I'm not putting my money right now,
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.240]   is pebble, even though they're an interesting company
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.040]   that's doing really interesting stuff,
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.240]   but looking at it right now,
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.520]   they're not the wearable company.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.360]   - Well, again, I think the smartest thing they did
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.040]   was to drop the price of the introductory model
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.280]   down to under a hundred bucks,
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.920]   'cause that's a wonderful value for less than a hundred bucks.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:37.640]   That's a great consumer choice to say,
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.960]   I just want to have a cool watch.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.680]   And oh, wow, really does cool things with notifications
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.120]   and stuff like that too.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.960]   It's the difficulty when they're trying to make money
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.880]   off of higher margin products,
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.080]   where I think they're being squeezed, certainly,
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.000]   that not, I think that the person who is eager to spend
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.240]   $400 on an Apple Watch isn't gonna care about a $200
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:59.680]   pebble time, but people who are interested in spending
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:03.840]   $150 on a good fitness band might not want to buy it.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.000]   And the people who have $200 to spend on a smartwatch
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.880]   are maybe are going to be looking more at Android Wear,
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.320]   especially 'cause Google I/O,
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.240]   their big developer keynote is in a couple of days
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.800]   on Thursday, and there are a lot of announcements expected
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.320]   about updates to Google Wear, and this is also good.
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.520]   It's interesting that Motorola,
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:26.040]   Motorola seems to be making a lot of Moto 360s available
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.360]   at really, really good discounts now,
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:31.280]   which provokes someone to think that perhaps they have
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.880]   second generation hardware on the dock and rate of ship
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.320]   sometime really, really soon.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:38.120]   And so if they manage to ship something as good as Moto 360
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.320]   or better at $200, you start to wonder why am I recommending?
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:47.320]   And if Google as rumored is preparing to ship a version
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:50.520]   of a new version of the Google app that allows people
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:54.080]   to use the Android Wear watches with iOS,
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:57.880]   I try to pick myself in the mind of what circumstance
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:00.960]   would I recommend someone get a pebble, a $200 pebble,
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.440]   and for now I'm coming up blank,
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:05.040]   so it's a tough situation for them to be in for sure.
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:11.040]   Microsoft is probably annoying Microsoft Windows users
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:15.200]   by its attention to iOS and Android,
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.680]   but here's something for you.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:21.000]   If you get Windows 10, you will be able to sync up
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.920]   with your iPhone or your Android phone.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:26.680]   A phone companion app will come with Windows 10.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.480]   You will launch it and pick the kind of phone you have.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.600]   And Windows Phone, of course, is the preferred choice
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.160]   but Android and iPhone are right in there.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.360]   And it will sync music,
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.680]   it will do your OneDrive thing,
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.400]   that's the storage, including the Photos app
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.720]   on your Windows 10 PC.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.360]   - It'll lure you away from iTunes?
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.520]   - Yes, no.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.480]   (laughing)
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:54.240]   - All these people who are now standing on the sidewalk
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.360]   watching iTunes burn in front of them
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.200]   (laughing)
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.280]   and holding a gas fan in their hand,
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.520]   now know that their other hand
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:02.280]   they can have a Windows machine, yes?
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.800]   - You know, this is such a strong move.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:09.000]   I'm so, and every time Microsoft comes out with new news
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.640]   about Windows, whether it's the right one for me or not,
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.240]   probably not, but it's, wow, that's a strong move.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:17.480]   Realizing that a lot of people who have iPhones
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.200]   don't have Macs and still,
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.200]   they've got the most popular desktop operating system
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.800]   on the planet, and if you simply say,
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.280]   "We don't care what phone you use,
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.800]   "we will make sure that Windows works great
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.400]   "with whatever you have."
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.680]   And putting Cortana, which in many ways,
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.440]   is one of the crown jewels of Windows 10,
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.000]   making it available, at least in some fashion,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.280]   on iOS and Android, that just,
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:38.560]   it provokes someone to say,
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.040]   "Hey Siri, excuse me, Hey Shlomo,"
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.920]   and say, "Hey Cortana," and see--
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.920]   - No point backing out of it, once you say it.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.000]   (laughing)
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.880]   - Double, I don't wanna trigger people's phones.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.200]   - But you did, and then the first thing I said
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.480]   was, "Hey Shlomo on it."
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.720]   - I did hear from one Shlomo via email say,
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:57.560]   "Please don't, I've already been hearing this around
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.960]   "and it's making my life a little bit more difficult
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:00.800]   "than it needs to be."
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.400]   I apologize to any Shlomo out there.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.640]   But yeah, but it's interesting,
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.960]   given that Cortana is the thing that people like to play with,
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.240]   and it's a really, it's a really strong effort,
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:11.320]   in many ways, it's superior to Siri.
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.760]   In terms of being a digital personality
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.040]   that you interact with, and this agent does things for you,
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:23.720]   it's hard to see where it's flagging compared to Siri.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:25.160]   Of course, you run to the same problem
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.520]   that Pebble ran into, where if you had the only person
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.680]   who has access to the full features of the iPhone
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.560]   and so you're never gonna be able to produce
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.360]   a third party product that can integrate as nicely
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:38.280]   and as tightly with anything that Apple ships.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.680]   Kinda sad, I would love to, in an ideal world,
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.440]   and I realized this is just a hypothetical ideal,
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.040]   I would love Apple to simply say,
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.480]   "You know what, we will release the APIs to everybody
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.520]   "because we feel as though if people were to compare Apple Watch
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.840]   "or Siri or anything that we make to any competitor,
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.280]   "they would still use our products because we're not,
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:59.040]   "it's not because it's relying on proprietary information,
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.840]   "it's because we've entered near this so well."
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.480]   I don't think, again, I'm not complaining about that
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.040]   with Apple, but I do sometimes reflect upon the fact
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.480]   that people don't have a choice in the matter
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:12.200]   that they are taking the products that are compatible
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.880]   with iPhone because it's the only product
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.440]   that is compatible with iPhone.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.720]   - So, Windows 10 fixes so many problems
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.080]   that I had with Windows 8.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.760]   I actually kinda like it.
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:23.920]   And I'm gonna be very interested, anyway, as you say,
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.320]   some many people use it by choice,
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.040]   some many others use it because somebody else
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.440]   made that choice for them.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.360]   If the upcoming version of the Music app
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.720]   will store and access music from OneDrive,
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.440]   which, by the way, offers unlimited storage.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.400]   - The only thing I'd suggest is that if you like this stuff,
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:41.200]   really support it because I have this feeling
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.000]   that Microsoft is trying everything right now.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.280]   Like they're doing the OS 10,
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.680]   they're doing the Cocoa support,
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:48.640]   it's Objective-C, sorry, they're doing all these different
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:51.040]   things and they'll probably put the wood behind the arrows
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.600]   that do the best and let the other stuff sort of linger
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.160]   or disappear, so if you like these things.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.640]   So a lot of people just use iCloud now,
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.000]   they don't even bother with iTunes,
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.840]   but if that's something that appeals to you,
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:03.040]   use it and be loud about it because that will encourage
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.200]   Microsoft to double down on the things that are popular.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.120]   - Yes, the Cortana app, which will be available on Android
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:12.760]   and iOS, isn't out yet, I don't think.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.560]   In fact, it's gonna come out for Android first,
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.040]   but it will be out for iOS later.
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.720]   Let me see, available for Android,
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.240]   end of June iPhones later this year.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.960]   Remember, Windows 10 doesn't come out officially.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.720]   Until they set end of summer,
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:31.960]   Paul Thorett, Mary Jofoli, our Windows experts on Windows
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:36.200]   Weekly say end of July, end of July is not so far off.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:40.600]   You know what, it's smart, if you're Microsoft,
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.720]   it's acknowledged as they have, people use a variety
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.000]   of devices and support it.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.960]   You're much more likely to succeed in an environment
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.320]   where you do that than where you say no,
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.840]   you have to use Windows.
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:52.520]   - When you're in Microsoft's current position,
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.120]   this is why it's moved to do.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:59.880]   But also to be fair, if Windows Phone were an actually
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:03.240]   successful product, maybe they would protect access
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:04.960]   to Windows Phone as they've got nothing
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:07.040]   with 2% of the market, they've got nothing to lose
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.800]   by simply saying we will make all Windows Phone products
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.840]   of software available everywhere we can put it.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:12.680]   - Exactly.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:16.600]   Let's see, I think we're gonna wrap this up here.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.360]   I think I had one more, no, that was it.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.200]   Let's take a break.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.360]   When we come back, our great guests
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:27.400]   from replay.fm, I'm sorry, relay.
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:28.240]   I always say that. - Right.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.360]   - Relay, because you're listening for the first time,
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.760]   Mike Herlay, tell us about relay.fm.
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.840]   - So, I mean, we've been around since August.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:40.000]   We've got a nice little stable of shows.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.160]   We have the great Jason Snell, Federico Vitticci.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.800]   To name just a few, we're growing all the time,
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:47.680]   and we've got some great tech stuff.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.520]   We've got the Panadic, which I know that you love
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.560]   the idea of Leo.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.840]   - Yes, I'm a Pan fan.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.520]   - Recently, MacPowie uses with--
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.000]   - Oh, with David Sparks, that's great.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.480]   - Yeah, David Sparks and Katie Floyd joined us recently.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.320]   - Nice.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:04.280]   - We're moving on, and we're doing great.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.160]   We have some great tech stuff, gaming stuff,
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.720]   and I think listeners of this show
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.920]   would really dig some of our shows.
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:11.360]   So, check them out at relay.fm.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.200]   - Very good.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.520]   Also here from imore.com, they have podcasts too.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.520]   Renee Ritchie.
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.920]   Everybody's got a podcast now.
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.800]   Renee, you got to bug-- - You got to buy all of us, Leo.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.400]   That means you get good microphones.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.320]   That's all, that's good.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.160]   I like it.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.400]   - We have Paul Kefasas from Rogamiba on--
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.240]   - Ooh.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.080]   - This week.
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.400]   - Love Rogamiga stuff.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:32.760]   - Michael, about three hours.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.440]   The final ed is not time.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.600]   - How long did you actually talk for?
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.000]   - About three hours.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.400]   Our record is still six hours,
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.000]   but this was about three hours and 20 minutes.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.840]   - I don't feel so bad anymore.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:44.680]   (laughing)
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.000]   That's awesome.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.920]   imore.com and the podcasts are there on the top right there.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.560]   You can, actually they used to be.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:51.400]   I don't see them anymore.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.440]   They run out of room.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.840]   - imore.com/podcast.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.840]   - So just go directly to imore.com/podcast.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.880]   - I think it's one of those things where it's responsive
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.240]   and then more stuff populates it as the wider it gets
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:01.320]   and then the things drop off.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.880]   - Believe me, I know how this is.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.720]   (laughing)
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.920]   There you go, there's look at them.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.400]   Look at all the podcasts.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.560]   Andy Inaco is also here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.120]   Thank God he sticks to print.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.520]   Well, maybe not.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.880]   - Although you can get it on phones on the web too.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.080]   I'm not just a simply ink stain wretch.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.280]   I'm not selling matches on the street yet.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:25.680]   - And there's also a knock on the flyby five.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:27.160]   We've just having a great time.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.920]   - I'm a podcasting gadfly.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.080]   - You have a gadfly.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.800]   - From my beloved home base here at Twitch.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:33.880]   - Whatever.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.960]   Whatever.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:35.920]   Let's take a break.
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.200]   When you guys come back, picks of the week,
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.320]   but first I gotta pick for you.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.160]   Braintree, payments.com.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:44.840]   Braintree is a really great solution for anybody
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.880]   working on a mobile app.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:50.120]   So many developers looking for a way to put payments
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.040]   in their mobile app and you could hand code something.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:53.480]   I think everybody by now has realized
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.000]   that's the worst idea.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.680]   Or with just a few lines,
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:58.600]   you could integrate braintree payments
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.320]   and start taking everything, not just credit cards,
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:05.680]   Apple Pay, even Bitcoin, Venmo Paypal.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.520]   It's all in there.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:11.440]   And boy, so many people now are using Braintree.
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.400]   You really, I mean, you get some confidence
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:16.080]   when you know that Uber and Lyft use Braintree.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:19.280]   Airbnb and hotels tonight use Braintree.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:21.480]   GitHub started with Braintree.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.960]   That was how they began taking payments
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.040]   and now it's massive.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.120]   In fact, you could do the same.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.520]   You could scale your business with Braintree payments
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.280]   from your first dollar to your billions.
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.160]   No matter how your customer wants to pay,
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:34.440]   take a look at that V.0 SDK.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.800]   They even have a sandbox.
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:38.080]   You can test the code on your own app
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:40.680]   and get a sense of what it's gonna feel like.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:42.320]   Very easy to integrate supports.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.760]   All the major platforms like Node.js, Python, Ruby,
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.760]   you know, I don't have to go through this with you.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.080]   You know what I'm talking about.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.000]   But I do want you to do one thing.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.160]   Go to braintreatpayments.com/macbreak
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:58.080]   to log in because if you do,
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.640]   if you decide to sign up for Braintree,
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:04.160]   you get your first $50,000 in transactions fee free.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.840]   And that's a pretty penny.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:07.680]   I haven't done the math,
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:09.800]   but I think that's not an insignificant amount of money.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.800]   Braintreatpayments.com/macbreak.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.800]   Just the feeling, it takes all currencies,
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.800]   the feeling you get of just how easy was that?
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.320]   Just makes it worthwhile.
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:27.520]   braintreatpayments.com/macbreak.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.080]   We're so thrilled that they support us
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.280]   just as we support them on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:37.480]   Let's start with Mike's pick of the week.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:41.560]   - So I have an app now I want to talk about today
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.640]   called Highball, which is a great app
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:48.240]   to share and collect your cocktail recipes.
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:49.680]   - Indeed.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.440]   - I'm a big fan of this app.
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:54.360]   It's made by Studio Neat who are behind the glyph
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.480]   and the Neatyskit.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:57.520]   They're a great little company
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.680]   and they make these,
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:00.120]   they make little companion apps now
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.840]   that go along with their physical products.
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:04.200]   So they make a couple of different cocktail products.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:06.640]   So you can create your own recipes.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.400]   They have some ones in there that you can find
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:10.120]   and you can change all of the ingredients.
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:13.600]   You can change all of the secrets that the names in,
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.600]   but you can also change the measurements and stuff
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:16.560]   that you want to add.
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.960]   They have a great way to add a little drink image.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:22.080]   Like you can, you kind of choose from different elements
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.800]   of a drink and stack them up together
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:26.160]   to make a nice little image as you see on the page.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.000]   - That's pretty, yeah.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:27.840]   - Yeah, it's very nice.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.760]   - It's like clear a little bit.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.040]   - Yeah, it's got a nice playfulness,
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:33.880]   but it's like really flat
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:35.680]   and just nice colors and stuff.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.400]   But my favorite thing about this app is
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.560]   once you create the recipe that you like,
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:45.840]   you can share the recipe card on social networks
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:46.920]   and stuff like that.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.520]   And if you see somebody,
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:51.440]   like you see it on Twitter, they share their drink
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.240]   and you take a look at the drink,
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.200]   you can save the image that they've shared on social media,
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:59.360]   open Hyball and it will import that,
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.480]   if you can open the image like from the photo picket,
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.880]   and it will then import all of the ingredients
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:06.640]   into your recipe book
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.920]   that you can then go in and amend.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.660]   So to use QR codes and all that magical photos
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:11.720]   scanning stuff.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.480]   So you can share them with your friends
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.440]   and then they can save your recipes and stuff like that.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.160]   It's a really cool app and it's free.
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:22.480]   And if you like any kind of mixed drink,
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.720]   it should be something you take a look at.
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:26.000]   - And who doesn't after all?
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:26.840]   - Indeed.
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.040]   - It is free, Hyball, share and collect cocktail recipes
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.720]   available for, it looks like iPhone only, yeah, iPhone.
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:34.840]   - Yeah, so iPhone, yeah.
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.600]   Who wants to bring an iPad to a bar though, really?
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.880]   Let's face it.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:40.240]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:42.080]   Great to have you, Mike Hurley,
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:43.160]   relay.fm.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.000]   - Thank you.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.800]   - Renee is gonna share his Jones.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:48.640]   (laughs)
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.720]   - Yeah, so I've got an obsession for bands,
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.720]   I'm not as bad as some people,
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.680]   I've seen some people buying really high-end watch bands
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.720]   for hundreds and hundreds of dollars
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:56.880]   and using those, I haven't done that yet.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:00.040]   But I have got all the ones that you can use with the watch.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.920]   The floral last number ones,
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.000]   these I really like because they're waterproof
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.840]   and they really do work really well when you're exercising.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.120]   Even as Georgia likes to point out,
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:10.240]   have sort of a concave inside
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.760]   so that it doesn't keep the moisture stuck on your skin.
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:13.840]   - I like that.
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:15.280]   - I thought that was super clever.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.560]   You have leather ones too that are really like,
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:19.880]   you have the classic buckle here, which really is nice.
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.480]   It's sort of stiff when you first get it,
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.800]   I've only worn it for a couple of days,
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:25.040]   but it does soften down as you wear it
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.080]   and that gives you a really classic sort of a look.
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:30.200]   And because Apple has this really smart slugging groove
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.800]   system, it takes literally a couple of seconds,
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.960]   maybe 30 seconds to swap out the bands.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:37.440]   The leather loop, we've talked about before,
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:40.200]   it's the stretch pants, like the Milanese loop of bands.
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.720]   And this just goes on both sides
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:44.120]   and then you adjust the loop magnetically,
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.560]   like you would the Milanese band
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:47.040]   and it just locks down
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:48.920]   and then you can keep adjusting it during the day.
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:51.840]   And it's leather so it feels really nice.
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:56.120]   It's not waterproof, but it doesn't keep water next to you either.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.520]   And I've been enjoying that, that's sort of like a casual band.
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:00.680]   And then the one that Leo and I got originally,
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.200]   which is the Milanese one, which is metal,
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:06.480]   but it's such a nice weave that it actually feels like material.
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.800]   - It's not its fault that it starts to look like an old DeLorean
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.360]   after a few months.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.640]   - No, again, I've had stainless steel watches before
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:14.600]   and that's what happens, especially the bottom of the band,
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:16.840]   which hits your computer or hits the table
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:18.600]   or the things you're working on.
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:21.240]   And you can get, I mean, this is an age old watch problem
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.600]   and they know how to fix that at jewelers
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.240]   or you can get the stuff on your own.
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:26.040]   - I have to say the watch hasn't done that.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.760]   I guess it's coated, right?
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.280]   - Well, they're both, I believe they're both coated the same.
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:32.080]   Which is the watch isn't on the bottom of your hands,
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:34.080]   so it's not knocking against the table on the computer
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:34.920]   when you're typing.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:35.800]   - Oh, okay.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:36.640]   - And all those things.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.480]   And then of course the DLC coated link bracelet,
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.640]   which I really like, you can get it in,
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.040]   I don't know if they sell it separately in silver,
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.600]   they might, they don't in black yet,
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.560]   but Apple will tell you, it takes about nine hours
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.440]   to make each one of these
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.080]   because all these links are actually slightly different.
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:51.720]   The ones at the top and the ones at the bottom
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:53.360]   and then the ones that go in between.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:56.120]   And I love that without, I've had link bracelets before
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:59.040]   and you actually needed a jeweler or a special set of tools
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.520]   to make any adjustments to them.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.720]   And this I just popped them in, popped them out.
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:03.960]   I had friends who wanted to try it,
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.080]   I adjusted it quickly for them.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.200]   And now Steve Aquino wrote a great article,
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.520]   I think on Mac's stories about how great it is
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.840]   to have accessible watch bands
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:15.120]   because he has slight palsy and my mom has arthritis
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.520]   and because of the loop bracelets and some of the other ones,
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.880]   it's way easier to put on the traditional watch bands
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:20.720]   of bands.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.680]   So it's sort of really great design
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.720]   that happens to also be really accessible design,
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.920]   which is a nice plus.
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.840]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:31.480]   Every time I got a new watch,
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:33.680]   I used to make a trip to the jeweler to get links removed.
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:35.000]   It was a pain in the butt. - Yeah, you too.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:35.840]   - So nice.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:38.120]   Do you carry links, extra links in your pocket?
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:39.200]   - I put them in the box, Leo,
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.640]   so I have to make sure I don't throw them away.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.760]   - And you carry the box with you
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:44.080]   and that way people can try and watch this.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.640]   - I've taken them out and kept them very carefully.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.040]   I haven't ever added any back in.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:47.880]   I've just been back in right away.
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.160]   - I have just discovered something horrific.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.760]   Now that I look at it, my stainless steel,
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.640]   for some reason the left side, not the right side
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.520]   is all scratched up.
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.560]   So you probably can't see that on camera
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.760]   if you're watching. - And you can buff that out.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.600]   - As they say on Antiques Roadshow,
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.320]   that's good, honest wear.
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.920]   - You can buff that out.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.440]   - Yeah, it's Indiana Jones look.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:08.440]   Leo, it goes on.
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.480]   - Ah, well thank God,
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.600]   by pick of the week is the black watch
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:14.160]   that I'm gonna get in a month.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:15.240]   (laughing)
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:17.000]   - Now it's a deduction.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.840]   - Yeah. - Oh, now it's a deduction.
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:21.640]   Actually, they said July.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:24.360]   But they've been shipping faster.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.760]   - They've been shipping faster than,
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:28.200]   that's like they're sandbagging you a little bit.
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:29.240]   They're saying, oh yeah,
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:30.480]   you're not gonna get this till July.
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:31.840]   - They would. - You get it earlier.
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.080]   - Yeah, they would rather exceed expectations than.
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:35.600]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:36.800]   - My mom's was supposed to come in June
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:38.120]   and it arrived in May, so that was--
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:39.000]   - Ooh.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.040]   - Yeah. - All right.
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.840]   - You know, the good news is I just got a notification
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.600]   from American Express.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:47.600]   Apple forgot, they only charged me a dollar.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:50.600]   So, little tip.
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:51.520]   - Oh, speaking of wishlays,
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.400]   as much as we were talking about the interaction model
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:54.880]   before, my mom got her Apple watch
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:55.960]   and I was busy working in.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.880]   By the time I got there, she'd set the whole thing up
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.440]   and she was using most of the features.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:01.520]   - Wow. - And she's mostly an iPad user.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.680]   - Nice. - She just, yeah,
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.320]   she went through and just pressed the buttons
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:05.360]   and followed the directions
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.920]   and she got herself going, I think, on almost everything.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:09.160]   She didn't notice that up activity,
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.400]   but once I showed her it was on there,
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:11.440]   she set that up as well.
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.240]   - The onboarding's very nice.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.360]   - Yeah. - We had to,
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:18.360]   Lisa's watch stopped responding.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.560]   She has the 38 stainless.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.200]   So, I went through the usual troubleshooting steps.
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.680]   I wiped it, which is no big deal because it's all backed up.
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:30.240]   That, it was not connecting.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.680]   You're getting the phone with a slash through it.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:38.080]   Then I tried to pair after wiping it, still wouldn't pair.
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:40.080]   You know, where it gives you that little space cloud
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.600]   and you point the phone at it,
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:45.080]   the phone never would see it, even though it should have.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.680]   And then I tried the manual pairing
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:48.920]   and that didn't, it's like the Bluetooth wasn't working.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.560]   So, I said, "Hmm, I don't know what we're gonna have
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:51.920]   "to bring to the Apple store, I guess."
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.160]   And then in the middle of the night,
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:54.640]   I woke up like two in the morning,
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.280]   "Wait a minute, reboot the phone."
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:59.520]   So, we rebooted the phone, not even reset the phone.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.120]   Just turn it off and on again.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.520]   It all works.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:04.200]   - Yeah, if you tried just cycling Bluetooth,
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:05.600]   that often works as well. - Yeah.
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.160]   - I think it was some weird Bluetooth thing.
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.720]   Her phone has always been a little sketch.
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:12.040]   She's a six plus, and she's always,
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.360]   you stood at the store page open,
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:14.560]   you should buy her a new one.
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:15.640]   (laughing)
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:16.720]   (yelling)
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:17.800]   - You can get it, apparently you'll be able
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.720]   to get it in rose gold next to this phone.
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:20.960]   - Oh yeah, with forced touch, right?
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:24.720]   I mean, the phone's gonna have new phones.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:25.840]   Can we wait till then?
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:28.120]   - You're not gonna buy her a rose gold phone,
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:30.360]   and then forced her to wear a watch that doesn't match.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.520]   - Oh crap.
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.560]   - You should buy it. - Candy and that,
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.120]   'co, you're pick of the week.
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.560]   (laughing)
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.720]   - My pick is the sort of app that I really, really like.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:40.880]   It's an iOS app for the iPhone called One Shot.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:42.440]   If you've been on Twitter, that's sometimes,
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:44.560]   for the past three months, there's a certain vote
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:46.400]   where if you're linking to an article,
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:47.440]   you used to try to figure out,
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:50.200]   "Okay, what 120 characters am I gonna quote
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.960]   "to convince people that this is a good article
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:52.840]   "you should read?"
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:54.320]   And people start saying, "Well, actually, I'm on my phone.
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:56.200]   "I just take a screenshot of a paragraph.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:58.440]   "I really like, I'll highlight it with a text selector."
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.160]   And then attach that as an image.
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.440]   One Shot is an app that tries to make
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.160]   that experience absolutely perfect.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.480]   - I like this, it looks good.
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:06.960]   - You're on your iPhone or your iPad.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:09.200]   You're looking at the thing that you wanna quote.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:11.480]   You just take a screenshot, then you launch One Shot.
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:14.640]   It captures that most recent screenshot.
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:17.520]   It will do OCR on the contents of it,
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:21.280]   and basically create a graphical quote from it.
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:23.800]   It would also, then, because it's done OCR
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:25.640]   on all the text that's on that screenshot,
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:27.160]   it will then search the web
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:29.920]   and automatically generate the correct link.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:31.800]   - Wow. - If it spotted it
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.120]   more than one place will give you,
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:36.040]   do you want it to link to this New York Times site thing,
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:37.600]   this thing on Gawker, or do you wanna
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:38.480]   (mumbles)
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.280]   this quote on Engadget.
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:42.920]   Formats it nicely, you can choose the font,
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.920]   excuse me, you can choose the text color,
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.200]   you can even highlight text within it.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:49.240]   And then, because you've connected it to your Twitter account,
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:51.320]   you just press one button and it gets tweeted out
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:54.200]   as all in one thing, and you can add text to it.
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:56.760]   It really is, all of this happens within that one app,
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:59.280]   and it's so easy to use that this really is the way
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:02.480]   that you're gonna want to recommend articles online
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:03.400]   to other people.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:06.320]   It's a free app because it was created
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:08.880]   by a couple of people who are veteran,
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:12.680]   ex-Twitter staffers, and they just wanted
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.360]   to build something cool, and maybe they'll add features
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.520]   to it as they go along,
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.720]   but they really just wanted to write a really cool app
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:20.560]   for doing this sort of stuff, and I'll be darned,
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.400]   they absolutely did that.
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:23.240]   It's really, really fun to use.
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:25.000]   - Installing it right now.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.640]   - Oh, it's free. - It's so ironic,
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:28.560]   'cause Twitter really made its bones
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:30.160]   because it was 140 characters.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.000]   That's it.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:31.920]   - It's a new tweet longer.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:36.000]   - And now everybody is doing this work around
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.200]   where you post pictures of much longer.
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:41.320]   - Well, because it's hard to, that's one of this,
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:44.080]   I will say that, but it's not like I spend as much time
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:46.040]   devising the tweet to a link of something
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:47.720]   that's just been posted on the Sun Times
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.400]   as I did writing the actual thing,
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:51.080]   but it's so hard within, once you,
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:53.320]   once the URL eats up some space,
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.720]   and after you on Sun Times eats up some space,
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:59.280]   what remaining 11 words am I gonna choose
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:01.480]   that convinces people this is going to be interesting enough
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:03.120]   that it's gonna be worth your linking?
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:05.400]   And it's so cool, like whether I'm linking to my own stuff
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.880]   or other people's stuff to simply say,
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:08.200]   here is the paragraph that said,
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:09.560]   "Oh, I gotta tweet this up.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:10.920]   "This is such a good article."
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.600]   - You know, it actually mirrors my workflow
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.040]   because when I go through news every day,
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.480]   looking for stuff for this show and all the other shows,
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:19.520]   I will highlight just as you did,
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:22.800]   the salient paragraph or one that I think is important,
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:24.880]   and then I use Pinboard to bookmark it
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:26.320]   and that paragraph gets copied over.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:30.240]   So, and by the way, that Twitter feed is links underscore
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.600]   for underscore twit.
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:34.200]   I often use Twitter to do that.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:36.880]   I might start doing that with links underscore
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:38.400]   for underscore twit because--
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:41.600]   - Yeah, I really hope that if I have a request
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.400]   before they move on to the Android version of this,
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:45.240]   if they wanna port it to other things,
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.880]   I hope they do it as a Chrome plugin
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:49.880]   because I do so much of my morning and afternoon reading
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:50.720]   on Chrome.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:53.040]   For the thing that I tweeted out this morning,
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.000]   it was a really cool article
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000]   about a digital security summit top secret at Bletchley Park
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.480]   between government spy agencies and representatives
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.080]   from Apple and Google and stuff like that.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.880]   And I thought it was such a good article
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:07.000]   that I so wanted to tweet it out
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.760]   that actually put, walked, turned away from my keyboard
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:14.400]   and picked up my iPhone because I wanted to use
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.160]   this really cool app to tweet it out
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:18.400]   and not cut and paste from this other thing.
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.680]   - You may actually make an excellent point.
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:21.840]   This would be a very nice thing to have
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.480]   as a Chrome extension.
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:24.480]   Maybe some other thing to do.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:27.960]   - I would be using it like, if it costs me three cents,
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:30.200]   I try to use it, I would be using it all the time
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:32.800]   and I'd be building about $15 a day maybe.
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:33.960]   - Yeah, 'cause no, but there's true--
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.560]   - Okay, maybe not that bad, but I'd be willing
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:38.880]   to spend money per use of it.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:40.560]   That's what I'm trying to say.
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:42.600]   - We didn't talk about that story,
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:44.080]   'cause I didn't really know what else to say,
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.920]   but the picture of the mansion is cool,
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:50.120]   where Apple and Google and GCHQ got together
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:52.080]   to plan our futures.
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.680]   - I understand the catering at that place is very, very good.
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:56.600]   They have those, it looks like a mini taco,
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:58.720]   but it's not a taco, it's actually a portabello mushroom
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:55:59.760]   sort of thing with the--
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:01.240]   (laughing)
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:02.820]   - Now you're just dreaming.
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:05.160]   Yeah, I don't--
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:07.640]   - Oh no, what I'm doing is I'm quoting,
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:11.520]   I was at the launch event for the Asus Zenfone 2,
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:13.720]   and oh my God, the catering at this function.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:17.560]   It was like lobster and then the portabello mushroom thing
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:20.080]   and then crab and then steak.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.880]   (laughing)
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:25.160]   Why yes sir, keep the entire can of Dr. Pepper, wow!
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:28.320]   - They know how to get those inked stained wretches in line.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.640]   - Feed 'em.
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:32.960]   - They know that we need to economize at any place
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:35.240]   we can get free protein, we will show up for that event.
[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.160]   - That's what show stoppers learned longer ago.
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.320]   - With Ziploc baggies.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.440]   - All it takes is a chocolate fountain and I'm there.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:42.440]   (laughing)
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.240]   - Andy and I co Chicago Sun times,
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.480]   that's where you'll find him,
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:50.040]   he is the king of Mac journalism and generally, I think.
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.440]   I can't wait to read your Mac book.
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:54.000]   So that'll be out tomorrow in the paper,
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:54.920]   but today online.
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:55.800]   - It should be out tomorrow.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:57.960]   I've just given them about 3,300 words
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:56:59.640]   and a bunch of pictures.
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:01.880]   I had it ready to go last week to be Frank.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:03.000]   It was actually on WordPress,
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.400]   and then I took it back only because reading it
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:07.400]   after two days of not reading it was like,
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:10.120]   oh, here's a way that I should rewrite that introduction.
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:10.960]   - Oh, he's a good.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.360]   - Fortunately, I don't have the responsibility
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.000]   that Renee has to be news all the time.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.920]   So that's why so much respect for what Renee does.
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:23.240]   It's like, I cannot form a good, valuable piece of opinion
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.320]   on something on quick turnaround.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.360]   It's like, let me think about it.
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:28.920]   Let me take a trip with something.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:30.480]   - 'Cause you have the requirement for value.
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.480]   That's what you need to do.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:33.000]   There's room in this world for both.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.680]   We need you both.
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:35.520]   - Absolutely.
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:38.000]   Just give me the bottom line though.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.360]   I can still cancel my MacBook order, should I?
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:45.520]   - The bottom line on it is that
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.960]   I don't think that there's another MacBook like it
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.800]   that is this good to travel with,
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:51.640]   'cause I took it on a couple of different scripts.
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:52.480]   - That's what I want it for.
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:53.320]   - Yeah.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:54.600]   - And that's where it really, really shines.
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.320]   I don't think there's another MacBook
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:58.560]   that requires so much adjustment,
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.960]   mostly because of the keyboard,
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:01.640]   which is not, to me, it's not a failure,
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:03.760]   but you do have to adjust to using this different keyboard.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.080]   - This is a sad thing, yeah.
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:06.560]   - But at the end of the day,
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:09.920]   the bullet quote that will probably quote with one shot
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:11.760]   is that I do think it's the most exciting Mac
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:14.160]   that Apple has released in the past three to four years.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:15.800]   (whistles)
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:16.720]   - All right.
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:19.360]   - Just don't expect it to be a daily driver Mac, that's all.
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:21.520]   - No, it's for travel.
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:22.360]   It's a nice way.
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:24.040]   - For people whether you're traveling,
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:26.320]   we're traveling a 30 minute bike ride
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.720]   to the coffee shop in the morning,
[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:30.200]   or 3,000 miles across the coast to a conference.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:31.040]   - Well, I have that.
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:33.720]   - It's not even close to the 11 inch MacBook Air,
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:35.960]   it's not even close to the 13 inch MacBook Air.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:37.680]   It's better than both of those, that sort of thing.
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:39.160]   So if you have that specific need
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:41.640]   and you have 1,300 bucks to spend on that,
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:42.960]   that's a good place to put that money.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:43.760]   - Well, as you know,
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:46.920]   Lisa and I are going on our yearly vacation
[01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:50.000]   in about a month, we're going to a river cruise
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.800]   and I want to have something like for travel.
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:53.640]   That looks good.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:56.840]   That and a black Apple watch would be.
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:58.840]   - It's not just that, I mean,
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:00.560]   on top of it being really, really small,
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:03.600]   not to open a new discussion, but the ability to simply say,
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.160]   I've got the, we talked about how much,
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:08.000]   how bad battery life is on an Android phone.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.360]   That's the reason why I have the 16,000 milliamp hour,
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:16.080]   like carton of cigarette sized, anchor battery charger.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:19.240]   And so when I plug that into the MacBook Air,
[01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:21.200]   you can charge it from this device
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:22.720]   and you can actually run it.
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:23.560]   - Wow.
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:24.640]   - The battery will not deplete,
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.080]   the internal battery on this MacBook will not deplete
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:29.600]   when it's plugged into a good high capacity battery.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.960]   And so now you go from having eight hours of battery life
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:35.160]   to having 16, like 17 hours of battery life.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:38.120]   And that's like, oh, that's such a great travel.
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:38.960]   Such a great travel.
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:41.640]   - I took it to show George Elio and she has the 11 inch air
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:44.880]   and she was upset first that it was smaller than the 11 inch,
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:47.640]   but then you open it and the screen has as many pixels
[01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:49.200]   as the 13 inch and it's another one
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:50.120]   of those optical illusions.
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:50.960]   It's just amazing.
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:52.240]   - It's like a chart is.
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:54.880]   - I always thought the 11 inch screen was very, very weird.
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:57.160]   I can never get used to the fact that it's squatter.
[01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:59.080]   And also the fact that not only is it squatter
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:00.760]   and smaller, but it also has that.
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:03.040]   That's the one screen that I really can't work with
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:05.560]   because I think that 13 inches is the minimum size
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:06.800]   for a non retina screen,
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:08.440]   or at least for me to be comfortable using it.
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:09.880]   And that's why I think that it's even better
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:13.440]   than the 11 inch even though it's credible to ask
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.160]   well, why not get the 11 inch MacBook Air
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:16.440]   'cause it'll have standard ports
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:20.160]   and has a better keyboard and has equally good battery life.
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:23.080]   Again, if you have the extra $400 to spend on this,
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:24.760]   I do think that it's a better solution.
[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:26.080]   - I agree with Andy.
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:28.720]   - And best yet with a nice black.
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:29.560]   - Hi God, Renee.
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:31.320]   We start a podcast or a website together.
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:32.400]   - A space black.
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.520]   - We'll call it, I agree with Andy.
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:34.880]   - Apple watch.
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:36.840]   - I just would work so well.
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:38.360]   - We'll have that sort of calligraphy
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:40.760]   where it means the same whether you're turning it upside down.
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:41.600]   (laughing)
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:42.760]   - Andy, I agree with Renee.
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:43.880]   - Yeah, it's beautiful.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:45.680]   - I did order the gold MacBook.
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:48.080]   Maybe I should just get the gold watch to go with it.
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:49.520]   - Black and gold look good together too, Leo.
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:51.440]   - Oh yeah, good. Thank you.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:52.680]   Dodge that bullet.
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:53.920]   Renee Richie, I'm working.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:56.920]   - This is like every YouTube video where it's like,
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:59.880]   "Oh my God, no, you can totally jump over that running car.
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.240]   You should totally do that."
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:03.960]   - It is, it's the jackass of Mac podcasts.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.920]   - Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:07.760]   - It's the most expensive Mac break ever, Leo.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.320]   (laughing)
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:11.400]   - Oh no, not by a long shot.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:13.840]   I believe I ordered a Mac Pro on the Mac break.
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:16.480]   - Well, if we get you up to the $10,000 watch.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:17.960]   - Then you would be, yeah.
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:19.120]   Renee Richie, love you.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:19.960]   Great to have you.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.680]   I'mor.com.
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:23.520]   And so glad to have Mike Hurley here.
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.040]   Come back soon, relay.fm.
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:26.880]   - I will.
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:28.000]   - We do Mac break weekly.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.440]   A little programming note.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:30.640]   We got some changes coming up.
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:31.920]   We got a new website launching.
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:34.720]   I'm hoping if all goes right,
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:38.360]   and I think I feel good, Monday, June 1st.
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:40.200]   At that time, we're gonna make some changes
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:42.800]   to how we do the live stream.
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.320]   In the past, for the last eight years,
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:47.720]   we have operated with unprecedented openness.
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:50.720]   I have allowed everybody to watch how we do the shows all,
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:52.700]   watch the sausage being made.
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:55.560]   And I really love doing that.
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:58.440]   It's something that's been great for me,
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:00.360]   and I probably would if it were just me,
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.560]   continue, unfortunately.
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:04.920]   There are some real harassers out there
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:06.240]   who've given us a very hard time
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:08.640]   and used our live stream to do so.
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:12.080]   And it's not just me, it affects my family, my kids,
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.400]   and all of our other hosts.
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:14.600]   So we have had, unfortunately,
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:18.440]   to decide to stop the behind the scenes stream.
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.080]   That'll be effective June 1st as well.
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.400]   Now, what that means, it's not gonna be a change for you.
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:25.240]   You'll still be able to watch the stream on our website,
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:27.440]   but what you'll be seeing is the final versions of the shows,
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.760]   the edited versions of the shows.
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:31.720]   And I'm sad to say no more behind the scenes stuff,
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:33.920]   because that's really what was providing them with ammunition.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:37.000]   We will continue to give you live streaming
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:37.960]   during breaking news.
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:42.080]   It's gonna be kind of like a regular television station,
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:43.320]   where you're watching shows.
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.960]   They will now be on schedule.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:46.640]   The O-Time no longer will apply.
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:49.280]   We'll be able to put those shows out on a regular schedule
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.080]   so you know when to tune in.
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:53.720]   We'll have lots of small interstitial bits to pad,
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:57.200]   which is great, gives us a chance to do some fun stuff.
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:00.280]   And breaking news will break in just as a television station
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:01.200]   wouldn't give you breaking news.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:04.400]   A minute there is a car chase outside of one infinite loop.
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:07.480]   You will see it live from the Twitch helicopter.
[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:10.640]   You'll also get to see breaking news events,
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:12.360]   like the Google I/O and WWDC,
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:15.640]   will do those live live, as always.
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:17.560]   But it also has an unfortunate side effect.
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:20.080]   One of the great things about doing live live
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:23.320]   is interaction with our audience, the chat room.
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:27.120]   That has also been an attack vector for these bad actors.
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:30.320]   And unfortunately, we're gonna discontinue that as well.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.600]   And I feel like I hate to do this,
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:34.840]   and let me tell you, it's breaking my heart.
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.960]   But 'cause I know our community,
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:39.240]   some of our community anyway loves being in chat,
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.040]   but it's just, it's very hard in our moderators.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.320]   You don't know the behind the scenes stuff they're doing.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.720]   We have been able to keep chat pretty clean and good,
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:51.840]   but that's only by did of extreme effort.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:54.280]   And frankly, some personal sacrifice
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:55.640]   on the part of our chat mods.
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:57.280]   And I just can't let that continue.
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:00.000]   So we will discontinue the live chat as well.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.840]   I'm telling you now, so that those of us, and I say us
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:06.520]   in the community can find another place to interact
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:07.360]   and hang out together.
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.680]   'Cause I know it's really important to many of you
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:11.040]   to talk to each other in the chat.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:12.320]   And I don't want you to stop doing that.
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:14.680]   And there are plenty of other chat places you can do that.
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.840]   But there will, IRC.tv server will be discontinued
[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:20.120]   on June 1st.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:21.480]   So just a little heads up on that one.
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:23.440]   Sorry to have to do that.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:24.920]   I don't think it will impact those of,
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:27.800]   almost all of our audience doesn't watch live.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:28.920]   Those of you who download the shows
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:31.960]   that we absolutely no change to what you hear.
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:34.400]   In fact, I think it might even be better.
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.840]   'Cause I noticed today I was paying a little more attention
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:39.440]   to what was going on a little less to the chat room.
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:40.920]   Thank you, Andy, Renee.
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:41.880]   Thank you, Mike, for being here.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:43.640]   Thanks to all of you.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:47.760]   We will probably have a new schedule starting June 1st.
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.520]   We will continue to tape live
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:51.760]   just for our hosts information
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:53.840]   at the same time, 11 AM Pacific.
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:57.840]   But generally speaking, it takes us maybe two or three hours
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:59.840]   to get the feed, the download out.
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:03.280]   We're gonna readjust our stream schedule to match that
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:05.160]   so you can get the final produced version.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:08.440]   So I would guess, and don't hold me to this,
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:10.280]   but we'll have a schedule published on the new site,
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:11.200]   June 1st.
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:12.600]   But I would guess you'll be able to watch
[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:14.600]   Mac Break Weekly, its first run,
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:18.440]   will be probably evening, Tuesday evening,
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:19.920]   early evening sometime.
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:21.560]   Add four or five hours.
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:23.320]   We'll get you the details.
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.680]   But roughly for all the shows, add four or five hours
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:27.440]   to guarantee that we have a produced version
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:28.800]   available for download.
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:32.120]   And the first live feed of it will be on the Twitch network.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:32.960]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:33.800]   We'll see you next time.
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:35.680]   And oh, one other thing, very important.
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:38.520]   Somebody asked me on Twitter and I absolutely want you to know this.
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.560]   We welcome live studio audiences.
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:41.400]   We'll continue doing that.
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:42.880]   So if you wanna watch Live Live,
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:44.880]   and those guys get to see all the weird stuff
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:47.600]   like my Michael Jackson shoes collection,
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:49.880]   you can go to tickets@twit.tv, email us,
[02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:50.680]   and we'd love to have you.
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:53.040]   We'd love to host you live in our studios in Petaluma.
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:53.880]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:54.720]   We'll see you next time.
[02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:58.080]   Remember, something important.
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:05:59.320]   Oh, get back to work.
[02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:01.120]   Break time is over.
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.280]   I'll see you next time.
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:04.860]   (upbeat music)
[02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:07.440]   (upbeat music)
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:10.020]   (upbeat music)
[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:12.620]   (upbeat music)
