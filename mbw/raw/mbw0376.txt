[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.000]   Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times with his cows and his shuttle
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.040]   Cows at the space shuttle the name of this show
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.600]   Exactly that's what's gonna be painted on the side of my new custom Chevy van that I'm having commission
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.720]   Some of them will have Pegasus wings and there will be a sort of a Tinker Bell sort of effect
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.880]   But we can't use the actual Tinker Bell, but it's gonna be quite quite impressive
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.120]   I think that when you when we when we go to the rally in four months from now, it's gonna be the bell of the ball
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.840]   I'm sure
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.120]   How about you Renee Richie I'm more calm
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   Hi, or you Leo. I'm good
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.040]   I'm tired
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.640]   I waited up all night to see if those stupid pre-orders would go live
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.040]   And then I waited up to see if I could get one did you get a mini?
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.760]   I
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.440]   Order ended up ordering too because the one I wanted is only shipping in five to ten days
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   And that means it'll get here
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.240]   I don't know yeah to Christmas
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.520]   So I ordered one of the ones that was instantly available and now like an idiot
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.360]   I'm refreshing the personal pickup options on the web page go right now to
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.640]   store.apple.com kids and get your mini while you can
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.960]   What is surprise that they they slipstream that I have found out myself last night when I got an email from a guy at Best Buy
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.200]   Who said I am holding in my hands and I pad
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.360]   mini with retina
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.720]   Because apparently they started arriving at the Best Buy's and they were allowed to sell them immediately
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.920]   So if you find the right story now, I of course immediately ordered an iPad Air
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.280]   Thank you Apple for letting me cancel
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.360]   And then figured out my air and there ordered an iPad mini
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.880]   One to three days on you couldn't get engraved if you wanted five to ten days
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.760]   You couldn't get anything more than 32 gigs if you wanted
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.640]   To Wi-Fi where one to three that's what I got the rest were five to ten. I got a 32 Wi-Fi
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.640]   Nope, if app if Apple were a different sort of company
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.640]   They would probably realize that look we got way too many
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.000]   We don't know how we're possibly gonna sell
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.280]   Macbook retinas with the with only 16 gigabytes of storage
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.640]   I know we will just basically have people wait two months for delivery on the 256 meg gig models
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.040]   They will buy the model
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.920]   They don't want if that's the only one they can get the next two or three days because it's the new thing
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.920]   Well
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920]   This is the other question mark
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.640]   Nope, nowhere in my area had pickup at the Apple stores. Does anybody reported that you can get Apple store pickup?
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.400]   It's supposed to go live some point today. Maybe tonight maybe around 8 p.m
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   And then you'll be able to pick them up tomorrow
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.240]   Most places some people are selling them some stores are selling them best buys, you know, whatever they've got
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.720]   It might be a handful, but whatever they've got yeah, and no one seems to know what they'll get in stock tomorrow
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.160]   So when you when you go at 8 p.m. It's whatever you get you'll just see what's available
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.800]   Yeah, anybody here in the studio audience. I pad mini with retina anybody. No, no, I thought that's why you were up early
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.120]   No, okay
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.680]   Rats anybody wants to come over to the brick house studios bring your mini with retina display
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.880]   It's not amazing now. I am under the
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.000]   Assumption that they're gonna be in short supply, but maybe not
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.800]   No, they are they are we know they're gonna yeah
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.720]   They're definitely gonna be short-packed if you if you really really really want to happen for the holidays
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.920]   You're gonna have to take pretty much whatever you're gonna get because I don't I don't hear anything encouraging about the availability of iPad minis
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:47.560]   Yeah, I still for a retail launch, which is kind of telling right all I have is ordered being processed available to ship
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.760]   one to three business days, but then
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.920]   Delivers November 20th to 22nd. Yeah, so I
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.600]   Something hankies going on I
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.280]   Felt for this with the air. I did second day shipping and it still came the same amount of time no matter what
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   It's an estimate Leo. It's not a guarantee
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   I
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.280]   Actually in the country
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.920]   Some stores have
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.440]   We
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.440]   Sorry my iPad mini
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.560]   Smart cover has already shipped. I love it when you order those things and you get the meal it shipped and you open it up
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.480]   And it's always just the cover or the case. Yeah. Oh, yeah, my red cover saw on its way. Yeah
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.040]   Just what I need look at these splits look at these split by the postal service delivers any minute
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.800]   Actually, they even that says November available ship within 24 hours delivers November 19th today's those delivery estimates
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   They're intentionally long
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:53.720]   Yeah, I mean especially with a cross border because you never know what it's right customs and everything is coming from China probably at this point
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.780]   Yeah, I'll even be curious to see if if these the first ones to be delivered have the same sort of like
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.060]   Slightly yellowing sort of prime that a lot of early devices have
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.200]   Exactly. I bet that a lot of adhesives were still curing on this on this thing
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.640]   And if this were the iPad this were the iPad mini sea with plastic colors
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.120]   It would be you'd see a little bit of red like rubbing off on the inside of the box
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.120]   Maybe you were dripping off the corner the package
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.360]   Thing is reviewers. I mean Jim Dalrym already posted his review reviewers were only getting them today
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.240]   So this is not you this is a not a normal product release by any stretch of the imagination. He posted his review even though
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.640]   He just got it
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.960]   It's not a huge difference. It's a retina display and Jim open
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.760]   He's used it at the Apple campus and then he used it when he was here and he wrote up his thoughts
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.200]   Jim doesn't do he doesn't do a Nantec style reviews. He does very experiential reviews
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.040]   So his is all about you no longer have the compromise of the retina display when you're using an iPad mini
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.720]   But I think it's telling that you know Apple was only giving these to the media reviewers today and you know
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   They're already shipping them
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.480]   So his review at a loop insight dot calm
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:10.520]   He's a mini guy like me us big guys like small devices it seems seeing Jim with an 11 inch MacBook Air is always gonna
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.280]   That's my biggest memory of him. It's like WDC with an 11
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.840]   He like me said the fact that the mini last year's mini had to never read the display was a sacrifice
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.840]   I was willing to make for the size
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.640]   But even though even when I landed in New York last night
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.280]   I reached for the mini even though I had the iPad Air in my bag
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.560]   So and I'm kind of feeling that to that I've seen and played with the air that I still want the mini
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.200]   Especially since there's no it's a no compromise
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.800]   devices here
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.160]   The screen size is still a compromise, but yeah in terms of tech specs
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.760]   I mean this was this was one where I almost refused to believe that it was gonna be technically on the on par with the iPad Air
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   because I figured that
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.920]   What incentive would Apple have to to into decrease their margins by even
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   Why would they put all the same components in the same thing if they could save three dollars and have three more dollars for the profit on a device
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.960]   That is not even necessarily intended to do all the work of the iPad Air
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.440]   So I was assuming that this would have like less application RAM or there be something different
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.120]   But if there's anything different between the two the only we're not gonna learn about until I fix it tears it down and gets
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.760]   So it gets the complete parts list they when we had that I fix it tear down
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.240]   We'll do a mini tear down as well as a PlayStation 4 and Xbox one tear down. We're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.280]   No, we're gonna tear everything down. Look these guys for everything they got
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.120]   But when they did the iPad Air tear down a couple of weeks ago
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.520]   Maybe just a week ago now chat chat wasn't that long ago week last Sunday? Yeah, it was less than
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:43.240]   Feels like ages ago. Yeah, well the one thing they could they said could be different is clock speed. Yeah, so
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:50.120]   That's the thing to watch I guess you know Apple doesn't reveal they don't even reveal how much RAMs in these things
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.480]   But only an end knows for sure only an on knows for sure
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   so
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.320]   Now on the site somebody's saying on the site they don't show the M7 processor
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:10.920]   But yeah, I think it is because Jim says of course the inclusion of the M7 gives developers the opportunity to use the data collected from the integrated accelerometers gyroscopes and compasses
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.520]   So he certainly implies it's there. Yeah, it's atomically identical except in size
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.280]   And possibly clock speed. Yeah, that's about the only the iPad mini
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.840]   He says can easily be your only iPad the fact is it always could in fact it was mine
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.360]   I mean I have I have always had other iPads, but they were at work
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:34.280]   I always carried the mini only but you could do so now he goes on without feeling like you're giving something up in return for the size
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.880]   The iPad mini is small it has a retina display and it's the most powerful iPad today
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.760]   There's just nothing bad to say about the iPad mini. That's the three hour again again
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.400]   I I have to I have to say having used both of them and having relied on the full-sized iPad
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.000]   There's
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.840]   spec for spec tech spec for tech spec. They're the same
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:01.640]   But I do still insist that there is a difference between the relationship between your eyes and your hands and a full on a 9.7 inch tablet
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   And the relationship between a smaller tablet if you if you really do think that you're going to be immersed in this device for work
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.480]   That lasts more than an hour or two. I really think that you will be pleased
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.720]   Well, I think most people would be we happier with the full-sized iPad than with a mini
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.400]   I don't think there's no difference between the two and I don't think the only the only
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:26.200]   The only opinion I've heard expressed that I would absolutely categorically say is wrong is when people say there's no reason for a full-sized iPad anymore
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   I disagree on that
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   I think you should have a choice though. That's all
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:36.280]   Exactly. It's kind of I do think that it comes down to an hour-long discussion can collapse down into two sentences
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:43.640]   Meaning that if you want if you want a mobile device that can run desktop class software
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:51.600]   Then you want the iPad mini if you want a desktop class apps in a smaller form factor than what you want is the full-sized iPad
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.960]   And I have to say I was you know, I've been using the iPhone 5s
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.280]   You know just because I want to give it a chance even though I'm kind of more so funny
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.120]   So yesterday or Sunday on Twitter. I was the guy with the Nexus 5 and
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.000]   Nick built in has a 5s Harper Reed has a 5s
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.800]   And who else was there that had a 5s?
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:20.960]   Chad forgot will will Harris and they all had iPhone 5s is and they all said your phone is too big I
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.120]   Said no, it's not it's just so it's really a meta personal taste but having
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:32.680]   Used bigger phones for quite some time now when I do go back to the the 5s. I find it very hard to type
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.640]   You know, I mean it's a retina display. So it's super crisp super beautiful
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.280]   But I just find it very difficult to type in passwords stuff. Look at you
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:48.440]   He's got a fine Nexus 5 and at 10 Lumia 10 20 and an iPhone 5s and the fact
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.520]   It does look small. I mean they do it feels small. I mean it's it's it's hard
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.160]   It's hard for me to really use it as a content device
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.960]   But the thing is that Apple Apple has their own like signature solutions to that where it's
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.600]   the
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:09.880]   Keyboard is smaller, but they put a lot more work into trying to guess what what key that you intended to type as opposed to
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.280]   Making the keys bigger so you can hit them more accurately
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:18.120]   So in terms of typing speed, I can't say that I can type faster on my larger
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:25.080]   Nexus 5 or Galaxy s3 than I can on the smaller iPhone what makes the other phones faster as other features they've put in but again
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:32.580]   It's apples apples guide is always to put as much intelligence behind the button and not put more buttons in
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:39.740]   Well, and so but I guess my point is you know for Nick built in will Harris and Harper read this wasn't too small for me
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.980]   It was it you know, they thought my phone that's a big
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:47.420]   Perception have what you want is the point and I think a choice is great. And so I like the mini
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.120]   You know ironically I don't and I bet it's too big for me
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.980]   And isn't it great that Apple did not decided not to put in these artificial distinctions and say that well
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:01.500]   We have to we have to maintain a marketing separation between the power machine that costs more money and the affordable one
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.860]   They said no, let's just put a sevens and everything let's be of them
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.620]   Let's not BS people like that people like there are people who want the larger
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.220]   They're people who want the smaller if you want the smaller you can't be talked into getting the other one and vice versa
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.020]   So why you why I hood wing people into getting less power than we can deliver?
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.740]   But that is not what they did last year maybe because they couldn't
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:26.940]   But it's very different from last year's strategy where there was a distinct difference in in not merely size
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.020]   But power and speed between the iPad full size and the mini
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.500]   And I think it's funny when you see people talk about it
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.820]   It's like they they look at the iPad mini and they say I could have everything that the iPad air has only smaller
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.820]   Or they look at the iPad air and say I could have everything the iPad mini has but just a bigger screen
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.460]   Right, it's almost like the glass half full glass half empty
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.780]   They have their preference and it feels like now they're getting everything they want in their preference
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.060]   It's no compromise, but it makes it hard to choose
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.460]   But at least you have the choice
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:14:00.140]   But I it does kind of underscore what I always felt and apparently a dalrymple felt about the last year's mini is that gosh
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.820]   If it only had a written display and now I don't even expect him to put the the latest chip in there
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.820]   I mean that's gravy as far as I'm concerned
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:12.380]   But that does this go back to the 64-bit everywhere thing that Apple wanted to do is that why they did that?
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:19.300]   Who knows I was I was trying I was trying to figure out if it had something to do with the retina display itself
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.660]   It's possible if there's a lot of support for it
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:28.180]   That's actually wired into the a7 and to put a lesser processor in there would redo it result in a in a degraded
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.300]   performance so
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:36.340]   So they had never had an ex chip in an iPad mini it went from an a5 to an a7 and the ex chips are quad core
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.540]   GPUs they're bigger they're hotter
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.420]   And then they're the reason why the a why the iPad 4 wasn't thin and light like the mini
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:50.380]   So it's highly likely that the a7 makes all this super thin and super light and retina and and battery
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.420]   Yeah and battery
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.580]   Well, we don't have a tear down schedule. I'm sure I fix this scrambling right now because
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:02.780]   We thought it would be out November 29th. You know, we're all kind of surprised that the mini is out with retinas out today
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.620]   Because they said end of end of November. This is definitely not the end of November. It's not even halfway through November
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:16.300]   Fabricasting I mean like the last I heard was a 20 second and then there was that Apple has this global service exchange portal where
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:23.980]   People who want to order parts or resellers go to you know to do their business and it listed it as becoming available today
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.700]   And I looked at it and it GSX can be wrong
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.460]   I mean someone could inter they could transpose digits. It could be 21 or 22 instead of 12
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:37.020]   And we was one data points. I was like that's crazy Apple will not launch it in the middle of the night without announcing it
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.700]   First out doing this and then the store goes down and was like all the stores down
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.900]   It must be coming but the store goes down all the time for maintenance and Apple listed it as being down for four hours of maintenance last night
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.660]   It was on Apple's status page
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.700]   So I'm still looking at going you know and I talked to a lot of people and everyone's like, you know
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.420]   There's no review units haven't gone out yet. That's tomorrow
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.900]   You know Apple's probably gonna want the reviews out before the units are all these things were like
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.580]   Oh, this must just be an error and then lo and behold three o'clock a.m. Is that when it was 3 a.m?
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:09.380]   Eastern 12 12 12 a.m. Cooportino Center of the universe time it went by midnight Cooportino
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:18.220]   So and I got I had to receive the email last night from a guy at Best Buy and I kind of wasn't sure if it was a hoax email
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:24.060]   I figured well, he's probably true, but it's bizarre and I got up in the morning. What?
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.260]   Yeah, so Richard divine and I more has one
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.460]   Yes, he he found one in England already
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.060]   They're in the future
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.500]   They're in the future in England. So he has he has the the first look
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:43.180]   He actually took pictures before he took it home. I love that that's dedication. This is at the Apple store
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.260]   He said I haven't even got it home yet, but here's the pictures. I
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.100]   Would have done the same thing had I had the chance
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:57.020]   Absolutely, I was I was really I was refreshing the page a lot to see if I could pick it up anywhere
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.020]   I was willing to drive to San Francisco to pick one up, but no one has one
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.300]   No, again your local reseller or your best buy or someone might and they might be willing to part with it
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.300]   Just by chance. Yeah, yeah
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:13.220]   Yeah, and you can't I guess I could have called I see I wasn't thinking I should have called Best Buy
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.940]   And and whips down there
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.100]   Well, I'm hoping before the show's over somebody will drop one off
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:25.500]   Not the scalpers not the scalpers. Yeah, they took a thousand dollars
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.740]   Got it gold
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.100]   So that's all the good news
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.620]   There's a lot of negative news to
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:40.900]   Will it be an IGZO exo display on the mini or because that's on the air, right?
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.620]   Display mates said yes, I asked Brian Clue get an ant tech because he's he's an optical engineer and he's brilliant
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.340]   He said he wasn't convinced yet and until he tells me he's convinced
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.620]   I'm not gonna write about it
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.940]   But display mate seems to think it's likely just because of the power efficiency
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.100]   They're getting off that panel to allow for the battery life
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.900]   indium gala
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:04.980]   gala indium galonide is zinc oxide gala galon gallium gallium zinc oxide
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:10.900]   $10 word I like saying that and it's pronounced Igzo is that right?
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.380]   Yeah, so the idea of
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.660]   Exo and by the way Apple never says exo
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:26.100]   I probably shouldn't either but but all the sonera and others who have looked at it pretty sure it is an IGZO display
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.540]   What do you get from IGZO?
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:36.380]   Thinness and efficiency so it lets it the problem with the iPads last year is that they required so much backlight for retinye
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:42.460]   Forget the exact number 48 or 36 or something like that and this panel allows them to do much more efficiency
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:47.860]   They have much fewer LED backlights which again puts less strain on the battery and the way the battery works is
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.140]   The higher the peaks when you put a lot of strain a lot of demand on it it drains faster
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.500]   So batteries aren't really getting better
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.860]   We're getting better at cheating them and part of cheating them is to keep them in a stable state for longer so this
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:04.820]   Exo is a much more energy efficient technology. It's not quite as efficient as what Amazon is using in the kindles
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:11.580]   But it's much higher yield rates right what do they use in the candles? I forget tea some some there's something even better than eggs
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:18.460]   Oh, yes, but it's harder to make so like when you're Amazon's using a low temperature polysilicon. I think that's pronounced lip-pips
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.420]   But apparently you can't make as many of those yet and Apple has to you know
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.660]   They always they're they are in some ways victimized by the amount of iPads they have to make right
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.940]   IGZO
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.980]   according to
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.980]   Senera
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.220]   Was it it was good
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.980]   Significantly better electron mobility
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.260]   That's what you want
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:51.060]   Retina to you in our klight minutes Leo, you know, you got open with a kid and get an adult beverage. They reached up the electrons
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:57.060]   It's like it's like pornography has to slide into harder and harder core
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.960]   You know simulation. It's like you got you you can't now just simply like put it
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.880]   Up a page and say here's how readable it is and with distance now. I have to say well
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.560]   I'm I'm getting a higher angstrom count on the reflectivity of the red
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:18.840]   It seems like it says it's supposed to be 66 80 angstroms. I'm getting seven thousand. I think I think
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.360]   Well, I said I sent off a couple pixels discern for
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.520]   Embardment when we get their results back in three month, then we'll finally settle this issue
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.320]   I'm I'm still back in double twist displays. I don't know
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:41.920]   Yeah, I don't understand this stuff. So sick so they've got significantly improved significantly improved electron mobility or sebum
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.880]   And that means a 57 percent power efficiency
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.760]   They make they make the electron traces out of large now. So it's nice and slippery
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.200]   You don't you don't have any electrons getting clogged up in the field
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.880]   You don't have to change the electron filters in this device as often as you had to with the old technology
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:08.680]   So Nara says Nara says compared to the fourth generation screen with reflectance is decreased by 23%
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.320]   Peak brightness increased by 7% this is on the air
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   But presumably the retina would the mini would have the same benefits contrast rating if it has an exo display
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.440]   Contrast rating for high ambient light increased by 32%
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.880]   Absolute color accuracy and image contrast fidelity very good below the fire
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   a little bit
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:35.360]   So yeah, Izzo is a is a good movie expected Izzo we were we were thinking exo all along
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.360]   Every year they rumor exo and once you know once eventually they'll be right right yeah
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.880]   Indian how
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.960]   Gal okay, I'm not gonna try I
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:52.640]   Want to say indium gallium indium gallium zinc oxide. I think I'm gonna write now
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.360]   I'm this gallium and part is trace de visa
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.400]   The gala's wars very good
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.520]   Ten points to the man in that black
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.520]   Yeah with his CU he's a buff
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:14.400]   Is CU shirt on my son. Thanks you there you go. Yeah, I'm sure whatever contribution
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.560]   I've made to whatever building fund that now you as the parent of a student does not have to pay for
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.920]   I'm happy. I've learned now that he's going to be living in the Sigma Pi house starting next year
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.920]   So I don't think it matters anymore
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.040]   But if you want to contribute to the toga fund
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.280]   You're more than welcome
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:40.360]   I'll send him a case of epic act just in case when Henry was born Henry's a freshman at the universe of color
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.880]   Out of Boulder when Henry was born we said he was born in a toga we I mean the kid from it's so amazing
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.880]   We knew he was gonna be a frat boy
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.360]   It was just like he was made for it
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:55.720]   I'm trying to unpack exactly what that means
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:03.960]   I mean the guy was like you know when he was born he was born he was covered with sickening fluids intended to cry and scream and
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.200]   Bimpukolot so I suppose yeah, yeah, that's it right
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:13.560]   There is just from it from you know, I have a picture of him like four years old going I
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   Mean the game winking thumbs up. He was a bro from way back. All right back to 17% glass 70% touch sensor
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:28.520]   Improved retina display. I'm excited. I can't wait to get my mini. I can't wait
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.040]   Of course the reason I bought the original mini was to play
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.360]   Simpsons tapped out. I'll have to find a new game now
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:43.480]   How you can do that in retina retina tapped out retina tapped out. Oh, I would if they'd fixed it so
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.260]   They
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.160]   Electronic arts you owe me 1400 donuts. I'm just saying
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.320]   This brings up now that we've gone through Iggzo sapphire
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:02.680]   We I don't know if we mentioned this last week. I don't think I think it happened after the show last week Apple bought
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.240]   Into a big sapphire production
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.520]   company
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.940]   Sapphire I know from watch watch crystals is very hard harder even than gorilla glass
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.680]   It has some negatives, you know, I mean, it's not it's not you know
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.880]   You're there's trade-offs
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.880]   But it is a harder and Apple does use sapphire apparently to protect the button here on the home button, right?
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.080]   And there's sapphire used to protect the camera sensor
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.880]   But this multi-year alliance with GT advanced technologies
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.160]   Apple has apparently paid more than half a billion dollars to this company
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:44.120]   It's a cut that's the kind of money where you're buying up all the sapphire production for the next five years if you ask me
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:54.240]   And the thought is well, could it be that they just they want more of these sensors and more of these cameras or
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.440]   Might it be they want to use sapphire for something else
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.160]   Bum bum bum
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:07.200]   Like a watch maybe like exactly like maybe a watch. Yeah, although it is harder than gorilla glass
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.240]   So if you wanted to
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:17.400]   You know make a I mean it would be a selling point. Yeah, this is the article that tech crunch articles pretty good
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   There's a follow-up that pans we know did as well where he explained some new process that used like an ion
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.840]   Cannon to shear off atoms so they could make super thin ones and bond them with glass
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.880]   And so they can make much more of them cheaper and you know the way to use an Intel display now
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.880]   But they could do the same thing with sapphire
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:42.000]   Instead at a much higher yield and a much cheaper price than was possible before you're talking about of course the Hyperion ion
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.080]   Canon yes
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.920]   As all you know good-hearted nerds know I want one. I don't even know what it is
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:54.360]   I just like the name and then on a shark. Did you see the picture of the Hyperion ion Canon?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.560]   That looks dangerous that looks like that could be the Empire's
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.320]   Technology it looks like it could heat up your burrito in less than three seconds
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:11.000]   Yeah, a lot of watches have these but the pro of course the issue is making them bigger
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.800]   But also you know bigger sapphire displays, but also I think
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:24.200]   Not merely bigger, but it's a changing some of the characteristics of sapphire, which is not ideal. It does change their the refraction
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.160]   Getting into your angstroms talking about your angstroms over there mr.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.160]   You're an echo an
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.240]   ion Canon allows
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.400]   Twin creeks to place wafers around the edge of the device smash them with hydrogen ions
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.760]   and they with
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:50.240]   The accumulate 20 micrometers from the surface of each wave wafer a robotic arm then transports the wafers to a furnace where the ions
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.640]   here's the trick
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.200]   Expand in the hydrogen gas causing that 20 micrometer thick layer to shear off
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.760]   Love this part
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:10.600]   Basically you get really you don't have to saw the sapphire you can have a 20 micrometer thick piece of sapphire
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.120]   They do it in solar panels apparently
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.680]   Right now the cost of sapphire sapphire display $30
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:29.440]   MIT said that or somebody in the MIT technology review said they probably thought it dropped to 20 bucks in a couple of years
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.240]   Grilla glasses less than $3. So it's a very expensive technology
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:39.480]   You can just see this in the apple video you can see Johnny. I've talking about the hyper ion Canon blasting away ready
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.280]   Apple did fire a patent called sapphire laminates
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.040]   In which it discusses a variety of ways to laminate sapphire sheets together with other sapphire sheets or with glass
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:56.760]   Mmm. We know that when you one of the features of laminating a product is that you can make a curved piece of glass very easily. Oh
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:02.840]   I think that you're right
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:08.240]   I think that if if and when Apple comes up with a watch half of it is is gonna go into the half of the demonstration is gonna
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.920]   Go into the construction of the thing because I think that this will
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.520]   Apple had their hands their hands full with the iPhone
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:20.520]   Prousing a phone that would look okay when it's inside a lint-filled pocket full of keys and coins and stuff like that
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:26.320]   But when you have like a device on your wrist that is exposed the elements is gonna be sweated on it's gonna be
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.320]   You get one of these he-manly arms with all these filthy little hairs on it
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.880]   Also the American building industry now
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.560]   I am exactly average height for an American male and it means that if I'm wearing a watch
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:45.360]   It is exactly the watch when I'm walking and swinging my arms is at exactly the right height to basically bash into a metal doorknob
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.980]   And every watch I have has like some scratches right here from where it hit when it hit a doorknob
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:56.760]   And I think that that's gonna be one of the biggest issues Apple's gonna have if if I wonder how much more difficult the process
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:02.120]   Would have been if Steve were around and still able to say no categorically no a thousand times
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.160]   No, we are not gonna do a watch that looks like this after four months
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:13.120]   And I it's it's it's gonna be it's gonna be such a struggle. I think well as long as we're doing materials science
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.400]   This material science portion of the show brought to you by gazelle.com. Let's mention
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:22.120]   Global foundries which is a little little chip fab up in upstate New York
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:28.600]   John I'm sorry Eric Hasseldahl at all things D says don't get too excited
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   About this story it came from the Albany Times Union
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:40.480]   Saying that app that Apple may start using global foundries to turn out chips the for the iPhones and iPads
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.160]   Apparently it's merely it doesn't mean Apple's abandoning Samsung
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:51.100]   It merely is what they call flex capacity ability to and when it when needed
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:59.120]   Turn up capacity a little higher it goes to 11 thanks to global foundries. They have the right to abandon Samsung, but they lack the capacity
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.800]   That's right
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.160]   That's right or to summarize it. I just can't quit you
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:12.760]   Yeah, I mean how many I mean, you know, I mean good lord the number of devices. They're cranking out
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.400]   Yeah, it's a big order. Yeah, yeah
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.760]   Although the idea of a chips on an Intel 14 nanometer fab is
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:28.480]   Nerd dream worthy is that what global foundries does their 14 anime? No only Intel but Intel started doing some arm chips
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:34.920]   So right isn't that interesting? Yeah, and that's basically capitulation Intel which makes the x86 chips
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.400]   They can never get anybody to use in mobile devices only
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:45.200]   Desktop clasps devices pragmatically. Oh, it's it's bay trail pragmatism. It's yeah, right
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.960]   They keep to you know, they kept trying to make mobile chips nobody wanted them
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.520]   So what the hell let's make some arm chips. We got the fabs
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:02.680]   Arm arm which was started by apple with a corn way back when apple divested a long time ago
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.400]   Is not is it what they call a fabulous foundry?
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:11.400]   They don't they just design them and then other companies like Samsung and TI and others make them
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:18.960]   So Intel could easily just license it and make it and the nice thing about Apple is that they they make money off the whole phone
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.960]   They don't have to worry about making money off each component
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.240]   Which a lot of vendors do like a lot of Qualcomm has to make their money on the chip, right and the display company Apple doesn't care if
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.680]   They lose money on the chip or lose money on this as long as they make money on the phone
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.180]   So they can invest in a lot of stuff that for the a7 that you know
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:38.440]   Qualcomm couldn't do if they're selling it to another company imagine the pressure that apple puts on its suppliers to keep costs low
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.080]   and
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.520]   That brings us to the depressing portion of the show if you wish to fast forward
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.160]   I wouldn't blame you Bloomberg business week article by can't
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.000]   Cam Simpson
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.260]   Really if you read it, I think you should read it and it's not by the way just iPhones not just iPads
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:03.160]   It's every bit of electronic gadgetry from our TVs to our dishwashers to our microwave ovens to our phones to our cars even Ford
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:10.400]   and other car manufacturers do this basically the supply chain goes back to Malaysia
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:17.440]   And other and countries like that the Philippines where they're getting workers in basically very
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.680]   nasty ways and
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:26.640]   This article which talks about in particular one worker who was recruited from Nepal and
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.000]   Brought to Malaysia
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   The way the recruiters work even though appers rules say the recruiters are not allowed to the brokers the
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.720]   Workbrokers in Nepal and other countries who bring in these workers are not allowed to charge more than a month's worth of salary
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.640]   These jobs are in such hot demand
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   in places like Kathmandu
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:55.200]   That these brokers can really extort a lot of money from these guys
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.640]   So they tell the story of flex tronics, which is in Malaysia
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:09.720]   Apple said we need a lot of cameras for the iPhone 5 flex tronics, which makes that camera part
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:16.160]   Hire sub recruiters going to Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam the Himalayas
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:25.280]   For the iPhone 5 rollout a recruiter working for flex tronics. I'm reading from the Bloomberg Business Week story contacted four brokers in Kathmandu
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:33.080]   Urgently seeking 1500 men to make cameras according to three of the four brokers the pressure to move so many men so quickly was unprecedented
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.320]   We'd need these workers. You have to send them today. They said and
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:42.760]   So they tell the story. It's such a tragic story of one of these workers
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.760]   Who in order to get the job had to borrow
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:53.640]   From a you know a basically a loan shark in Kathmandu
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.280]   torrential rains had destroyed his home
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.120]   He needed a job
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.240]   And he borrowed
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:08.760]   250 he paid $250 to a recruiter who then connected him to a broker in Kathmandu
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:13.720]   He ended up borrowing another $350
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.080]   He had to bring $500 or six months of his wages
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:23.200]   To get to the airport they take his passport he arrives
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:33.920]   He's working for very he had at a thousand dollars in debt before he started the job basically and that's a lot of money when the job
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.640]   pays $178 a month
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.000]   107 12 hour shifts
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.920]   You get up at five you get on the bus you arrive at 7 a.m.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.400]   12 hour shifts
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   And you're barely making enough money, but the worst part is in this case the lenses were rejected by apple
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.840]   The re he was he was a tester
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:09.600]   In november dong his name is and the other men say they noticed the number of failures appeared to be growing production slowed to a drip by the end of the month
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.320]   They were all laid off and then because they didn't have their passports
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.400]   They they stayed in their living quarters for 20 days food ran out. They can't go anywhere
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.040]   It's really tragic the guy ended up getting home eventually but still owes
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.160]   a lot of money
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.240]   um
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.160]   To brokers to lawn sharks that he borrowed the money from so he could get this job
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.040]   So what does he have to do he has to turn around and go back to another job where he is again
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.480]   A Vic could be easily a victim. He's got he's working in a shoe factory for $3 a day
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.080]   He's got $300 in annual interest
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.520]   Um
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:55.280]   The thing that's very sad about this story is this is how this stuff is made and you know
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.840]   You could talk and we do talk about the factories in shun gen and i think they're making improvements there
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.760]   But those are just the assembly you can even talk about the mojo x which is assembled in texas
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.840]   Underhumane conditions, but they still get the parts from these companies like flex tronics
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.840]   It's
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.720]   Kind of sad i don't there's then there's not much apple can do apples trying to enforce these
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.840]   uh new rules
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.280]   But uh, it goes to you know, it's too too too distant
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   Frankly for them too. They can't control what's going on in catman do
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:31.120]   Very sad story and you guys are just wisely shutting up
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.400]   I mean, it's horrific. Did you read it? What?
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:43.120]   Terrible. Yeah, I mean, what what can you say? I mean, these are events that you just it's it's as close to slave laborers
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:48.720]   You get because these guys have no choice right? It seems it seems vulgar to comment on them because the
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:54.400]   Reprehensible nature of how people can some people will exploit
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.440]   Other people speaks for itself. You can't um you you can't embroider that with anything
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.560]   So it's not and i'm very want to be very clear not blaming apple at all. No, of course not
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.480]   Uh, this is and it's in some ways. It's us because we buy this stuff
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.840]   I guess all you can do is buy less of it keep it longer
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.520]   There's enough blame to go around and apple gets its fair share of benefits from being one of the world's biggest companies and one of the drawbacks
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:22.880]   Is that when there's something like this happens they get the equal and opposite attention for this situation? So it's it's entirely fair
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.480]   Yeah, and there's nowhere else to go. I mean
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:34.080]   You you can assemble as as motor roll is doing in the uh, us as four does in many cases, but you still have to make these
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.280]   Pro will be done that you still have to buy these parts. Yeah
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.360]   Yeah, so I don't know. I don't know what to say about it
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:47.280]   You hope as a species will mature to the point where it no longer happens globally rather than just local
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.760]   Yeah, and it can't hide your head in the sand about it and we just have to keep raising the issue
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.800]   Yeah, I mean that not not to get cynical, but I mean it's it's like there's almost no point
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:04.000]   No, no part of any story that involves really good technology that doesn't involve human suffering or it doesn't
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.080]   inspire somebody to
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.840]   to to express the base or nature of
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.720]   occasional human existence. Yeah, just like when you
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:20.160]   There's a great story. It's a great success story when a school district that's full of kids that are don't have as many advantages as the rest
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.560]   Get get a grant money get to pursue appropriations so that every kid can have an iPad
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.280]   And only tommy days is a take before the local criminal element decides. Oh, great
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.680]   So a bunch of eight nine ten year old kids are going to be carrying around five hundred dollar easily resellable devices
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.320]   So let's just let's just make sure we have a system. We don't we don't try to mug the same kids twice
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.160]   We're going to systematically make sure that none of these kids go home with those iPads and
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.600]   It's like it's terrible that when you think about the
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.480]   when you think about how wonderful
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.000]   and
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.680]   beneficial this the technology can be if only people would get out of the way of the good thoughts and the good intentions
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.400]   And you just it's it's terrible that every time you think about
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.640]   as something as as lovely as an iPhone 5s or as as
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.760]   Innovative as the Moto X or anything that you really really like, you know that that's you don't have to dig too far down before you find human suffering
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.160]   So yeah, don't you don't tear out your you know tear out your heart about this
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.720]   Try take action where you feel it's appropriate
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:21.680]   But real just I think it's enough to make sure that you never simply forget that such things are happening
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:28.400]   Yeah, that's why I bring it up. It's a downer. It's a very very sad here. It's so sad and read the story, please
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.920]   just so you know
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.520]   you know
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:38.640]   And I just don't know what the there is really no obvious solution except just to let's do better kids inform people a olek you just did
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.240]   Yeah
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.520]   Well and all credit to bloomberg business week which wrote which must be especially for a business journal
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.560]   Uh a difficult story for them to report on
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.440]   um
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.520]   Just uh it's sad
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.600]   We're gonna take a break when we come back happier news not really I work what happened
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.880]   Uh now even john lewy gase is just and uh, you know, uh, we'll talk
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   No, no, no
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.240]   Sacre bleh
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.240]   Uh, we'll
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:19.680]   We'll talk about other happier things and why google has not one in the map war
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.200]   But first let's say there's one thing you can do
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:28.320]   Uh, if you have a gadget is not just throw in a drawer or throw it in the landfill heaven for fenn
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.040]   But recycle it the right way with gazelle sell it to somebody who wants that gadget
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:38.240]   That's one less gadget being made one less gadget in the landfill and it's some bucks in your pocket gaz
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.640]   Elle
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.520]   Dot
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.400]   Com if you're all hot and bothered you have the old ipad
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:49.360]   Uh mini with retina display by the way, they not only buy apple tablets, but amazon
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:57.760]   A sus google they'll buy surfaces from microsoft samseung tablets, but let's say you have a uh ipad mini and you're going
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:07.120]   Uh, uh, I want to get that nice uh 255 dollars on a good condition 64 gig ipad mini with lte
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.760]   That's a great deal
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.760]   This is what gazelle does so well. They buy this stuff. They sell it on ebay
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:19.920]   They have a special gazelle store on ebay, which is great by the way if you want to buy a lightly used well-taking care of device
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:26.400]   Uh, you can you can sell your stuff on gazelle get cash in your pocket for your next device and make sure somebody's using that
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:33.360]   Old device appropriately even ipods apple tv's apple displays macbooks i max
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.640]   They even buy blackberry cell phones
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:42.640]   HTC lg motor roll and nokia and samseung visit gazelle.com gaz
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.680]   Elle the way this works
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.320]   You know, you're not going to get your mini even if you order it today
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   You're not going to get your mini for a couple of weeks, right?
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.000]   So the way this works is you get a quote for 30 days get that quote now
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.560]   I guarantee you the price goes down on every one of these things as they get older, right?
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.120]   So get the quote now you're locked in for 30 days
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.080]   It doesn't mean you just have to send it to them immediately you have 30 days to decide whether you're going to take advantage of the offer
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.800]   They will send you a prepaid mailer. So you don't have to pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:16.720]   Uh, and uh, and once you've and by the way, don't just sell the senate one thing get rid of everything in that drawer
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.120]   I just did that I have a box
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.840]   I should have showed you my box. It's in the trunk of my car of all this stuff because I moved
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.880]   I have a gazelle box. It is it's maybe a hundred pounds
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.080]   Of stuff. I'm gonna sell send the gazelle. I'm so excited
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.720]   Uh, you could do the same thing you can get a check of course pay pal if you want it right away
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.240]   My suggestion if you do buy stuff on amazon this would be a great way
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:44.400]   To do it get an amazon gift card. They add five percent to the value automatically their data experts
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.040]   Will take a look at your device check the quality, you know, this how how good a shape it's in and all that in fact
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.320]   Sometimes they even bump the offer up if it's in better shape than you thought it was
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.640]   They'll also wipe your data if you forget to do that
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:00.160]   Uh, I'll tell you this is a gazelle has sent out a hundred a million dollars to over
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.240]   700,000 customers over the last few years you should get in on this
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:10.880]   It is a gold rush gazelle.com. Thank you for their support of mac break weekly and this is a good
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.880]   This is one thing you can do
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.840]   I didn't mean to tie it into that story, but this is one thing you can do
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:21.360]   Is make sure that you know that old device at least gets, you know purchased and lasts a little bit longer
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   so
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:31.840]   I you know, I don't use iWork to the point where I'm really upset with it, but I guess if you did
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:39.840]   You would be upset john lewy gazelle running in his monday note, which I love I read this every monday
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:44.720]   He's a former apple international president right or senior vice president
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   He said apples iWork is another missed opportunity to set expectations. It's more than just iWork
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:00.880]   He talks about uh selling his old chevy tahoe and how impressed he was with his daughter
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.760]   Who went to the dealer the used car dealer and told him all the bad stuff first
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:12.160]   She says the car has a dense in the rear fender love compartment doors a little stubborn cup holders missing a flange
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.440]   However, look at the impeccable engine the spotless interior the good is new finish
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.600]   the dealer was charmed
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:27.280]   And complementary he says this is the opposite of the usual posturing he gets he says the typical seller tote touts the low mileage
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.680]   the documented maintenance
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:34.640]   And then tries to hide the old tires and the nicked rims and the white smoke that comes out of the tailpipe
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.960]   The salesman said this is how you do it. Give the bad news first don't let the buyer discover it
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.240]   Put you on the defensive. He says this guy should talk to apples executives. They've done it again
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:52.160]   They bragged about their refurbished iWork suite only to let customers discover the actual product fails to meet expectations fair
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.720]   Renee
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.160]   Um, sorry. I'm like the reserve for pickup just went live so i was
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:07.600]   Going to a Montreal apprylster and get it. Yes now between three and four o'clock and four and five o'clock
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.600]   So i'll go right after the show awesome
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.680]   Um, awesome. No, I mean it is fair and unfair at the same time
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.800]   It depends on whose point of view it is short-term unfair long-term
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:22.960]   Beneficial apple has this apple is not afraid of hurting short-term interests to serve long-term interests
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:30.000]   He understands that he and we've talked about this before was a complete rewrite from ground ups just as final cut was just as iMovie was
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And features are taken out, but he says apples executive should not take the stage as eddy q does
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.480]   And say quote this is the biggest day for apps in apples history these news versions deliver seamless experience
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.320]   You can't find anywhere else and are packed with great features. You shouldn't say that you should say look
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.120]   We had to take some stuff out
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:54.080]   I understand that absolutely agree with that. I mean they they didn't do that with maps much to their
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.480]   I mean that they're still hurting because they didn't do that with maps
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.840]   They didn't set expectations at all with syria. They were a little bit better because they put the beta tag on that you're right
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:05.200]   Yeah, not nowhere nearly enough. I mean they should have really explained
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:10.640]   This apple has this people attribute to apple this ability to underpromise and over deliver
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:16.080]   So when they do the exact opposite of that it is even more apparent more egregious and more frustrating
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.920]   For users and yeah, I think that's absolutely accurate if they've gone out there and said look
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.200]   We're rewriting. Uh, I work from the ground up. We're making it compatible across these devices
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.280]   But because we've been so busy doing that all the features you know in love aren't there yet
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.720]   But we're gonna work really hard to give them back to you as soon as possible
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.480]   I think a lot of people would understand that would extend them, you know a lot more
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.240]   Time and goodwill than they get otherwise. That's exactly what gasei says
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.920]   He says why brag?
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.600]   Instead of calmly making a case as you just did very well by the way rene
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.800]   For the long game and telling loyal customers about the dense
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:56.240]   Then inevitably discover he also makes another good point which is that you've got this microsoft office 365 which is working beautifully
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.160]   And um, that's you know, that's a challenge for apple now
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.480]   Microsoft's kind of
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.080]   Giving apple some breathing room by not making office available on the ipad
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.960]   Could be a bad strategy on microsoft's part
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.400]   Steve an awful fix that maybe yeah, man. I see Stephen will just sell it all off
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   I I I do think they missed an opportunity here
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:24.560]   I don't I don't blame them for when they're on the big stage with 600 members of the media out there to accentuate the positive
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.160]   and the
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:32.720]   They they stated the overall goal of building a version of iWork that is seamless across all devices including the web
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.360]   Um, but however after the after the lights are down after people have filed out
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.400]   Uh, they are still going to be talking to lots and lots of different people
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   So that's an opportunity for senior executive to say here is our larger as we're saying
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.040]   Here is our larger long-term strategy and here are things that we are giving up in the short run
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.000]   That we're going to we believe that we're going to catch up in the future
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.160]   The thing is though that you do have to the presentation is so important
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.080]   Um, the first time that I I didn't use keynote
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:06.480]   And for like three four days after the new version was available and in that time I was I was reading tech notes
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.520]   I was reading discussions
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.920]   I was talking to other people who had used it and I was prepared for a really really crappy experience
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.560]   And I was quite surprised to find that it was actually quite capable
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.920]   If there's very little
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.280]   That I do with keynote that I couldn't actually make this this app work
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.400]   So if I had seen this is their big
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.200]   You know, this is their big media event
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.440]   They're taking four minutes out of this to tell me how crappy this new app was yeah, maybe
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.120]   I'm not sure I'm not sure if I would have
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.480]   Upgraded to it. I'm not sure if I would have even risked it
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.560]   And I think that once I started using it
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:43.280]   I would not have been open to the possibility that perhaps a unified window is actually very very clean and and attractive interface
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.120]   I would have been focused on oh, yeah
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:49.280]   But if I do a magic move that involves more than eight quick time objects on the same panel
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.440]   Look at how slow that tracks in you know, the old version worked so much better than this
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:59.120]   Oh, it's worse stuff than that though. You I know I know I know that's the problem is basic functionality also
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.480]   Doesn't work. Well, they could pick it out
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.360]   I mean they could have announced collaboration and not done all the rest and then people at least they wouldn't have been promised something
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.200]   That wasn't deliberate because collaboration was good enough on its own to be a nice demo for them
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.480]   Yeah, and it might have been interesting if they simply had if they had
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:20.720]   Created two separate apps so to speak where they have kept the old codebase as a still a set of $15 per download
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.680]   I work apps
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.280]   But then if you want to free apps you download these brand new versions
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.720]   They are not on the same upgrade path as you're old as your old apps
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:33.760]   That would have made really made it a distinction between these two classes of apps
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:39.280]   Where people still expect the same features and the same functionality out of the stuff that they paid $15 a head for
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.560]   But the stuff that they were getting for free they could at least have that lowered expectation that this is a new start
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.000]   This is a new beginning
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.600]   I'm going to get whatever I get from it
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.480]   And then ideally a year and a half from now when those free apps had all the same functionality
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.640]   Of the of the paid apps then you suddenly find people not wanting to buy the new versions and would have been a seamless transition
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.840]   Yeah
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.000]   I mean the same thing happened exactly with iMovie same thing happened exactly with final cut
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.800]   Um now to apples credit. We'll have it and maybe the other go ahead
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.880]   I was saying the other problem is that we do we are looking at
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:19.760]   A consistent trend that is for me very very hard to deny that apple really is scaling down
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.360]   Scaling down their expectations of what their software and what their hardware can do
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.520]   They're still they their the hardware is top notch
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:34.400]   The performance of the operating system and the cp is a drive them are also top notch
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:42.320]   But they're using that those that that speed and that agility to make things simpler and easier and more approachable
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:47.840]   They're not doing it to give you a handheld device that can do a myriad of wonderful things
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:53.680]   You I think that I think that they've sort of lowered the ceiling for Mac OS and they've sort of lowered the ceiling for iOS
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:51:01.920]   Uh, so that if you can comfortably operate within that lowered ceiling all you notice is that things are faster things are slicker things work
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.840]   It worked between
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.880]   Experiences more easily, but once you get to the point where look I've got this project then man
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.520]   I don't know why I have to split this document into several separate projects instead of
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.880]   Instead of keeping it as one big 300 page report
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:20.720]   Uh because the old versions when I was using this same app two years ago
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.640]   I could do that but now the new version doesn't let me do that
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:28.720]   That's when you're gonna start losing people to windows. That's when he's gonna start losing people to android
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.200]   It disappoints me that it's no longer
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.360]   the
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.440]   One of the best aspirational slogans that apple ever had was the power to be your best
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   That's not something that's really applicable anymore
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.600]   That that's that and that's not a that that's not a censure of apple
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   It just means that they are no longer trying to they're no longer promising you that
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.720]   These are wheels for the mind no matter what you want to do with this device
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.560]   We will support you and help you do that
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:00.080]   Right now it's we are going to make sure that you have the least amount of stress and getting the things done that you expect to get done that you can
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   Possibly have this different goal
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.000]   I don't think how they I don't know how they could articulate that without
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.200]   Making people think that hi we're making stupid fisher price, you know leapfrog style
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.600]   Tablets and computers, which is absolutely not what they're doing
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.600]   But it's hard to say that it's hard to make that careful message that we are helping people
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.800]   Get more access to a wider range of features with less trouble and more reliability
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:29.680]   Without making people think that and and yet if you want to get to the top five or the top 10 of the potential
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.320]   Of a computer with this with these specs
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:39.040]   We're gonna find it can increasingly harder as you get from 91 percent to 93 percent to 95 percent to 96 percent
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.480]   Well to uh apple's credit. I guess or maybe they're just starting to feel the heat
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.720]   They did it put up a page in the last couple of days. It talks about
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.680]   Uh, what's missing?
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.440]   And they said some features in the upcoming releases in the next six months
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:03.200]   Customize toolbar vertical ruler improved alignment guides improved object placement improved importment of cells with images improve word counts
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.840]   How can you mess up word count?
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.840]   We miss a few right now we counted a and and we couldn't have we're sorry
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:18.960]   You know, that's one of the first things you write when you're learning how to program is is word count
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:24.720]   Keyboard shortcuts for styles manage pages and sections from the thumb anyway, I can go on and on it's a long list
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.000]   but I
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.520]   And then and then their answer to this is you can continue to use these features by accessing the previous versions of iWork
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:36.880]   They do point out those are still installed. Yeah, so they didn't take they didn't get rid of them
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.000]   um
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.280]   But john louise gessays list of things that are wrong is a little bit more than just a few missing features
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:51.600]   It's it's pretty pretty scathing frankly. Well, well again. I think I think it was a very deliberate move
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:57.840]   Whether saying we're this is a leap that is a leap that we think we need to make and if we have to make things kind of uncomfortable
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.400]   For the next six to eight months. We're gonna do that and they
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:07.120]   Definitely could have made they definitely could have made a better better example of that and look at mavericks all the bugs with mavericks
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.720]   uh, you know, I mean they released a new email
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.200]   Oh, I mean
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.120]   I just
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.120]   Renee has something very very smart to say. I'm sure
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.440]   I'll I'll to get out of the way after just saying that
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:27.280]   I don't think that it's reasonable for us to expect that when you have a major new release as major as iowa 7 was as major as mavericks was
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.000]   That there isn't going to be a transitional period of suck that we're going to have to slog our way through
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:38.720]   Uh, and I think that we have as users we have a greater responsibility to be aware of what's going to happen to our devices when we
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:44.880]   Apply this major major upgrade right in front of me. I have my I have my my my day-to-day use
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:51.120]   Macbook pro that is not on mavericks yet in the other room charging. I have my day-to-day use ipad
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:58.160]   That is not on iowa 7 yet. That's because neither of these things is stable enough to my liking for a device that I rely on
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:03.280]   Day in day off to run my entire business on that doesn't describe everybody but
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:09.920]   Uh, and I know that you know, I I tend to keep my ear to the ground a lot more than consumers do given that apple makes it so easy
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.680]   To simply click this one button and upgrade, but I think that's going to be part of the new
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:21.200]   Responsibility of being a computer or knowing that do not automatically install a major update until you know exactly what this what this is going to entail
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.480]   Seems worse than it has been before, but maybe that's just me
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:29.440]   Or maybe it's what I use. That's more it's the thing that there's this phenomenon
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:34.160]   I experienced here too where you sort of look at the past with rose-colored glasses or forget the pain
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:40.080]   Of that happened in the past, but I have had really really bad experience with upgrades ios 2 ios 3
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.600]   Um, I forget if it was lion or it was snow leopard before that
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:47.280]   I i'm like Andy the machine i'm using right now is still on mountain line
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.480]   I I waited to put it on I don't think six months to even put it on mountain line
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.160]   And i'm gonna wait six months to put it on mavericks because I use it for production work
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:59.440]   But my main macbook is on mavericks already and i'm getting two hours more battery life than I got it before and I made
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:05.680]   An informed adult choice to put it on knowing that there would be some bugs, but wanting the benefits that came with it
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:12.160]   Um, and the way they're going to yearly release cycles and the size the sheer amount of code they're dealing with
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:17.120]   And you know given apples organization, there's gonna be things. I luckily have not had any major problems
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:22.480]   I do have the audio issue which I know how to fix you know through a reboot of all things, but it works
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:28.000]   So it's it's just a matter of you know the pain right now is fresh so it seems really really bad and I hope apple
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.840]   Because it last week
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.000]   Uh, but I do I do write down you know
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.680]   I I go back and look at my old articles about the pain I experienced last year in the year before and i'm quite certain i was just as angry
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.680]   Back then as I am now. Yeah
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:47.920]   All right, oh apple apple says our business does not depend on collecting personal data
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:54.800]   um unlike I don't know some other companies you might you might think of
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.720]   We have no interest in amassing a personal information about our customers
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:04.240]   We protect personal conversations about providing end-to-end encryption over iMessage and FaceTime
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:08.640]   Which they wouldn't harp on that since we know it's still not exactly the case
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:14.400]   We do not store location data map searches or series requests in any identifiable form
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.120]   Now what's interesting is they have now
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.080]   done a transparency report
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:24.960]   And this transparency report which is quite interesting has what some are calling
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:28.240]   a canary
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.320]   in it
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.040]   um, they say we have
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:39.120]   Never been given a what is it the section 203 letter
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.240]   a basically a
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.920]   one of those
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.080]   National security letters. We've never received one
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.080]   so
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.640]   They they say we've never received a warrant
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:56.240]   but by saying we've never received a warrant they call this a warrant canary
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.880]   if that
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:03.200]   Transparency port continues to come out and at some point that sentence is missing
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.160]   It is a legal way
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.400]   I'm saying hey, we got one
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.480]   I like it clever
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:18.320]   Like dark matter clever. It's the absence of the warranty canary that is telling you something
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.920]   I'm but I'm sorry. I think that if if I were if I were a member of the government who had
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:28.320]   Responsibility for this sort of thing. I would be Pio enough about this. All right. Guess what?
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.920]   I'd be like the one guy who has to do the one star review of
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:38.160]   Finding Nemo just because the five star reviews just 100% grunting tomatoes reading screws me over
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.240]   I love it. We're gonna see we're gonna see more of this stuff
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:48.640]   I I have not I've not taught to anybody at google facebook or not not really spoken to anybody at apple about this
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.960]   But at high levels who is not?
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.840]   Absolutely ticked off about what they what they're being
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:57.920]   Expected to do and not finding countermeasures to do almost exactly what apple is saying
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.560]   So they know exactly what they're legally required to do
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.880]   But they also know that if like if we can say well, we have no data to turn over and yes
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.720]   You asked us to collect this data
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:11.600]   However, you did not file your request and such if it's they're looking for ways to be able to say look
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   We aren't unless unless you've been caught with plutonium
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.040]   In your jockey shorts during a tsa patdown
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:24.080]   There's we're gonna find a way not to hand over your information to somebody who does not have her access to it
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:30.640]   Here's the line. It's the last line in the apple report apple has never received an order under section 215 of the patriot act
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:34.800]   We would expect to challenge such an order of served on us
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.280]   but
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.280]   as some many have pointed out
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:43.120]   Uh other companies did this in fact our sync is the first company to have done it
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:45.120]   Look out security has also done it
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:51.040]   The point being that if you ever saw that line disappeared then you could presume they have received a section 215 order
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.600]   Not that that's such a big revelation. I mean
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:59.840]   The fact that google and facebook have not made this statement probably is a strong an indication that they have received an order
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:05.200]   But so what it's sad that it comes to this. I mean, it's one of those
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.400]   Pesthetic
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.320]   It's one of my favorite lines from you know again
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.480]   I'm gonna quote the west wing and a country found that on freedom what could be more important than privacy
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:18.000]   And that was in 1999 and now, you know, it's absolutely become an out of fess that we just yeah
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.040]   Beyond the pawing
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:27.360]   Um, I think we can take a break and come up with our picks of the week unless you guys have a story that we haven't covered
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.880]   You really would like to talk about i'm gonna leave all the lawsuits out
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.520]   I find them boring and unproductive
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.160]   Well, if we want to be if we want to be like live cable news
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:44.240]   We can say that there i'm getting multiple messages from people claiming that
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.320]   the uh, the
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:50.800]   CPU performance of the ipad mini is closer to the five s than the ipad air that there is a
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.480]   measurable distance however
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.040]   I've been trying to find the actual tests that people are performing and i'm not seeing them yet
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:02.160]   The iPhone is 1.3 and the air is 1.4. So that would mean the mini is 1.3
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.440]   I won't notice that difference in every day and also we're talking we're talking about how fast
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:13.760]   How many how many CPU cycles happen between cursor flashes while it's waiting for you to type the next thing with the keyboard
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.800]   Yeah, I don't know if you notice usually talking about what they're talking about. So right?
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.560]   I don't know if you notice this is coming from mac rumors, which has apparently
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.840]   acquired a mini and run benchmarks
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.280]   um
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.720]   And they say that it doesn't this is I suspect what I fix it was talking about it's probably not running
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.200]   At the same clock speed. Yeah
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.640]   It's a normal issue. Right. Yeah, it's it's more important that's running the a7
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.840]   If it we're running a lesser processor at the same speed as this a7 that wouldn't be as good as having a slower
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.680]   An underclock a7 or a suit or a slower a7. It's not a huge difference according to geekbench 3 the retina
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:56.480]   Is running at 1.3 gigahertz, which is what the i-phone 5s runs at the air is 1.4 gigahertz
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.800]   Not a big difference. Yeah, it's not a human discernible difference probably not
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.840]   Uh, why would they do that better battery life?
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.120]   He he yeah
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.560]   Well, yes
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.760]   Yeah, this is this is this is the nature of this device on on
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.440]   There are problems that I will notice on a smaller version of the same tablet on an android that I will not notice
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.680]   Particularly on the larger one simply by the verse the fact that my hands are covering the entire thing
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.160]   Uh, and so it's a literally there is there is no place for a for a heat bloom to hide
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.680]   Right, and also there's presumably less opportunities less opportunities to radiate heat out elsewhere
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.480]   Given how tightly packed things are going to have to be in a smaller tablet. So that's what that's what they call it a heat bloom
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:44.240]   Uh, I'm saying heat bloom because I like that. I hope you've coined that in trademarked it
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:50.000]   It's it's I think it's I think it's a I think it's from uh aerial reconnaissance when they're looking right?
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.320]   No, seriously when they were looking at infrared
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.760]   Photography and video of all there's a heat bloom from that shed over there so therefore there are people who are in operation in there
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.760]   but
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.080]   Yes, I'm thinking of Orlando bloom. All right. The guy is
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.240]   He's gorgeous
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.920]   Let's take a break when we come back our picks of the weekendy and I come from the chicago sun times rene richy
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.480]   I'm more.com rene. Did you get that pickup set up?

[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.000]   All right. You want us to watch that live or should we take a break while you focus?
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.560]   No, no, go ahead
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.880]   If we had a picture of his screen, we would display it but we don't so
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.040]   Chad can we go right now and pick one up
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.640]   Really
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.800]   That's 128 gigger
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.480]   Should I send somebody down to get one? Well, the question is is one version did you get?
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.440]   Did you get the wi-fi cellular because wi-fi 32 and then on which carrier?
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.680]   Uh, no wi-fi 30
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.480]   Yeah, no those are available today. Well
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.200]   Yeah, we could just send someone down and pick you up one. Should I cancel my order?
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:08.240]   Uh, I can reserve this right now and then yeah, and then I'd say wait a minute. No, let's get a 64
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.720]   I only did that because I had okay. Okay. Well, you could get the hundred and no, I don't want 128
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.280]   That's just that's just great. Definitely wi-fi only. Yeah, nine four nine five two
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.400]   Someone is trying to tell somebody how to diffuse a bomb via telephone
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.720]   It's available. It's available. All right. So let the store
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.680]   Should I give you my Lisa? What should we do? I already ordered a 32. I guess I could cancel the 32
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.760]   Yeah, see if you can still cancel it you'll take the 32 for Christmas present skipping
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.080]   No, no engraving because that of course would slow it down
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.280]   Uh, I would like the smart case
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.840]   Am I a sucker to buy that or no
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.920]   In blue probably okay. Yeah, we have to sense that we'll get an appointment in a moment
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.640]   Just like uh, just like Renee
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.840]   Although he's will be in Montreal. That would be the big difference. He'll be in french
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.000]   Which color smart case would you like?
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.040]   Uh, can I have product red? Yes, I'm not
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.640]   I like to do my bet and besides reds a cute color. Oh, thanks. You okay? Uh, thanks me
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:08.400]   He's on call his money into palms. So he needs the money. I say select store select store Santa Rosa
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.520]   Yeah, yeah add to cart. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now you probably need a credit card. What?
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.560]   $668
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.560]   Because we can get it today
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.120]   If we can get it today, we can do it before we buy it. Well, go ahead
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.000]   Uh, some reason it seems like it's it's it's still says
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.480]   Shipping pick up. Oh, you have to continue right. Okay, uh, Renee if you continue on
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.920]   Now we you should probably hide that screen as you and I don't my apple has yeah, you maybe you should do this
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.640]   Do you want me to take the ad? Lisa can do it
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:43.360]   That's the point is it well go through it and I think that at the end of the order process you could say pick up
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.840]   Right
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.920]   I don't know who can drive
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:52.960]   Uh, no, you can have somebody pick it up for you
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.440]   I thought it's there when you get her I thought you could actually actually drive her places that said her information
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.720]   No
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:04.000]   It says have somebody pick it up for you. I don't care. Well, you know what? Let's finish the ad. Let's finish the show
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.400]   I'll go do it
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.920]   I got an hour
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   I showed it a body
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.200]   But you but you can't do that leo
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:18.560]   You can't buy one today. I really think if we should get we if we can we should pick it up
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.120]   Do it leo go for it. Do you way you're getting yours, Renee, right? Yep
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.320]   the Montreal apple store
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:31.280]   The fair view point clear, uh, Canada like we had two football teams named the rough riders
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.000]   We have two stores named fair view. It's very confusing
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.440]   I do have an apple business account. We should use that don't yeah, and then you get a
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:43.760]   Percent off or something silly 2% or 3% some ridiculously low
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.800]   Are you sure? Yes. Are you sure today brought to you? Let me tell you something

[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:22.400]   I've reserved for pickup and what time four or five between two and four whoa
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.360]   That means you can get there at 201 right
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.360]   Well, it's eastern times. Oh, they text you though though. Don't they they'll text you
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:35.600]   It's already three three days the day it launched in Canada. We've never had pickups for reserve for pickup before so
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.160]   I think they send you a text and say you're you're mini with retinas waiting
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.800]   You have 33 seconds to get in here theoretically I have 30 more minutes to get there theoretically
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.560]   Well quick give us your pick and then we'll get out of here
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:51.040]   So my pick is incredibly self-serving this week, but we just relaunched the iMore app
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:57.200]   So this is the iMore app version 3.0 like iWork we rebuilt it from the ground up like iWork
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.840]   We no longer have all the features we used to have but we have a lot of really cool new one
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:06.000]   So it's an iOS 7 app uses all the iOS 7 frameworks. It's got the
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.800]   the swipe to go to the sidebar
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.360]   it's got the
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.440]   The navigation between stories
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:20.960]   It's got integration with reading lists. You can do commenting with iOS 7 style avatars right in the app
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.280]   So if I want to leave a comment on here, I can
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:29.040]   I can just go into any i'll show you up here so you can actually see it if I want to go into the story I can just
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.000]   It's in reverse. I apologize. I can swipe between the main stories here
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.760]   other way
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.200]   There we go
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.520]   So I can swipe into the stories. I can go into a story
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.960]   I can
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.800]   Leave a comment on the story and see everyone else who's commented on the story
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:51.920]   And I can even swipe in between stories if I really want to and I can and I have the I had the iHand coordination to do it
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:58.000]   But it's in the app store now. It is still free. It's got all of our articles all of our podcasts
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.000]   Everything that we can do we're still working on it. We'll have an iPad version soon, but it just launched in the app store yesterday
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.120]   Um, and we're really really happy with it. So please check it out
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.000]   awesome
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.440]   Very nice
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.280]   Andy and not go
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.480]   You're picking the week
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:23.360]   I got a lot of when I posted that photo of my mobile mobile's news broad broad podcasting video casting studio 2 000 dopplers setup
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.680]   From that airport lounge when I was podcasting from last week
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.560]   A lot of people asked me like about this light that I was using to like have mobile illumination
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.520]   So I thought I'd make that my pick of the week. This is the micro pro
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:41.120]   Uh from like panels. It is a really super super good light
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:49.040]   Uh, it's all led it will run off of a variety of ac voltages, but it will also run
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.920]   Dam near forever on a set of six double a batteries. Uh, so it is
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.080]   It also has a couple of nice little attachments to it. It comes with this little stand
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:03.680]   So that you can either put it right inside the hot shoe of your slr or camera so you can use it
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.920]   Like as if just as a video life your camera
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:10.480]   Uh, or it also has a tripod mount, which is what I was using last week
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.360]   So I just put it on like a little tabletop stand or floor stand
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.880]   And as you can kind of see it really puts off
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.040]   A good amount of light with fresh batteries. I mean this is actually quite painful to look into so i'm not going to look into that
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.240]   Uh, but it's also adjustable with this knob here
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.160]   So you can you can hit exactly the amount of light that you want
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:34.560]   So this is a smaller version of the professional like led light panels that you see
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.640]   Uh, a lot of studios using
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.880]   Uh, and it's also uh, there's another reason why I have this picture behind me because
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.600]   This is like one of the superstar utility players in my in my gadget bag
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.600]   Uh, because uh, this is not I'm really happy with it
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:54.400]   I knew that I was going to be getting a chance to see this the the space shuttle while I was in LA last week
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.040]   I definitely wanted to get a picture of the cows in front of it
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.560]   Uh, and I as I often do I post this in my bag
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.120]   Because this gave me put right in front of the cows like this
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.960]   Gave me the exact right amount of fill lighting that I needed to separate the cows from the background
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.600]   So whenever i'm traveling sometimes i'll have a briefing where i'm not going to be sent home with hardware
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.040]   But i'm allowed to play with the hardware and photograph the hardware
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.800]   This always goes inside my bag because it is much easier
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.000]   I get the shot much more quickly and i'm much better shot
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.160]   If I have if i'm using this as opposed to a flash because I can simply aim it exactly where I want that light to go
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.760]   Uh, and then I can also say oh no, that's too bright. I want that a little bit
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.600]   All I want to do is I want to highlight the edge of that so it separates from the table a little bit
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.640]   And so I can get great great pictures just using this as a little diy
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.160]   Uh, illuminator. It's not cheap. It's like a $300 light
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.080]   But if you need mobile light whether you're shooting video or whether you're doing
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.600]   Photography where you need that sort of little humble little fill light
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.320]   You will find that this is a solution to so many problems. It really does run its way. I love it
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.440]   Yeah
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.240]   And look at this shot. I mean it really makes a difference because you get that fill
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.480]   Yeah, I mean I could point to you you look at the shots I took of the uh, uh of the uh,
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.000]   Kindle fire HDX where again, I don't it's not like they're setting up a studio for me in that office
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.760]   It's just like on a coffee table
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.080]   And if I spend more than a few minutes taking pictures is probably not going to be very polite
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.480]   But that's I get so many not
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:31.040]   I has to say studio quality but much much better than what you would get with just trying to take a picture with
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.640]   On-camera flash or whatever time you have and also I should mention that
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.000]   I'm not I'm not sure if you necessarily carry this with you while you're traveling as a way if
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:45.280]   As an illuminator for your cell phone, but that is actually shot with a cell phone
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.840]   And you would never ever ever ever be able to get like flash sync to work
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.760]   On a on a phone like that
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.720]   But if this is just it's just on all the time and always giving you light
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:01.280]   And so that always that gives you a way to create the kind of picture where people will be surprised to learn that it was actually taken with a cell phone
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.320]   I did a uh, uh, I'm sorry last note because I I'm very pleased with this with the sketch
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.440]   Uh, I also took a picture of the underside you're walking around and you've got your camera
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.240]   And you're sort of looking for interesting photos and I noticed that
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.680]   Uh, the the the wing flaps in the back of the space shuttle like there's like a gap between them that you can see
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.200]   The parts of the american flag that's hanging on the back of the hanger
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.040]   So I really want to get a shot of the underside
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.960]   You can see the the heat resistant tiles and just enough of the flag and wasn't coming out
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.560]   Well because it was just a cell phone camera and I realized oh wait
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.840]   I've got this powerful illuminator too. So I was actually holding this illuminator like this up
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.920]   So it was actually illuminating those black tiles while I was getting the regular
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.600]   Exposure from the flag in the bag. So as I said, it's it's it's a great thing to have in your bag where
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.800]   You will at one point you'll be at a point where in a lot of different places where you'll you'll realize that
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:56.480]   Oh, well, I guess I guess I have no solution to that problem. Then you realize it wait a minute
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.520]   I've got ultra bright steady LED light that's adjustable in my bag
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:02.960]   I have a solution to this problem that it's saved my neck so many times
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.720]   We love light panels. They were our original lighting provider. We have lots of light panels in our studio
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.960]   And I have a few of those
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.360]   As well really good stuff and they last forever. I mean they're really yeah
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:20.080]   I mean I was it's like I I did not put fresh batteries in here before I left
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.920]   And I was like oh, I bet the batteries are dead, but nope
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.080]   I can't remember the last time I changed the batteries and you have still again point of pain
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.760]   brightness
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.760]   I was going to demonstrate the knock app because it's been getting a lot of attention
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.040]   Except that unfortunately there's a little flaw in the setup
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.480]   Sarah now has to knock to turn on my uh
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:46.560]   So the knock app is kind of a very it's a really cool idea
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.480]   um
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.280]   You put the app which is four dollars on your iphone
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:57.920]   And you put the desktop app on your late model by the way has to be a late model macintosh
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:03.600]   And then what happens uh, and I just rebooted so maybe I can get it to work now because what it is
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:10.320]   It uses the uh low energy bluetooth. So that's why it has to be a late model mac and has to support bluetooth le
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.200]   um
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:20.320]   To unlock your macintosh by you get within a range of your mac locked mac and you knock
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.280]   On your phone twice
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.360]   And the mac goes hello
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.600]   Unfortunately
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.560]   It doesn't have a way to say which bluetooth
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:36.800]   Lowy device low energy device and for some reason um, it's unlocking itself
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.000]   By attaching to you sarah
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   So I uh, I I'm gonna try to set it up again
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.960]   It says lock your phone will take care of setup on your mac. Okay. My phone is locked. Okay
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.080]   They have some work to do. It's a great idea
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:00.000]   I got it working at home. So when I get home, I have to have the iphone within bluetooth range of my mac in the night
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.320]   Knock it at twice and it wakes up. Um, but unfortunately
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:10.800]   For some reason it didn't see the iphone sitting right next to it running the knock app apparently sarah has it on her iphone
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:17.120]   And uh, so it's now associated so now sarah can basically unlock my uh, my mac anytime she wants by knocking
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:21.840]   It's enough to make me want apple to do it. Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to stop recommending this
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.240]   application
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:28.320]   Worked great when I tried it at home, but setting it up here today. It was kind of a less of a
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.200]   So we're seeing the opposite of the cold bear bump. It's the
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.480]   report
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:39.520]   So you by the way, if you're looking for it on the app store, it's kind of hard to find because there's lots of other apps with the word
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.000]   Knock it's knock unlock your mac there it is
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.800]   Without typing a thing your phone is the password. That's the name of the program
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:52.640]   by knock software incorporated and then do the same thing on uh searching for the uh,
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.480]   Website because you need to download the app from a website for that
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:04.080]   Um, just knock software incorporated will do it because if you just search for knock an app you'll get all the articles about the knock app
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.440]   Yep
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.440]   Not to knock the knock app
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.680]   Why have I not been approached as a spokesperson for this?
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.560]   In naco
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.840]   In naco
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.800]   In knock
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.320]   That's what they should have called it in not co then you could have found it any naco
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.480]   You could find him at the chicago sun times
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.520]   That's where he right what are you working on today for the times?
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:29.280]   Uh wrapping up my review of the ipad air which I took for its first field excursion last week
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.560]   Uh and after that a lot a more longer think piece about the nature of the ipad which is
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:41.760]   Yeah, I could say we can see some of that coming out of you today exciting time. I'd like to yeah
