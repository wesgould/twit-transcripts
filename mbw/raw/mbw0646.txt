[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.400]   People like Renee Richie from imore.com. Hello Renee.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.520]   Hey Leo, I didn't answer this, but you're still seeing my mic and my video, so I'm very concerned.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.200]   Oh, is that a problem?
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920]   I guess we'll get to that. Yeah.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.760]   Okay. Oh, oh, we're talking about FaceTime. Yeah, I've been listening in Renee. Shame on you. Shame on you. We'll get to that.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.920]   I love Roger Whitaker and I will not apologize.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.160]   There's a ship lies safe and ready in the. Andy and I co is also here from WGBH,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.640]   Pasta Public Radio. Great to see you Andrew.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.440]   Great to see you. It sounds like Renee has things to hide.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.880]   I mean, that's I've got I have no problem being surveilled by every device that I have.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.400]   That's why I chose Andrew to begin with.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.120]   I have a collection, sir.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.040]   And it's.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.720]   Sorry.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.400]   And I was going to pick something's fine. Go ahead.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.280]   And I well, we can't leave Lori Gill out the wonderful Lori Gill managing editor of I'm more
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.000]   is here as well, filling in for Alex Lindsey and frankly, Alex can never come back again.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.440]   We've replaced you Alex.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.960]   Lori has got the hair. That's true.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.520]   You might be listening in on our FaceTime calls right now and hearing you say that.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.080]   Oh, so let's talk about that because that was that was obviously the story of the day.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.640]   Somebody tweeted. I think it was yesterday.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.240]   Oh, look, when you use Apple's FaceTime group calling feature, if you add yourself to the group,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.760]   call somebody answered the call because anybody group can answer the call.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.600]   You can listen in and to the person on the other end.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.000]   And in fact, you can even do it in video.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.520]   Yeah, I mean, that's kind of a good deal.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.480]   Actually, I think there is another tweet that popped up on the tweet feeds.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.960]   MGT7 nine days ago actually tweeted this a similar thing.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.320]   I don't think it was as as well described, but it says,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.560]   my team found a major security fall in Apple's new iOS.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.000]   He can listen into your iPhone or iPad without your approval.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.760]   I have video submitted a bug report to Apple support waiting to hear back to provide
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.360]   details, scary stuff.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.000]   So that's the big question because the person who tweeted it didn't follow what is normally done
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.760]   in security circles, which is this responsible notification where you tell the company,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.040]   you give them 90 days to fix it, then you make it public if they don't.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.920]   It's like a zero day. They just went out and told them.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah, no human knows that though. That's the problem.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.200]   And that's the real and that's why I pointed out immediately is they not secure.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.040]   Whoever found this wasn't a security researcher.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.720]   So they just said, look what I can do.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.440]   95, Mac verified it and Apple responded to their credit very quickly.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.120]   They disabled group FaceTime.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.720]   Actually, they disabled all FaceTime, right?
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.760]   They cut it.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.320]   Well, they cut it.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.920]   So they cut it.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.880]   Initially, they just said that we're going to fix this within a few days.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.800]   And people get concerned like, why not immediately?
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.600]   Because you always want to test the fix because if it's a bad fix,
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.360]   it could be worse than no fix at all.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.840]   So it takes them a couple of days to QA it and then they release it.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.360]   But that this was bug was so bad.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.400]   They actually went in and shut down the FaceTime group server,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.280]   which is a separate server from the original FaceTime server.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.520]   So you can still FaceTime one on one, but you can't connect more than one person anymore,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.440]   which means you can't use this bug anymore.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.240]   It's funny. This MGT-7500 said he reported the news to Fox News.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.640]   It's a weird there are people looking into this because the account like just arrived
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.840]   and had some weird tweets and then it tweeted this.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.120]   And then there's like when you look at the email, they claim that Apple sent.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.200]   It's broken with no sort of hyphenation.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.280]   So it could be that it got lost because Apple used to only hit the Wall Street Journal.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.880]   That would get Apple to reply.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.080]   Now Apple replies when it hits 9-5 Mac, which is great.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.600]   But it's still if you're just on a social network somewhere and you're one of hundreds
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.480]   of millions of people tweeting at Apple's support, there's still no good way to sort of
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.800]   filter out and find the really important stuff and get that to Apple's Red Teams.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.840]   Because you could tell the minute this hit 9-5 Mac,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.200]   everything had Apple stopped. But nothing happened when that original tweet went out.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.160]   Nobody saw it.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.680]   Yeah, and it was January 20th, isn't that long ago?
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.360]   That's not the day it was discovered.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   That's the first time that somebody who was aware of this
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.520]   decided to post it to a public forum.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.520]   Every time you see it, that's a good point.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.880]   You figure that it's been in the field for a long, long time.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.920]   And there are a lot of people.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.120]   It's like the Coke machine that's giving you two cokes.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.960]   Every time you put in one dollar, nobody's telling nobody to fix that thing.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.760]   The people who want their free codes.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.200]   The good news is, as we've already said, but I'll say it one more time, Apple's going to fix
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.520]   this post-taste probably this week.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.280]   Until then, they've disabled the feature that allowed it.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.880]   It's not something anybody could worry about today.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.960]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.240]   That's important to point out.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.520]   People were going a little bit scared yesterday and turning off FaceTime
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.720]   or putting on Do Not Disturb mode and potentially missing other calls
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.160]   or trying to hang up really quickly.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.240]   It's terrible.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.760]   You can be super angry about it.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.960]   It took a while also when Apple shut off the servers.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.000]   It took a while for it to propagate so that all the servers were shut down.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.280]   But as of right now, I haven't seen any more reports of anyone successfully doing a group
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.240]   FaceTime call.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.800]   So at least that part of it you don't have to worry about now.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.920]   I urge greater caution.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.360]   That's just my personal thing.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.160]   Apple says that they're going to have a bug fix in a few days.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.440]   So if you can do without FaceTime, I think it's a good idea to turn it off only because
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.480]   you know that as soon as this thing went wide,
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.120]   everybody who wasn't aware of it is now really pounding on FaceTime
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.280]   to look for any other exploits they can do based on this bug.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:39.280]   If I can deal with FaceTime for a few days,
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   I would not assume that any gun is unloaded.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.080]   And I would do without it for a few days because again, I'm going to go ahead.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.280]   So when did this rename, when did it become active?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.880]   One quick thing I wanted to add is that if you depend on sign language or you traveling and
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.560]   you want to see your bit like there are use cases that you might want like in general,
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.080]   yeah, if you don't need to turn it off, but if you do depend on sign language or you need to
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.360]   see something or you need to do something, the threat level of this is considerably smaller than
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.160]   it was last night.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.560]   Right. Again, I agree with me. If you need FaceTime, use it.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.880]   If you don't need it, again, my advice is to turn it off for a few days.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.040]   That's not as bad as it might have been like last week, which is almost for God's sakes
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.560]   until Apple responds to this. Do not put your phone in your sock drawer and leave it on.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.680]   When did this become possible? Only when they turned on group FaceTime,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.880]   which was not so long ago.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.720]   And we don't know because like to Andy's point, we don't know when.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.000]   Like this, Laurie mentioned in earlier discovery, there might have been early discoveries we'll
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.840]   find on some Facebook page one day. And there could be people who found it and never reported
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.960]   it. So we won't know exactly when it went live. It had to have been sometime after 12.1
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.320]   shipped because that's when FaceTime groups went live for everybody. We don't know if it was in
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.680]   that original version. We might have to have someone and you can't even test it now because
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.400]   if you have the old version, but it was sometime after December, I think, November, December.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.240]   How does something like this get through? I mean, is this a difficult bug to discover?
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.120]   No, it's just, you know, again, when you have software at this scale,
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.160]   it's stupid and somebody should have found it in testing. And maybe it didn't exist in the
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.160]   early versions when they tested it and they made a bug fix to something else. And the latest update
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.480]   that went out a week ago or something included it is just the complexity level of the stuff
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.400]   increases. There's no such thing as perfect code. There's always mistakes that happen in it.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.280]   And sometimes also, you know, Apple does beta test this stuff and nobody found it in the beta
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.200]   tests either or at least nobody disclosed it when they found it in the beta test either.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.360]   So the public had access to this as well. It's just something that's stupid flyingly like open
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.760]   SSL and a bunch of other stuff that you just you can't believe. Always surprising. You know,
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.280]   every everything has bugs. There's no perfect software ever. Hope King had a great line
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.000]   yet last night where she said there's two kinds of bugs. One's that you found and
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.920]   once you haven't found there's no such thing as private. There's no perfect software.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:14.000]   And running is right. What it's kind of funny to me is we're up in arms about the fact that this
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.280]   privacy thing that, you know, there's this way that somebody can listen in on our conversations
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.840]   for the 10 seconds before we hang up on them after they've called us. And what a big deal is this
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.600]   and how did Apple let this happen and how come they haven't addressed it sooner. But we all allow
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.800]   all these other companies to literally create digital versions of ourselves and we don't have
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.360]   a problem with that. They might as well be listening in on our conversations with as much data as
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.720]   they've gathered about us. Why is it such a big deal that an accident happened that is now being
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.680]   fixed when we're not addressing like this large. Well, you would think it's a big deal if you know
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:11:00.480]   what I heard last night on your phone. It was not over three. It just well, I mean, to to her point
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:10.080]   is it's it's awareness that it's awareness that every device has sensors on it that can be activated
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:16.720]   without your knowledge if a bad operator or a bad piece of software is acting against your best
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:25.520]   interest. This is it is a big deal because Apple and other companies that are creating this infrastructure
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:31.280]   are required, I think morally to make sure that this infrastructure is safe so that when a bug
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.960]   like this does occur, that's a really, really big aggregation of responsibility. The other problem
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.040]   is that this is why I really winced when I saw that huge billboard at CES. What happens on your
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:50.880]   on your iPhones. This is punishment for hubris, isn't it? Yeah, exactly. And I realized that the
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.160]   sign was talking about actual physical data collection by by Google and other companies,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.320]   not about security bugs. But that's you're really are tried to say that, oh, but by the way, we are
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.200]   our security is so good that there is no bug or no exploit that we haven't already found in
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:14.000]   quash, again, it's like, that's why you have to really be sure. That is that is like, that's a
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.280]   God is like saying, say, say Peter, watch this. I also should issue a apology for last week where
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.080]   I was ragging on Apple because they forced you to use Google and search in Safari. And many,
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   many have pointed out to me that you can go into the search settings in Safari and make it be
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.760]   duck go or Bing or Yahoo, if you want, if you don't want to use Google, although my point still stands,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.960]   Google's the default most people will ever change it. But I assume people knew that the default.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.760]   Yeah, I didn't know it. I guess I might have known it in the past. That's the problem. There's
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.240]   so many settings these days and modern devices you forget what's there. So yeah, in fact,
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.800]   people tend to use the default. So I think the point is still if you care, you can.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.560]   It's going to cost Apple a micro cent, but you can turn your turn your default search to
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:11.760]   something else, including duck duck go.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.680]   Last thing I just wanted to back up her name in defensive Apple, the amount of things that you
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:24.480]   are building software on shifting sands, you change one thing and it's to fix a critical bug.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.560]   You really have no idea what other parts of the system have been affected by that bug fix
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.560]   until you then retest everything all over again. It really is like running an Apollo mission,
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:40.880]   shifting, creating even the simplest piece of software. So this probably shouldn't be used as
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.000]   an argument that, oh, see, Apple's lost its magic. See, the sort of thing never used to happen when
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.560]   Steve Jobs was in business. But he had some terrible bugs then too. Again, losing everything
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:59.600]   on your hard drive. That was also a major bug after a system update. I would say that perhaps
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:06.480]   it was also a big bug. It's one more reminder that that's why I don't like Apple fandom,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.160]   just like I don't like Google fandom. I know there is no such thing as Facebook fandom, but
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:18.000]   remember that this is the H.P. Fandy is handy. Hey, I still have my compact
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.880]   percario. It still runs. It runs one's mind sweep. I'm just saying this is why if you're building
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.200]   this idea of your mind that we're using Apple hardware, and again, I'm running on an Apple
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.760]   on Apple right here. I use an iPad every day. I grew up with Apple twos and really as a little kid,
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.360]   kind of as having little kid fantasies about how cool Apple is. This sort of fan worship is
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:49.040]   counterproductive to both Apple and yourself. They are mortals doing a really, really tough job.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:54.880]   And for every crisis that we got bubbles to the surface and becomes a trending topic on Twitter,
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.480]   there are 100 that they catch just in time. And so they are mortals. These things happen.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.880]   The only question is how do they respond to it? And the fact that they responded to 95
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.960]   Mac very quickly and also didn't leave people hanging safe. We are aware of the problem and
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.600]   are investigating the issue. It was very quick say, we got the bug fix. It's going to be deploying
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.680]   by the end of this week. Hopefully love more to say about it. I wonder what people are going
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.560]   to be talking to asking Tim Cook about during the call today. Well, that's my next story.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.160]   Let me move on. I just wanted to add, there's a really good point is how the companies respond.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.480]   But it's also how the companies architect. And if they make sure that the architecture is
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.160]   encrypted, for example, if someone breaks in, all they get is who to random junk, they don't get
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.240]   your data. So there's a lot companies can do to minimize their footprint once they are
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   compromised. And then also it's how they respond once they're compromised.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   This is the day Apple gives its quarterly results. These are the results that Tim already
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.720]   warned people won't be as good as we had hoped. I know Renee, in fact, one of the reasons I'd
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.080]   like everybody to be a little bit shorter in their responses, we want to get Renee out this time.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.960]   It's not you. I'm talking about Renee. We want to get people Renee out in time because he's got
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.280]   work to do. Although, Lori, you do too, right? Are you the transcriptionist this time?
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:15.360]   Oh, God. No. Oh, good. Wonderful, wonderful helper, wonderful friend, Micah Sargent,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.560]   is going to be taking care of the trans-renity. Oh, Micah took over from Serenity. Huh? All right.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.520]   Yeah, yeah. He does a much, much better job than I could even pretend to do.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.800]   So that's usually around, it's after the market closes. So,
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.560]   fresh releases, $4.30 at the conference call is five. Okay. And that's specific time of 3pm.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.040]   We'll try to get out by then. I think we will be. I don't want to worry about it.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:42.400]   You've got actually 2pm Pacific time, right? Yeah, 2pm. Yeah. You got some writing to do.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.800]   All right, we're going to, we'll talk about what to expect. We also have
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   the annual six colors report card on Apple. And of course, next week, we'll be doing the quarterly
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:01.840]   six colors graphs. Thanks to Jason Snell and a tiny screw that shows you why iPhones cannot be
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:07.120]   assembled in the United States. A great story from the New York Times about the trash can Mac
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:14.480]   Pro, but first a word about your securities. As long as we're talking, bugs happen. And this is a
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:21.200]   day and age where some of the bad guys are getting smarter and smarter. So you need to get smarter
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.360]   and smarter and protecting yourself. And there's a name everybody knows, certainly if you ever
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.640]   listen to security now, we talk about sofos all the time. We in fact use sofos gear here
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:37.440]   to protect ourselves at Twitter. It has the best technology, AI technology. They use deep
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.880]   learning. This is how this is how far it's gotten with bad guys. You know, it's always been a seesaw
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.640]   battle. Sofos is now applying the latest state of the art deep learning technology to learn
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.960]   how bad guys work and protect you. And this way they can respond to threats faster than any
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   antivirus can we are fans of so sofos. We use their UTM's we use their software. Sofos recently
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.680]   ranked ranked number one by an independent security test from se labs. The best protection
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.320]   rating across the board for both large enterprises and small business. And now and here's the good
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.120]   news and the reason why you might be interested in this. They took this technology already protecting
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:24.240]   millions of business users and made a premium version available for home users for max as well
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:31.120]   as for PCs. It's called sofos home. And you know, I'm not a fan of antiviruses, but this is different.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.200]   This is real time protection from the latest ransomware attacks malicious software from fishing,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.600]   hacking of all kinds, very easy to use. And it's always up to date. It's always learning and it's
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.480]   always smarter. If you're just securing your own laptop or managing multiple devices in your home,
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:54.720]   or as as with Twitter, many devices all around the world, you can sign up for a single account
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.080]   and protect every Mac and PC in your home from one console. I really like that. And because it's
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.320]   cloud based, you can even use it to keep your relatives secure. I'm putting it on my mom's Mac,
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.160]   even though she's thousands of miles away. So I can remotely manage her security clean up threats,
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:17.280]   keep the systems safe. You may know sofos's tagline is security made simple. And of course,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.720]   that that's true too for sofos home. You log in from your browser and it's easy to use and you
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.520]   start securing your systems today. This is the right way to do it. Whether you're a home user
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.880]   or a large enterprise, sofos has you covered third party reviewers consistently rank sofos
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.520]   among the best cybersecurity providers. And I love the synchronized security, which means you can
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.800]   manage all your products from a single cloud based console, even remote relatives. You want to
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.160]   try it free trial today. And of course, I recommend this many times. They also have a free security
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:20:00.880]   scan sofos S O P H O S dot com next generation protection for your home. Sofos.com. We are fans.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:09.920]   So what do we expect? We already know because Cook issued that guidance a couple of weeks ago
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:19.120]   that it was not going to be the bounty that Apple had thought this quarter. He downgraded it to
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:27.200]   $84 billion revenue instead of as much as 92 to $94 billion. So what do we think?
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:34.400]   Was that a face palm graphic or just a headache? That is a this is a picture of a non-existent
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.880]   thing, which is a guy in a blue jacket on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor. But really,
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.960]   as far as I know, according to Flash Boys, there's nothing going on on the trading floor.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.800]   That's just photo op stuff because it's all done by computers now. He's shading his eyes from the
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:57.680]   brightness of the photographer's flashes. So, you know, we're a show about Mac form
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:04.560]   about in 4 Mac users, but an app and iPhone and iOS users. But I think some of this does,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.720]   you know, give us information about how Apple's doing and where Apple's going, right?
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.600]   It's going to be the second most profitable quarter in the history of Apple. And it's going to be a
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.400]   huge disappointment to everyone inside and outside of Apple. And both these things can be true.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.520]   Because it means it hints at the great fear. We've had the commoditization of desktop computers
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.560]   for a while and now it looks like we've reached the saturation of the smartphone market. And
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.280]   the iPhone was so profitable for so long. It made so much money. It was the best
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.520]   consumer electronics business, maybe the best business we've seen in modern times. And it looks
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.280]   like it's reached as pinnacle. And we have a hard time adjusting to that, Leo.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:48.560]   Yeah. It's also telling that this is that this is the first quarter in which they are not going to
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:54.880]   be saying, here are many units we shipped. Yeah. So we're not going to get that data anymore.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.200]   Instead, they're focusing on, here's how much money we're making per, here's our profitability
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.400]   per product line per user, which makes sense because now they can sort of shift focus a little
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:09.040]   bit away from the declining smartphone business, which is affecting everybody. And towards,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.120]   here's how much money we're making on services, which is something that we weren't making any
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.120]   money whatsoever on really over the past five or 10 years. And now we're making this
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.440]   and just boom, booming business. Hey, look at these deals we've signed at Sundance this week,
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.680]   which also point to what a great push we're putting into things that are not necessarily
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:34.080]   iPhone. And they can also sort of fall back on why are they falling short of their predictions?
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:39.600]   Again, they really laid the groundwork for this with that letter earlier this year by saying that
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.760]   essentially that they thought that the Chinese economy would continue to go the way it's going.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.160]   The economy is kind of starting to show signs of being in trouble. So there's a lot less confidence
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.800]   in buying high and luxury items. They're also having a worse time than they thought getting into
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.160]   other markets like India, as we've been talking about for the past couple of years now, Apple's
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:03.360]   success for the iPhone is starting to hinge upon selling iPhones to people who have not been buying
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.800]   iPhones previously. And that's a much harder thing for them to do. They're really good at making
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:15.600]   extremely well made luxury type items that have a lot of sort of umami to them. They're not
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.320]   really good at selling you the sort of like all weather radial tires that everybody puts on their
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.520]   car as opposed to performance fast in the furious sort of stuff. So they're going to they'll get
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:31.360]   through this again. There's a lot of new flashcards for Tim about the about this bug that's coming out,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.840]   but they're going to they have a lot to talk about and it's not going to be as dire as maybe
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.720]   pundits can talk about. Well, Andy, you just said everything else. I'll see you guys later because
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   that but I imagine Laurie, you and everybody who's covering this will go with a kind of a checklist
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:58.880]   of things you're going to be listening for. Yeah, always. Yes. Like what? Um, probably what Apple
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.560]   is going to say about it's what's going on with China. I think that the investor
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:13.680]   meetings for years now have kind of had a heavy focus on Apple's sort of jump into China and
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.320]   and how much money it's making, how well it's doing. So there's going to be a lot of talk about
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.240]   that. There's going to not just addressing the actual sort of lowering of the numbers, but a
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:30.960]   general sense of so what now because this has been Apple's not focused, but it's been an important
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.160]   issue that they've talked about for quite a few years. So this will definitely need to be kind of
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:43.120]   addressed for the investors and they're going to need to know how are you going to fix this,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.200]   basically? How are you going to make it better in the Chinese market now that you know that it's
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:54.800]   not as booming as it was before and the saturation level has been hit? What do you do going forward?
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.040]   And then that kind of goes back to what Andy is saying about services. So I'll definitely be
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.200]   listening for any hints or any discussion about services because obviously they're kind of,
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.560]   they're trying to work toward showing the larger picture of the profits that they're making instead
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.800]   of the per unit iPhone sales. They're saying we're not selling as many iPhones, but our revenue is
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.600]   larger, so pay more attention to our revenue unless attention to our per unit sales, which
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.520]   makes complete sense for a company that I want to do. That could actually backfire on them because
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.960]   if people aren't looking in inventory numbers, they're going to look more closely at other numbers
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.760]   and maybe even more speculatively at other numbers. One thing people are watching for is
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:42.400]   App Store sales with Netflix pulling out App Store, which is one of the big contributors to services
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:50.240]   may not be as valuable as a habit in the past. Subscriptions of things are definitely something
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:57.920]   to, that's a bad place to put all your eggs because the market, like our personal taste and
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.960]   things change constantly. So when you're thousands of people might subscribe to one
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.520]   service and then the next year everyone dumps that service and moves on to a different one or
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.120]   a completely different way of doing something. So using subscription as your sort of how much
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.800]   money we're making comes off of subscription is definitely a bad idea. And the Netflix example
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:25.200]   is a perfect Netflix is huge and they brought a lot of money into iTunes to Apple and they're
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.600]   not going to do that anymore. So that's a huge amount of revenue that's being lost for them.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.520]   And if all companies decided that they were going to pull out of the through iTunes subscription
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:41.600]   model, that's a lot of money for Apple to lose. So it's certainly a bad idea to focus heavily on
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.440]   how much money that you can generate from subscriptions and kind of like digging in on that.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.640]   It's better to, I think what Apple is, what we're hearing is that they're trying to create their
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.080]   own services that people will want to subscribe to and we'll probably be seeing a lot of that in
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.000]   the next year or two. Renee, what are you looking at this afternoon? You listen.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.800]   The next quarter's guidance is going to be one, it's traditionally not a very good quarter for
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.360]   Apple coming off the holidays. But this is a big quarter. Yeah, this is a big quarter. And again,
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.840]   it's going to be the second most valuable quarter in Apple's history, which is more money than any
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.440]   other company in the world is making. But people really care about the momentum, the growth. Is it
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.960]   accelerating or is it declining? And it doesn't matter how much money you're making if you're not
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.000]   going to make more money tomorrow. So that's a key indicator. And there's also a lot of questions
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.400]   like, yeah, Netflix is leaving the app store, but Apple is heavily invested in or the app store is
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.840]   heavily carried by in app purchases in video games. And we've seen Fortnite try to pull out,
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.440]   you know, Fortnite has pulled out of the Android store. Is that going to be a trend too? There
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.360]   was rumors just yesterday that Apple might go into the subscription gaming business because,
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.560]   you know, who knows how long they're going to be willing to just shovel endless amounts of
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.840]   whale-like money into video games. So the subscription thing is going to be very interesting
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.960]   with rumors, the TV service, the magazine, the latest iOS beta has Apple news for Canada,
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.320]   which is great news. But it also has hints of this Apple premium news subscription service.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.520]   And there's a lot more things like that. If you start adding the news service,
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.560]   the television service, the existing Apple music service to a games subscription service,
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.640]   they'll have to figure out a bundle so that we don't get subscription fatigue or subscription
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.600]   creep out of it. But there's a lot of room for them to play. And as Tim Cook pointed out,
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:30.240]   even though there's a lot of bad news in China, Apple's services revenue in China was actually
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.840]   up. And this is a country where people believe that nobody pays for anything, yet people are
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   choosing to pay for Apple stuff. And that's probably the silver lining we can pull out of this.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.360]   Yeah, I remember that we're talking about when we're talking about earnings call,
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.160]   we're talking about what investors are concerned about. And what they're concerned about is very,
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:52.400]   very sensible to the point of view of investors. As consumers, we don't care that Apple is making
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:57.120]   more money every single year, as long as they continue to stay in business and also be able to
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.800]   control their own destiny, investors are concerned about, we put our money in Apple,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.320]   not because we live our iPhones, but because we keep getting more money back. And so make sure you
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.720]   always have to partition on a day like this. The difference between stuff that is affecting your
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:18.720]   portfolio or your 401k and stuff that is simply affecting what your phone will be able to do in
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:24.080]   the next five years. Apple's saying anything about their streaming service, the information
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:30.800]   is reporting that it will be a spring launch. They will say anything, but they never talk about
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.640]   things like that investor calls. And they say, we don't comment on things that we're working on.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   So yeah, they won't mention it. Lori is absolutely right. They'll probably say,
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.880]   we have some exciting new products that we will be introducing in the second quarter,
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:51.280]   probably we'll hear. Which could be air of the air power or new air pods or
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:59.600]   new t-shirts that wouldn't include. Yeah. Yeah. Does Apple, Renee, never say anything?
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.960]   And he very rarely, I could count on half a hand how often they've sort of
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.680]   preannounced that it's always been incredibly strategic. Like Steve would drop by and join Tim
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:15.280]   on the call or something. And then they would maybe tell you when OS 10 was shipping, which they'd
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.600]   never said before or something like that. But it's never been a major, it's not the right platform
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:26.000]   for major product announcement. Tim Cook has two exceptions. He will talk about AR and he will
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.640]   talk about autonomous technologies. And we just had news about Titan Project. So it's possible
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:36.080]   that one of the analysts will ask something about Apple's autonomous future. And Tim Cook will
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.280]   say, it's great technology, it's the mother of all AI projects, and sort of give his stock quote on
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.720]   that. But that's just think, that's as far as we'll probably get in terms of future looking
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.600]   statements on Apple. The news was that Project Titan, their autonomous vehicle project had laid
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.800]   off 200 of its employees. Yeah. Which is, Guru point out, they reassigned them, they're leaving
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:00.320]   Titan and they're going to other areas in AI at Apple. Right. Also, that doesn't necessarily
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.240]   mean that Apple is losing faith in Project Titan. It means that like all, almost all companies
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.320]   are developing autonomous technology. They are doing the research to figure out what product
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.680]   they eventually want to make. And now they're getting closer and closer to figuring out,
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:17.040]   okay, we don't want to build our own car. We don't even now we don't even want to build a
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:22.320]   black box that goes into other cars. Now we really want to just build server software that helps
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:28.640]   over 5G other cars, derive themselves correctly. So that doesn't say anything necessarily.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:36.480]   Yeah. Yeah, it's in fact, there was new management at Project Titan. It's also could just be
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:41.200]   related to that. I mean, that's not an unusual thing. Yeah. Well, I mean, like, I've made this
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   point before, but can you imagine if we had the news organization we have today when the iPhone
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.920]   was first coming out, be like, Oh, oh, P1, someone has left the P1 team and joined the P2 team. Oh,
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.520]   there's controversy. Fidel is fighting with Scott Forest. Oh, no, one of them, I mean,
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.440]   it would have been a completely different experience. Would it would have been a lot more fun though?
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.320]   Yeah. They don't smell like pizza. They don't smell like pizza. What's going on?
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:08.800]   So what about this rumor that Apple might be planning us this comes from Cheddar,
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:14.560]   an unusual source for Apple scoops. Cheddar is a I think a television network, right? They do
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.280]   the streaming network. Yeah, financial network. Apple's planning a subscription service for
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.400]   games. Cheddar says, according to five people familiar with the matter, they apparently started
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:30.080]   approaching developers last year discussing a subscription service.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.560]   Megan and I talked about this on iOS today. We were puzzled because, well, there are
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:40.560]   subscription services for gaming Microsoft's game pass. For instance, 100 bucks a year and you get
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.160]   unlimited access to a large number of titles, including some A list titles.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.600]   And so it's about a one and a half game, the cost about one and a half games a year,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   but games on iOS, is it on iOS games on iOS? Five, ten dollars? What could they charge for
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.480]   subscription services? It's turning off the IAPs. That's a big deal for that stuff.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:07.200]   You get the full version of the game. They don't microcharge you. They don't charge you for
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.680]   upgrades for extra levels. You actually get to play and some of these games have been so destroyed
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.240]   by micro transactions, not looking at electronic arts so closely, but damn, electronic arts.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.600]   You've ruined a lot of games and they're just not fun anymore. They're horrible,
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.400]   horrible experiences that people get addicted to but don't really enjoy. And if you could alleviate,
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.640]   if you could give, and this is a terrible example, but if you could say, "Hey, this is the Nintendo
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.960]   Club on Apple TV. You pay 100 bucks a year and you buy the Nintendo MFI controller and you have
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.080]   access to everything up to the N64 games," or you have a bunch of Apple developer games and you have
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   access to all of these things and there's no IAPs, there's no upgrade purchases, there's no extra
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.640]   level packs, you just get full access to these games that might be compelling for people who
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.560]   surprisingly really love games. Yeah, I mean, if you think about this in the larger ecosystem of,
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.720]   "Oh no, no, they're going to be competing with NVIDIA streaming platform. They're going to
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:04.000]   compete with Google's project stream, which will put full board PC titles in any Chrome browser.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.120]   That's a bad and maybe a weird idea, but when you think about the iOS game ecosystem as its own
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:16.080]   self-contained market, as its own individual platform, and when you think about how worried
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.200]   every single parent is about their kid somehow getting access to their fingerprint or their
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:27.120]   passcode and racking up enormous amounts of charges for these pay-to-play games, the idea of
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.920]   saying, "Well, what if we just give the key? What if we just pay 10 bucks a month and we will let
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.640]   the kid download any app that works with a subscription model they can play forever and will only cost
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.160]   us 10 bucks a month?" That's a really compelling thing to tell parents, especially considering
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:48.240]   10 bucks a month. No, I'll never bother us again. No, you don't have kids. I would know.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:55.440]   This ridiculous, maybe a buck a month. 10 bucks a month? You bought your kid an $800 phone.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:01.760]   Okay, can I just say that? Can I just say that's the point? I bought my kid an $800 phone. He should
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:08.480]   be happy. Stop now. I need your password again. I ran out of Smurfberries. Dad, I need your
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:18.880]   password again. I just get so bored when I'm spending my weekend at Mom's House and there's no
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:25.360]   games to play. Gosh, she just makes me do my homework and makes me do yard work when I learn.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:30.000]   So do you think it'll be 10 bucks a month? Because that seems to me. I don't know. I was just
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.160]   probably just using that as an example. But that's my point. What could you charge it when making
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:41.120]   me do my best? But there's always been a problem with the cost of apps and games in the app store
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:46.400]   is that they're always underpriced. These developers work really hard on their projects
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:55.520]   and they have to charge 99 cents in order to get to buy them. And they, excuse me,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.320]   and not making enough money on it. So maybe this is a way for Apple to charge a lot.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.160]   And then these developers to get more than just 99 cents one time for their apps.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:10.400]   And there will be less of that in-app purchase type gaming going on because the game developers
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:17.040]   that I've talked to in my entire time of covering Apple stuff is that going the in-app purchase route,
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.520]   a lot of game developers don't even like those types of games, but they know that that's the
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.160]   only way that they can make enough money to get to the next game or to keep the lights on.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:32.000]   So they do those in-app purchase games, but they would prefer a one-time buy, but they can't charge
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:39.280]   you even $10 for a game without an uproar from the buyers of these games because they were used
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:44.160]   to 99 cent games. It was right out of the gate. It was a bad idea for games to be so cheap. And
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.080]   now there's no way out of it. Maybe this is a way out of it for game developers to be able to
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:53.200]   raise the price of their games or participate in Apple's subscription base so that they can just
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.560]   kind of get a little bit more for their game than they get now.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.600]   Well, I could see why it's good for developers in Apple. I don't see the value proposition
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:07.920]   to users at all. But if you know that you're getting quality and that you're not getting
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:13.760]   tricked into the game world, why do you think freemium works? People are because people don't
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:19.520]   want to pay up front, but they'll pay for ego or for instant gratification. So you're asking
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:24.720]   me to pay up front sight unseen, a monthly fee. I don't even know what the game is.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:30.000]   Well, you do it for Netflix, Leo. That's pretty different. I honestly don't think that for some
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.320]   people, it's not. But is it for a kid? I pay Microsoft's Game Pass. It's well worth it. But
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:42.160]   those are A-level games that cost 60 bucks, triple A games. I look at the games on
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.600]   iPad and wonder what would I be willing to pay a monthly fee of any kind, let alone.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:54.240]   Fortnite has controller support now. You could be flossing. Yeah, you pay for flossing, but
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:38:03.200]   Fortnite's free. I see it in the other direction. I don't see a whole lot of games on iOS that
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.560]   are these sort of, I'm going to enjoy for the next two weeks playing this game and getting really
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.440]   involved in this world. I'm seeing lots of little games that people just enjoy, just sort of like
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:18.480]   fast-twitching to for a long time or strategy games that it's not a big world that requires
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:26.320]   staffs of thousands of people in order to populate. It seems to me as though this is an okay value
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.680]   for simply saying, instead of you having to give someone a dollar here, $2 there, $3 there,
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.800]   all you can need to all these nice, smaller, more compact games that you will sort of use and
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:44.320]   discard over the next several days to a couple of weeks. It's an interesting proposition for Apple.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:52.080]   And also remember that any subscription service is essentially we're charging for
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:58.080]   electrons and air and electrons and air are everywhere. My house is full of them. And to be
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.560]   able to charge for them instead of someone you have to manufacture and source tiny obscure screws
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.640]   for, that's always an opportunity for Apple to get into in both feet.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:13.520]   What if the cheddar story is a little bit misguided because they only talked to five
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:18.080]   developers, Apple talked to them last year because of course developers also let's look at what
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:25.280]   if it's not just what if it's not just games? I mean, I could, I would pay 10 bucks a month for
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:32.400]   unlimited access. I just, I'm sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to quickly point out parenthetically
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.760]   that you're, I'm always a little bit suspicious of one of these interesting news items about Apple
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.160]   that happens right before the earnings call. It makes me wonder if maybe someone at Apple said
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:48.000]   we need to distract some attention away from some of the field. Maybe that's all I want to see.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.520]   Yeah, no, no, maybe that's it. Yeah. And what you're saying is definitely possible that like
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:40:01.440]   the conversations could have been old or according to cheddar from summer last of 2018,
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:06.560]   summer of last year. So, maybe Apple was thinking about it and did, you know, there's no reason that
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:11.760]   they might not have conversations on all kinds of things. So, this could be just a thing. Let's,
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.640]   let's pitch this idea. Let's see what developers think. Let's not and move on. It could be just
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.240]   like that. Yeah. If you're going to have a range of subscription services, if you're going to have
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.120]   Apple music and Apple television and Apple magazines and you know, in the future other services,
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.760]   having Apple games is not the worst thing to include in your, in your Alacart or in your bundle.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:35.120]   Is it impossible to do all apps? No, Amazon had all apps and there is, you know, there's the,
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.560]   I forget the name of that service on the Mac that has a ton of different apps.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.360]   It's just the value proposition is really different. It was sometimes, somehow mentally,
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.680]   you make it like apps sort of get Netflix is investigating game downloads as part of their
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.080]   next, their next, uh, flick subscription. It just full, it folds into that entertainment bucket.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.040]   And people have proven that they'll pay for entertainment what they want to pay for other
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:00.720]   stuff. Actually, if you, if you did camera apps, I would pay for that. I spent a lot of money
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.640]   on camera apps and filters and all that stuff. So maybe, maybe games is a
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.960]   subscriptions are, it's, you have two problems. One is you have subscription fatigue or people
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.160]   are like, every app is becoming subscription. And I just can't take it anymore. And you have
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.160]   subscription creep where it's like every app is going to subscription and I can't pay 80 bucks a
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.880]   month for the apps that I used to buy once. And you know, everyone's saying that, that, uh,
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.840]   subscriptions are the next big thing, which is what they said about an app purchases before
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.160]   people got tired of those. And the real problem is that we haven't found a way to support developers
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.960]   to make the apps that we want. We all want these boutique craft nice apps, but the only people
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.120]   who can afford to make apps really now are the ones that use data or hardware like Apple or Google
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:42.960]   to subsidize their, their, their creation. And we haven't come to terms with being willing to pay
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.760]   for the apps that we want. So we're going to get less and less of them. Apple does have some
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:53.520]   culpability for bringing the value, the price of apps down, uh, on, only by making a store. It
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.360]   would have, if it wasn't Apple, it would have been somebody else. Any, any craft when it hits
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.200]   mainstream, when you start, like they were in niche, there were so few apps, they were so expensive,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.680]   it was office, it was Photoshop, but as soon as access becomes ubiquitous, as soon as people
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:10.400]   realize, now I have access to 3000 apps, I only used to have access to three and I bought one of
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.120]   them every year. The entire dynamic changes, it's like mass production of toys used to pay a little
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.600]   wooden carver to make your kid a toy. And now toys are being pumped out of every plastic factory,
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:24.000]   mass production and, and, and lack of scarcity changes everything. How much did we pay for
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.480]   delicious library? Right? That was expensive. I know. Yeah. Yeah. But it was 1000s for final cut,
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:35.120]   right? Like 1000s of dollars every couple of years for Adobe suites and for final cut. And
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.440]   I would only buy one or two apps a year, literally only buy one or two apps a year. And now you'll
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.400]   like $1 dollar dollar dollar dollar. And on the plus side, I think for more software than ever.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.360]   Yeah. Yeah. Right. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Lori.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.000]   I think the problem with this idea of it, there were so few of them. So we paid more for them.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.640]   And now there's too many of them. So we pay less for them. That's that's detrimental to the,
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:03.520]   the quality program makers, the quality app makers, they have to reduce their price in order to
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:09.680]   compete with the, you know, the, the 5000 others that do do the same thing for free.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.720]   Because the, if I, if I'm a consumer and I go in the app store and I see this one that's $20.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:22.160]   And to me, it looks the same as the 1000 others that are 99 cents are free. I'm going to spend,
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:29.360]   I will, I personally wouldn't, but a consumer might actually spend a thousand dollars trying
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:35.600]   to find the perfect 99 cent app instead of just spending $20 on that expensive one because they
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:42.560]   don't want to spend that money upfront. So those, those good quality developers have lost out on,
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:49.120]   on this like mass production of apps that are cheaper. I, I, I personally think it's a bad idea.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.040]   Do we notice a, a ders of great apps on iOS?
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:58.560]   I mean, I would say so. It's, it's harder. Like you, you hear the developers talk about it.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.360]   Like there was a whole, I understand they're pitching, but they're not stopping.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.480]   Well, I mean, how do we, like there, there are developers and there's like really well-known
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.520]   ones who have stopped making apps. Like these don't make the apps they use to. They only make
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.680]   one app. They're, they're hard to experiment. They just know, or they go to work for a company
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.920]   doing contract work because, you know, Google can make as many camera apps as they want. It was
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.760]   much harder for Sebastian to wait to make your, or Ben Rice to make a obscure or a halide.
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.920]   I guess we'll never know if there's a great app that's not getting developed, but it feels like
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.640]   there's still very high quality, a great range of very high quality apps on iOS. People are not
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.080]   turning their back on the app store. I don't think. No, they're just trying to figure out how to
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.680]   like overcast this, try three or four different business models by this point.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.400]   Trying to find one that's sustainable. I'll just, I'll just, all I, all I want to say is that
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:50.480]   I think that there's a lot of crap on every single app store and it will way, way, way outweighs
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:57.120]   all the good stuff. I will say though that on the Mac and particularly on iOS, the quality of
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.960]   interesting, wow, I've never seen an app approach in this problem this way, or do this, this effectively
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:08.800]   in this cleanly or take advantage of a mobile platform as opposed to transmogrifying a desktop app
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:14.720]   so cleanly and beautifully and elegant as I can see on iOS. I've, I really like the Chromebook
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:22.960]   that I picked up a few months ago, but I really do miss having an app, having like my writing app
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:29.440]   or my, my markup app or my drawing, drawing app that for which there are kind of analogs on other
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.960]   platforms. You can get things, if you have a Microsoft Surface, if you have a Chromebook,
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.120]   you can kind of get these apps, but you can't get something like Scrivener, something that
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:43.600]   savory, an app, particularly a productivity app like that. So I think they will always have the
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:49.040]   best of the best. The question is, are there enough apps that are of that quality to distract
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:54.320]   people away from, hey, a Best Buy, I can get this Chromebook for 250 bucks or hey, look, my office
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.480]   is buying me Microsoft Surface devices. I'm just going to use that as my personal computer,
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.760]   but I think Apple needs to leverage how good the quality of their best apps are because they're
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.960]   just unsurpassed. Well, I agree. I mean, you know, we do an appcap every week on iOS today and
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.480]   there are plenty of great apps to highlight, you know. I don't, I don't lack any great apps out
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.200]   there. And as you say, Andy, some of them are really different and interesting and unique.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.640]   Sure, there's a hundred fart apps, but there's also some pretty.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:30.160]   Are there still? I think everybody who wanted a fart app has a fart app. I think that's probably
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.000]   are you accepting pitches? Are you saying that you're looking for someone to write a round up a
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:42.880]   fart app? No, in fact, if you think about it, I think really most of the innovative software
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:50.320]   design today is happening on iOS. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Let us, should we take a break? Yeah,
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.520]   let's take another break. I just, I'm really conscious of the time. I don't want to,
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:58.240]   I don't want to run into a deadline or anything for Renee and Lori who have work to do
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:06.400]   today, but I do want to talk about the screw, but what a teaser. Yes.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.840]   For the next segment coming up, it's screwing time. But first, let's talk about me.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:19.040]   Okay, Lori, are you a vegetarian? I'm not. Okay. Yes. Good. One of the best transitions I've
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:23.360]   ever seen you do, Leo. And I have seen you do really great transitions.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:31.200]   But you have a sponsor as great as butcher box. It just makes you want to talk about me.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:37.520]   This is like, this box is so big. Ah, there it is. Fortunately, I don't think there's any meat
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:43.200]   in here. I think maybe this is where our meat came in our butcher box. I love butcher box, by the
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:48.240]   way. It's better meat for a better you. This isn't just every day. Me, this isn't something to go down
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.040]   to your corner store and get, but it is kind of like your neighborhood butcher quality.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:58.160]   Beef, chicken, pork delivered right to your door. They were doing salmon, I think too.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:03.200]   Boy, we got some good Alaskan wild salmon that was amazing.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   Choose from hungry now. I know get ready because you're going to get more hungry.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.520]   And by the way, this just isn't just every day beef. This is grass fed, grass finished
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:18.880]   beef. If you've never had grass fed beef, the flavor is completely different from what you're
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:24.960]   getting at your local store. Grass fed grass finished beef is delicious. Free range organic
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:31.040]   chicken, heritage bread, a breed pork. They literally have better meat, partly because they
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.720]   believe in a healthier food system. They want everyone to access meat the way nature intended
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:42.160]   free of antibiotics, free of hormones, humanely raised. You know you are delicious. You're eating
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.640]   delicious, healthy, high quality meat. Now it's going to come to you in a big old butcher box like
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:52.640]   this one meets frozen at the peak of freshness in individual vacuum packed biodegradable packaging.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.800]   By the way, I love it because I can just throw it right in the sous vide machine,
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.600]   which we did the last we had some T-bone steaks last week. Actually, it was ribeyes and they
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.800]   were fabulous. And I just I sous vide them. And then I threw them on the grill. Man, they were good.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.760]   Each box is shipped with a carefully calculated amount of dry ice, which ensures it remains
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.480]   frozen even if after it reaches your doorstep. It's delivered to you for free.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:22.800]   And what's nice is you can customize your delivery easily, build your own box, choose exactly how
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:29.040]   much and what your family will love your delivery frequency. You also get recipe cards with tips
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:35.040]   to cook quality meals. This wild Alaskan salmon. Oh good. They do have it. Yes, they've announced this
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:41.680]   and this is brand new. If you haven't tried butcher box lately, this wild Alaskan salmon is the best
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:47.280]   salmon I've ever had in my life. It is pure, sustainably harvested salmon from Bristol Bay,
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:52.640]   Alaska. This is not what you're going to find in your local store. It is red, not because they put
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:58.480]   dye in it. That's they do with some farm farm just salmon. This is this is naturally
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.920]   red, fresh, delicious, and it's nutrient rich as you can get. It is so good.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.760]   All right. I'm now I made you hungry. Look at that. You get two pounds of this,
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:12.960]   two pounds of this free right now and $20 off your first box. When you go to butcher box.com/macbreak
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:18.400]   and intermacbreak at checkout, we sous vide de the salmon grilled it. It's the best thing I ever
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.760]   had in my life. It's amazing. $20 off your first box, but you don't have to sous vide it by the way.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.800]   I don't want everybody to think, Oh, you got to know you don't. In fact, we we talk
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:34.480]   to Tuesday is taco Tuesday at the La Porte household. And we the hamburger is amazing. Because again,
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:42.400]   like all the beef, it's a grass fed and grass finished. So it has such a delicious flavor.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:48.640]   And I made that we made the tacos that were incredible taco Tuesday. No sous vide involved.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:53.520]   butcher box.com/macbreak. Do use the code Mac break at checkout for $20 off and
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:59.280]   two pounds of free wild Alaskan salmon. Yay.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:12.000]   Hungry now. Butch.com/macbreak. This is the best sponsor ever. We got when the butcher box came,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.920]   they sent us three boxes so we could give Jason howl and Megan Maroney some for their
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:21.360]   aderies. And so there was my son texted me. He's right off his right outside the door.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:25.120]   There's three giant boxes of meat for you in the lobby.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:38.720]   Yay. So the for one of a screw, Apple's Mac Pro was almost lost. Remember how what a big deal it was
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:47.840]   that they were assembling the black trash can Mac in Texas in the United States. New York Times
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:56.960]   technology story, a tiny screw shows why iPhones won't be assembled in the US of a when Apple began
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:04.000]   making the $3,000 Mac Pro in Austin. It's struggled according to three people who worked on the project
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.880]   and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. It struggled to
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:15.520]   find the screws. Yeah. In Apple in China rather Apple relied on factories that can produce
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:20.960]   all the custom screws on a minute's notice. What do you want? We'll make it. You got it tomorrow.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:29.120]   In Texas, turns out screw suppliers a little harder to come by. They couldn't even test new versions
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:35.280]   of the computer because the 20 person machine shop that Apple's contractor was relying on could
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:40.800]   produce only a thousand screws a day at most. The Times says the screws shortage was one of several
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.840]   problems that postponed sales of the computer for months. Remember they announced it in December or
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:54.720]   October and we didn't get it until January. Well now we know. It was because the screws and in fact
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:53:00.240]   Apple we get screwed. Apple had to go to China. They actually ordered the screws from China in
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.760]   order to mass produce the computer in Texas. Home Depot. I mean did they check?
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:11.440]   They're custom. That's the problem. They're not. It's an old story but bears repeating time
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:18.000]   and time again. This is why Steve Jobs told Obama manufacturing jobs are not coming back.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.920]   It's not because it's not because of cheap labor. It's not because of favorable tax situations.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:30.320]   It's because there is a business order inside Shenzhen and other manufacturing cities where you
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:35.120]   can have a company that does nothing but manufacturer screws which means they have the capacity to
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:40.640]   build any screw you want on pretty much any demand at any quantity at any time frame because that's
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:45.120]   all they do instead of having to contract a machining company that is filled with incredibly
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.040]   talented people in the latest technology but they're machining company that will build pretty much
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:55.120]   anything. So when you say we need to build screws right now they may not have ever had to manufacture
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.600]   this particular part in this particular quantity. And also you're talking about a company that
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.960]   every time you have a every problem that could be encountered in manufacturing a screw they've
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:10.640]   encountered it and they've solved it. Every time and every time if Samsung for instance came to them
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:17.520]   with a they need a weird thread counter they need a weird profile to fit this weird sort of
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:22.240]   part that they've got that can't be any bigger any wider than this. They have they will figure
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.480]   that out and then the neck when Apple comes and ask them for something similar because they're
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.640]   also trying to get rid of this bezel where they're trying to put this component someplace they don't
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:35.520]   have to start from square one they've already had experience making this screw. That's the
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:41.920]   problem it's not even again it's not the fact that labor costs so much less is not as it is not
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:48.800]   the biggest problem I think the fact that there is apparently a culture of we're just we're just
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.920]   to put we're workers we are just supposed to do what we're told is also not as big a deal as the
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:59.600]   fact that you just can't get what you need at the time frame you need it if that's going to cause
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:05.920]   a company like Apple to ever want to build something in the United States of America so
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:12.480]   drastically because of economic situations or because of Embargos that might mean that they're
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:17.040]   gonna have to say well guess what guess what you cannot have that custom screw you have to order
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:21.920]   something from this catalog that we know that we've got a factory in in the Dakotas that it's
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:27.200]   just building these screws they've been doing it for 30 years they build each one out of a one block
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.920]   of Aspen log and they know how to do this sort of stuff it's really really difficult problem there's
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:38.640]   no solution to it so I have to say a little bit that this article might look a little like a
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:46.960]   justifying piece from Apple because you know you're right part of it is saying well it's not to save
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:54.000]   money that we manufacture in China that Cook said in late 2017 and the US what it is that to in the
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.840]   US you could have a meeting of tooling engineers I'm not sure we could fill the room in China you
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:05.360]   could fill multiple football fields they also in this article pointed out look we spend 60 billion
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:14.400]   dollars last year with 9,000 American suppliers 450,000 jobs you know Apple this is a little bit
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.840]   and I would suspect Apple had a little something to do with the writing of this article a little
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:23.360]   bit of a message to the White House that oh no really we're not only we're helping American
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:30.560]   jobs but we have to manufacture in China and I mean you could probably say look if Apple decided to
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:37.200]   use more standard parts or Apple spent some energy you know doing what they did in China already
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.360]   which is to build up manufacture the United States I mean a lot of this is because Apple
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:45.680]   intentionally created a manufacturing giant in Shenzhen.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.720]   This is some of so many things like a lot of decisions we decided to make I'm saying like
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:56.160]   North America America and Canada what we chose to value how we chose to do education my grandfather
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:01.280]   moved here at the age of 60 and he got a job instantly because he was a machinist and we were
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:06.160]   desperate for them Canada had abandoned all its trade schools had very very few qualified
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:10.160]   machinists and they would hire anybody that they could either fly in boating or any while
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.960]   again to the country and we we just don't have great education systems we don't have great trade
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:20.160]   school systems and we have not dedicated vast swaths of the Yukon or Texas to build these giant
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.880]   hub factories that can satisfy it but again part of that was because we have moved it offshore
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:32.560]   the Times quotes a manufacturer of screws in Lockhart Texas the Caldwell manufacturing company
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:41.520]   they made 28,000 screws for Apple but the owner and president Stephen Mellow said when he bought
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:48.160]   Caldwell in 2002 it was capable of the high volume production Apple needed but demand had dried up
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:55.120]   as manufacturing moved to China so you know this is something Apple's brought on in some respects
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.840]   right he said that well he had replaced the old stamping presses that could mass produce screws
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:05.520]   with machines designed for more precise specialized jobs because people are going to go to China to
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:11.040]   get the cheap stuff and so we're going to have to make something that is not quite so cheap yeah
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:16.160]   realize that every time a manufacturing plant shuts down in the United States the tooling is
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.680]   and the machinery is usually shipped to China they're usually built by they're usually bought by
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:25.200]   Chinese factory when the when the history of the world for the past centuries written it will be
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:33.760]   acknowledged that one of the most transformative both from a financial labor and a cultural perspective
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:38.240]   is the invention of the container ship that makes it really really easy to build something or
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:42.880]   manufacture a part halfway across the world that have it shipped across and Renee is absolutely
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:47.920]   right it's I think one part of the problem is that the United States and other countries
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:54.400]   countries just realize too late how important it is to invest in labor to invest in labor to make
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:59:00.240]   sure as part of your critical infrastructure you are supporting labor people working and making
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:08.960]   things because China did absolutely that they made they again based on whatever advantages they had
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:15.120]   as because they're their government setup they have the ability to simply say we've we have lots
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:19.440]   and lots of people we have lots of lots of hands to build lots and lots of things we can and now
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:23.520]   we have the ability to be of have a marketplace of the entire world we're going to take advantage
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:28.800]   of this the times also points out that another problem with manufacturing in the US American
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:34.240]   workers don't work around the clock yeah China's not the quotas economics professor from case
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:39.600]   western China's not just cheap it's a place where because it's an authoritarian government you can
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:44.800]   marshal a hundred thousand people to work all night for you and that's an essential part of the product
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:49.200]   rollout strategy you know apple doesn't want to make this stuff start making this stuff in April
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:55.600]   so you know the fact that we can crank out more in a shorter period of time is important
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.800]   have night shifts your group are took exception to that because it's all been working night shift
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.920]   for like for decades and we have night shifts and weekend workers here I guess that part's weird okay
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:10.560]   but we don't have it in the United States anymore is is the infrastructure of manufacturing there
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:17.520]   it's part of our history but we it all companies not not just tech companies but companies started
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:23.360]   getting things manufactured overseas that that's what happened so to kind of like we should just
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:29.600]   bring back factory workers and bring back factories it's so much bigger than that just one company
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:35.440]   can't just suddenly you know buy a building and suddenly have screws manufactured for them for the
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.760]   rest of their lives we we as a country decided that we didn't want to be a manufacturing company
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:47.680]   and now we're we're wondering why we can't you know fill jobs for for people in the United States
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:53.040]   because we pushed all of those jobs overseas and can't bring it back the like the the the ability
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.480]   to do it is is large all companies would need to come back to the u.s. if we were going to like
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.880]   reestablish like a strong manufacturing culture in the United States it can't just be one company
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.360]   or one year it has to kind of everybody has to do it to bring it back to the u.s. actually there
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:15.520]   was a spike in overnight night shift workers over the last couple of decades in the United States
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:21.200]   and the last I number I saw was 3.2 percent the entire workforce works overnight so we do have
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.400]   overnight workers but I don't know if we have slave labor work for two dollars
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.360]   and I'm sorry slave labor is a is a hard word because there is such a thing as slave labor
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.960]   say slave labor in the world the difference is that we do have a fundamental protections for
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.520]   labor labor has a certain amount of power that lots of politicians have been trying to chip away
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.080]   at and governor governors from the states have been trying to chip away at year after year after
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.720]   year but there is a fundamental system in place it says that there is a certain level of abuse
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.840]   that you cannot inflict upon a labor force even if you even if that labor force is willing to be
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:04.400]   abused but because they need that job so badly so I and the last thing I want is for us to go back
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:11.840]   to what the situation was like in the late 1800s early 1900s where really everything anything goes
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:21.040]   we had an unregulated labor labor industry and excuse me we had unregulated relationships between
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.560]   corporate corporate entities and their labor and labor and labor excuse me and these I'm so
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:32.480]   sorry I've been very very stumbling what I'm saying is that we had a system of no laws for a while
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:39.040]   we saw how badly companies were treating workers without any regulations overseeing them and we saw
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.880]   what happened we decided as a country we do not want that to happen and this is and the result is
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.840]   that now we have a system where people have a right to be paid they have a right to be safe
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.640]   I'm not necessarily sure that the same is true all over the world and that's our disadvantage as
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.040]   long as we have cargo ships going all the way across the world and that's where you know we
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:07.040]   that the it doesn't cost as much money to make people in in that are in unregulated countries
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.600]   work long hours with no safety measures in place to make sure that they're healthy so
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:18.880]   that's that's the payoff you know we we in the United States decided that we didn't want to
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:25.920]   treat our our us ourselves so poorly so we put regulations in place to protect ourselves and
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.640]   then the end result is that the companies just went somewhere else and did it to someone else
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:36.400]   so it would be so great to bring back this kind of labor in the United States as long as we could
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:43.200]   obviously keep the same protections in place for for workers so that you know you only work a 40
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:47.680]   hour a week or you get paid overtime for the extra work that you do that you have a certain
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.880]   amount of hours per day that you get to rest and leave you know to go be with your family things
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.760]   like that those are all you know part of those those regulations put in place to protect
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:04.640]   workers so if we could have that pay them the the a wage that that was sustainable to their families
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.720]   and have manufacturing in the United States yeah that would be great everybody wants that
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.800]   including these giant corporations that have moved overseas they want that too they would
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:19.120]   love that it would be great but it's not happening right now under you know by asking one company
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:25.440]   to come back or something like that you know as studs turkel one said time and said time and time
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:31.520]   again if you got to go home at 5 p.m. if you did not have to work on sunday thank the people who got
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:37.120]   shot in the middle of Chicago labor labor organizers and protesters who bought you that right several
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:45.280]   decades ago so ios 12.2 is out in beta and of course immediately Stephen trout and smith
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:54.480]   started pouring through the code and found references to four new ipad models including wi-fi
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:02.240]   and cellular models this kind of coincides with registration info for seven new ipad models
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.440]   that was delivered to the Eurasian economic commission database i guess that's like fcc
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:14.160]   approval in the u.s you got to do this in europe and asia so i'm gonna i'm gonna go to rinne richy
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:21.040]   who is our source code parser uh troughton's speculated there might be new ipad minis
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:26.080]   yeah and an ipad touch device without fingerprint or face id
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:35.360]   um is that all makes sense to you uh so the ipad mini has been rumored for a while you know
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.400]   apples as much as the ipad pro has gone up in price apple's been good at pushing the ipad
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:45.520]   the ipad nothing the ipad 9.7 down and adding new features to it like apple pencil support
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.480]   and bringing back the ipad mini with a non laminated screen would slot really nicely underneath that
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:55.200]   ipad and make an even more affordable option especially for education and for enterprise
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.000]   they wanted to use it in a mass deployment and apple pencil support on mini would be great as
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   well it would be like that my digital field notes of my dreams so i'm all you know i'm all happy for
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.160]   that the the non the non touch id non face id thing you know steve mentioned that it doesn't make
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:18.480]   much sense um it could be a very very specific device at a very very specific um price point
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.200]   but it's hard to see just not including touch id on anything anymore given how many how many years
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:29.920]   old it is and how relatively inexpensive that technology is now yeah i i'm sorry i had an emotional
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:35.280]   response to the idea i know right of a digital field yeah i i still have my three or four year
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.320]   old ipad mini i still use it so often because there are times where you just want something that's
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:47.280]   sort of like almost pocket sized uh and if i if apple were to create something like if something
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.560]   with the attitude of what if people who don't necessarily want a nine hundred dollar iPhone
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:57.680]   also want a really good ios device uh and they said and they were able to let's say take the
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.480]   three hundred twenty nine dollar nine point seven inch ipad and decide we're gonna make a seven inch
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:07.840]   ipad that costs even less than that that has all basically all the features of that one
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.400]   that could be incredible particularly if if the reduction in screen size meant a
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:19.920]   and reduction in physical size meant a reduction in actual cost to make it you can also imagine that
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:25.920]   little hands might be better with a little screen uh and it might be an even better solution for
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:31.920]   for education anything else but yeah i would be so that would put me back in line the night before
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:36.720]   the store opens for the first time for an apple product if apple decided to create a small a
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.760]   smaller ipad mini with a modern cpu so when would they announce these new ipads i mean if they're
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:48.640]   putting these in the database the erasian electronics database for the last two years like the the
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.120]   ipad five came out march two years ago ipad six came out march last year or it's actually april
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.880]   last year then april two years ago then march this year if apple doesn't march event which they've
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   done i think seven out of the last ten years and that would be a prime time for it but it just seems
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:06.240]   like they they've sort of segregated those ipads out into the spring and left the pros or the pros
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.440]   were out of one but yeah education timing exactly was that the last event was an edge it was that
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:17.920]   was the one in the school that was a chicago yeah chicago so an education event in the spring
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:23.680]   most likely i think that might have been my first mac break weekly oh wow april april
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:31.520]   those were the past first met laurie gill um yeah i would love to see a mini i agree with you
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:37.760]   andi that's what i'd get in line for i i gave my mini away because i had the ipad pro and as much
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:44.000]   as i love the 12.9 inch ipad pro which to me is the most amazing device ever i i almost wish they
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.080]   do a mini pro that's keyboard though leo that keyboard this is our keyboard that's not that's
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:56.400]   does your keyboard start up in a caps lock every time strider me nuts never every time i type
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:05.040]   it's caps i go huh so after all caps try restarting cap lock so i i did order and i
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:12.400]   hope to get by that time frame the the new um uh keyboard what was the bridge the bridge that's
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:19.920]   it b y g so adjacent snell of keyboards the jason snell it turns the ipad pro into a laptop
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.080]   yeah it does in weight size thickness yeah not quite in functionality
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:34.400]   um so it's the idea the idea of the ipad mini now that we're just kind of discussing it i'm just
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:40.400]   thinking you there's the iphone sc went away and there's been a little bit of kind of
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.680]   um research came back for like five minutes last week
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:54.320]   it's it's making me think that apple may be is kind of positioning okay so you want a big phone we
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:00.560]   can't make an inexpensive big phone so what we're going to do is sunset the less expensive big phone
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:07.120]   and we're going to make small tablets so that you can still be a part of the apple ecosystem without
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:13.360]   having to spend a thousand dollars on your phone it makes a lot of sense that if apple's going to
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:19.920]   get rid of the iphone sc that now is the time for them to bring back a very low cost ipad mini
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:26.320]   for those people who don't want to spend or can't afford to spend that large amount of money to
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:32.160]   enter the apple ecosystem you know phones have been traditionally the way um new people would
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.560]   come to the apple ecosystem and maybe this ipad mini is apple's way of saying we still want to
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.920]   bring you new people into the system but we can't make a good phone for the price that you want it
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:47.360]   but we can make a tablet yeah laura makes a really great point if apple really does
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.960]   want to double down on services they one the best ways to do it would be to make sure that there are
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.840]   of greater variety and less expensive really good devices that people can use to access that
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.440]   video service and that game service and that cloud service uh and maybe an ipad and ipad mini
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:11.120]   would really really suit that bill it's a really good idea we can only we can put that there you
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:17.600]   go uh what about uh we're we're in some power mat or whatever the hell they call that coming out
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.560]   air power air power the power mat i believe it when i'm sitting on the toasty surface Leo yes
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:28.480]   uh the verge says apple's next air pods we also keep hearing rumors about that we'll support
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:35.200]   hands free hay syri that's in 12-2 yeah i mean i don't think the verge said that i think german
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.160]   said that a year ago oh german said that okay yeah verge just repeating it now that 12-2 is that
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:47.760]   uh these are all things again we can but hope apple has decided yes we're going to pay
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:55.200]   the iphone photo contest winners it wasn't clear from the initial announcement they've added that
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.800]   to the announcement well the announcement was so i'm sorry go ahead it's okay they were always so
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.840]   like this is not the first time they've done these things they always pay a licensing fee
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.280]   of course even if they find your photo on the internet um so shot on iphone was not an apple
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:12.880]   thing they noticed people doing that on the internet and they thought it was the best community
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.400]   thing ever and they got fully behind it but whenever they've approached anybody they've always
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.960]   paid a licensing fee they sort of wanted to aim it at photographers and then the initial pushback
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.360]   was like i'm a pro i'm gonna get paid for my work how dare you and this sort of like it wasn't
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.080]   meant for pros but now you're getting all agro about it so apple was forced to make a statement on it
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.000]   now you see a lot of pros wanting to enter although that's the equivalent of spec work to me so i
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.160]   don't understand what their problem was with it to begin with but apple at the point is that apple
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:42.320]   always paid it's not that apple didn't pay they just didn't mention it if this was an algae contest
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:48.560]   no it was not a continent of well that's it's just that it's a it's an ongoing source spot not only
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.920]   for pros but also for amateurs that people that that so many companies will have a quote contest
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.080]   unquote where they hey create new content for us we will choose the ones we like and not pay you
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.120]   for it and say aren't you wonderful for having won this contest i did think it was very very good
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.280]   of them to make sure it was really really clear in the contest rules that we are not buying all
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:12.560]   rights to your photo we were buying rights exclusive we were buying non-exclusive worldwide rights to
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:19.360]   it for one year for the for use in these situations so it wasn't like hey thank you thank you for
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.600]   hashtagging your photo now it's ours now we've got this great you know we've got this great database
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.400]   of photos that we can draw from every time we need to test something or use something but yeah it was
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.800]   i thought it was important for them to mention that oh by the way there will be a licensing fee
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:38.320]   involved because that comes down to basic respect for creators and i don't i think it was just an
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.200]   innocent uh leave off i don't think it was that they were pressured into adding it but it was a
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.200]   slightly different take because i worked as a designer for years and we used to call contest
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.720]   spec work it's like we're doing a logo we'll pay the winner a thousand bucks you just want a thousand
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.440]   people submit a logo to you that we don't get paid for making right so i mean like so like none of
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.960]   this stuff like it's a contest allow it to be a contest you don't like this this was a very bad
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:05.840]   example of internet group rage to me i'm glad apple did specify it i don't think if you if you
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:09.680]   want to be offended by it you can be just as offended by a paid contest because you're still
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.280]   getting a bunch of submissions that you're not paying for it at the end of the day so there is
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.920]   really no way to limit the rage on this stuff but uh i hope it is a fantastic contest for everybody
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:23.040]   who as mature adults decides to enter it that that is a good point because in the press release
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.920]   it wasn't like hey hashtag us with your best photos and wool award reprised to somebody
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:33.120]   it really was oh by the way this is a juried sort of competition yeah we heard that here are the
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.880]   people who are on the jury and most of them are really really interesting people to jury
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.840]   jury contest but again i think it was a important thing for them to say that oh and of course we'll
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.400]   pay you for this uh yeah i think that that's a that's an important point to make is that in in
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:54.080]   when you're kind of an independent artist speaking as an independent artist um it's good to know that
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.560]   there are people that are on your side out there i've i've come across a couple of different
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:03.520]   situations where somebody didn't want to pay for the art because it was it was
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:09.760]   oh the person with the or that one of the art or that was displaying the art they're they're
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.200]   bigger than the independent person who was making the art so their their idea was well you're
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.760]   you're getting exposure through this so that you know that isn't that bigger than money
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:25.760]   offers too
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.320]   i could ask to design an entire video game for exposure i mean the entire the whole thing
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.800]   it just makes me so i tried to pay the rent by exposing myself to the landlord that didn't work
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.440]   that's the wrong kind of exposure i guess you should have shaped your legs first
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.520]   speaking of internet outrage
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.960]   the register says apple is patenting parts of swift
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:57.040]   but it's for your own good and apples in fact said uh it's and people have speculated that these
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:04.240]   patents on parts of the swift language are done under the apache II license and the intent really is
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:11.760]   defense not offense apache II grants users the right to use patent and cumbered code from any
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:18.000]   contributor including apple but the rights terminated upon attempting to bring a patent
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.400]   infringement claim against any entity over a swift project so if you might have read that swift
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:29.040]   is being patented and and you hope that's not true because it's an open source project and it
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:34.640]   shouldn't be patented that's probably not the reason it's good news they're doing it to protect
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:41.440]   you yes i believe that there's there's an entire industry around looking for uh looking for ip
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:46.160]   that is poorly protected claiming ownership of it not even like buying some buying a related
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.560]   patent and claiming infringement but claiming ownership of it and then forcing this company to
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.520]   fight it out uh so the apple could fight those battles uh and they are fighting those battles by
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.880]   essentially owning the patents on this code uh but an independent developer certainly couldn't so
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:06.400]   i certainly believe apple uh about when they're talking they say it's in it's in defense yeah and
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.000]   i think using the apache II license kind of yeah makes it else also apple is trustworthy in this
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.680]   regard so well honestly they want people to use swift in cumbering is not going to make more people
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:24.160]   use it yeah but on the other hand if you defend it that might make more people use it yeah they
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:31.600]   want to they want to be stripped yeah uh let's see um i don't care about apple patents although
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.200]   there's one on the iPhones and watches that would allow them to act as poisonous gas detectors
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.000]   okay uh you know it's a dystopian future Leo we're just gonna live in it
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:51.040]   until until 2020 until until a positive result for some people in 2020 let's just be ready just in
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:56.160]   case worst case scenarios happen and the drumbeat for apple's streaming video service which will
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:01.200]   almost certainly launch this year has ramped up a little bit at sundance yesterday they bought their
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:09.440]   first movie a coming of age film holla from jade pincett smith so they have the global rights uh
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.400]   they bought them yesterday which i mean you don't buy the rights to a movie unless you got a way to
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.840]   distribute it uh and i'm i guess it could just be iTunes but there's also some speculation on the
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:25.120]   information that they might make a hard word device and inexpensive apple t2v device uh kind of like
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:33.600]   a rautistic yeah oh the ipod touch there you go um so i think that uh what i would say maybe
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.040]   that's another thing we'd expect in a spring announcement yeah yeah the last one was just put
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:43.280]   out they didn't even have it in an event they just put it on the storage this this if you're gonna
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.840]   announce though a streaming service you're gonna have a big event it's good it's gonna be an
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.880]   education event either that's true no exactly it would be it would be a Hollywood event exact it
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.600]   would be like titled where they're gonna get a stage with nine or ten people that are gonna get
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:04.000]   ten billion views just on the just by virtue of the fact that this incredible celebrity is on stage
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.760]   in public somewhere so i mean this is it's it's this is gonna be two years in the making at least
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:16.000]   they've they've got if the oscars had trouble getting a host in three months time imagine how
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.400]   much how much work apple is doing to get make an event that's way more important than the oscars
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:26.640]   telecast yeah uh any other stories that i've missed that we want to get in because we want to get
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:32.240]   you out of here in a few minutes as we get ready for apple's fourth quarter uh results their analyst
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:37.520]   call and their press release in about five minutes the only one that really interested me this week
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:41.760]   as well was the etna app that apple cooperated with them on making which is interesting just on
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.240]   its own it's a is an apple watch app that tries to incentivize you to do things for your health
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.960]   it sends you notifications about flu shots and other vaccines about reminds you to make your
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:55.280]   doctors appointments all sorts so but there is concern because we've seen a lot of insurance
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:20:00.720]   companies use connected devices to deny defer or otherwise um you know we need a
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:05.440]   metal with your coverage so apple's done this thing with that now where you you download the app
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.560]   that's fine you can opt in like you get all the benefits there's no restrictions on it you can
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:14.880]   opt in to share your data which will help make the machine learning better like oh it's better like
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.240]   the most people respond to the notification in the day instead of night so we'll send more
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:22.720]   notifications in the day but in spring it's different so all that so it's double opt in if you want
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:28.960]   to share your data and also uh everything is encrypted in transit on the servers and etna is
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.920]   not allowed to use any of it for actuarial purposes which some people still don't trust and i think
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.000]   that's perfectly valid not to trust it i think we'll have to wait and see how it goes but i think
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.320]   at a certain point um these companies are going to realize that keeping their insurers healthier is
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:49.280]   going to lower their bottom line not just digging out of the coverage of data so this is uh it's
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:54.400]   called a tane you have to sign up to get it right now it's spaces limited sign up now and i presume
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.440]   you have to be an etna uh yes uh customer there's no point in doing this if etna's not your health
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.080]   insurance company and they reward you for following up on the goals by giving you discounts on the
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:08.320]   apple watch or if you don't want that giving you gift cards for retailers and he said it's like
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:14.080]   90% effective in helping promote um activity i'd love to see my uh health insurance do so
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.480]   i'm a caiser uh user and that would be really and that's the kind of thing caiser would do too i
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.280]   yeah they did i would love to see this apple had a similar deal i think with uh with uh john
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.760]   hancock insurance yeah i don't know i don't know whether it was this uh this intimate between the
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:33.040]   the insurer and apple but they had something similar where use apple apple watch tracking will give
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.240]   you deals on apple partburn other fitness products i'm considering signing up at great expense i might
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:46.080]   add for a um a diet plan called verda health i would love actually if anybody listening
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.040]   has any experience with it i'd love to hear before i sign up i'd love to hear about it but it has an
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:58.480]   app you you uh it's the idea is diabe type 2 diabetes reversal is through a ketogenic diet and uh they
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.920]   you do a blood prick you test your uh blood sugars and ketones and put that in the app every day
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:10.240]   you do uh phone calls telemedicine phone calls with physicians and support people uh they have a
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:16.400]   form it's an interesting digital hybrid they just raised a ton of money uh because it's a startup
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:21.200]   uh but it's also very expensive if you do it for a year which i think is how you do it but they
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:25.600]   have supposedly very good results so if anybody's done it i'd love to love to get some feedback
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:32.800]   before i plonk down my money um soilent just go with soy soilent i did soilent for a while you
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.680]   know i've done everything and i finally realized this is i did get by the way input from my actual
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:43.520]   physician who said well it's kind of expensive but uh and i'm not really a big fan of ketogenic
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:50.720]   diets i'd rather see something more plant-based but uh hey if you know if it works you know i always
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:56.080]   say it's cheaper than a heart attack so we shall see apparently kizer has according to
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:00.480]   perkley steven and our charram started a small project in oakland which includes a series of apps
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.640]   for the watch so maybe they are testing something else out that's interesting i don't i don't want
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.400]   a nitpick but if the heart attack kills you you're not buying any more soilent
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:16.960]   my point exactly it's cheaper than a heart attack right so so so so if so if death is so if death
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:21.200]   is not part of your plans then the math works out i see well i was hoping i survived the heart
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:25.440]   attack but you're right okay there's nothing cheaper than dying i i would i don't want to have a
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:30.800]   heart attack but if you once you're dead the costs go way down your your nails in here continue to
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:36.640]   grow but the but the actual life costs go way down i'm just being like i am i am db commentary
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:43.040]   where excuse me uh the heart attacks can be quite the next bit you won once you did
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:50.640]   wearing microphones made in 2013 i should also point out uh that the uh i don't know anybody cares
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.320]   but office 365 is now available in the mac app store yeah as far as i could tell the same office
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.160]   365 it's just in the app store and you of course still have to have a subscription
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:06.320]   for at least eight dollars a month to office uh so although Microsoft and Apple work together
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:10.480]   really hard to make the update process much more mac like and much i do actually like that because
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:14.320]   i don't like the Microsoft update or launching and taking over so the fact that it would update
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.840]   through the app store actually you know what that's a selling point that is a selling app
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:21.760]   also it's a it's a big pain of the but to make something work with the app store people don't
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:26.960]   understand exactly even just the idea of looking at being able to have a file an app that saves
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:31.200]   a file but that that means it has to have access to the file system which means it has to access a
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:36.560]   certain sandbox model uh i mean was it last year that apple did their big hey and here are logos
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:40.800]   of all the apps that are coming back to the app store um i i'm reminding myself that i should
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.640]   probably do a follow up and find out how many of us are actually there yeah because rich seagulls
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:51.040]   bear uh you know uh editor uh bearbound software's editor was one of those that he rich talked about
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.760]   it but is it in the app store now uh i don't think it's in the app store yeah it is not in the app
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:00.240]   store as far as i feel like i'll i'll ask if he wants to talk about if it's still i'm sure you
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.480]   still working on it so i doubt that he'd want to talk about until it's done okay that's just
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.480]   interesting topic just get a deep background you don't have to say who from uh and now that we've
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:17.280]   discussed it no one will be able uh i should point out and apple did certainly users will be able
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:23.360]   to purchase a subscription for office 365 from within the apps that we want to know what that
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.640]   deals like don't you there's a 15% upfront is it 10% 5% nothing does apple do that do they have
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.880]   different deals with different companies they had for netflix for a while before they made a more
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:38.160]   general policy so it took but if you are as big as apple there's a lot of negotiating as big as
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:42.400]   microsoft if you're huge yeah there's a lot of negotiation you can do all right let's take a
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:48.800]   little time out and when we come back gentlemen and lady please prepare your pick of the week
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:53.920]   i'm going to show you my pick right now which is this thing i've been wearing this or a ring i
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.560]   know you've seen it for months kevin rose turned me on to this he was on triangulation he was wearing
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.240]   i said what's that he said oh it's an oral ring it's the the new hotness uh he said i'll introduce
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:10.800]   you to the founder he did i talked to harpreet i said i'll buy one actually i think he sent me one
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.880]   but we've bought some sense because it's so good lisa has one the oral ring is the best most accurate
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:22.640]   sleep and activity tracker ever not the least of which reason is it's on your finger it's a ring
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:30.000]   it has measurements that other devices don't have it's got an infrared optical pulse measurement and
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.080]   by the way your finger is a better place to do that than your wrist or anywhere else
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:42.160]   uh with a 3d accelerometer gyroscope and a body temperature sensor i love my oral ring let me
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:48.400]   show you the insights you get i'll just launch the uh the aura app here and show you a typical
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:56.240]   day here aura tracks my sleep it tracks my activities it works by the way with apple health so
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.760]   anything recorded in the apple health app is also visible so i want to show you the whole deal here
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:08.160]   so you see here it shows it gives me a readiness score this is based on a number of things not just
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.840]   sleep but things like heart rate variability it turns out the more variability in time between
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:19.120]   your heart beats the better we're talking in microseconds is tiny variation but you can actually
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:25.920]   see what that is you get a sleep score and that sleep score is a lot of stuff what kept you up
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:32.160]   what your what your time your latency getting to sleep was like let me um let me go see some of
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:39.520]   my trends here my bedtime trends daily weekly and monthly so you know oh i've been getting later and
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:45.520]   later as time goes by uh how much time you spend in deep sleep and this is an interesting insight
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:51.200]   that you get the more you exercise more i exercise the longer my deep sleep is things like temperature
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:57.760]   where you wouldn't even think uh that would be important but it turns out it is in fact these
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:03.920]   little micro variations in my body temperature are really important overall for my health let me go
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:09.280]   back to trends here overall for my health so i'm going to go to the readiness readiness section
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.240]   and i can see over the last 30 days variations of body temperature when it's getting a little higher
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.200]   like right here i'm getting a little sick now that would that is less than a one degree differential
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:24.080]   but it's enough to notice and they have lots of information about what these insights
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:31.120]   mean this is great the heart rate variability is fascinating uh again higher is better so i was
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:37.520]   doing better in october than i am this month i got to work on that all of this is tracked easily
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:43.680]   and instantaneously in the ring which is great because the ring is lightweight it's titanium
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:50.160]   it's waterproof it's got a diamond like carbon coating so it's light strong and completely non-allergenic
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.440]   i wear it in the bath in the shower in the hot tub when i swim you wear it all the time and unlike
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:02.000]   a watch or anything else uh a fitness band uh wearing a ring to bed for me at least is is a very
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.720]   easy thing to do that doesn't bother me you get bedtime guidance sleep quality measurements
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.680]   sleep stage tracking so you know how much time you spent in r.e.m how much time you spent in deep
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:17.600]   sleep life sleep um georgia would love this your sleep trends yes you get all sorts of readiness
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:21.600]   insights on your resting heart rate by the way my resting heart rate is very good i'm glad to say
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:27.120]   heart rate variability you get uh activity insights for instance it'll tell me today be a good day
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.560]   to work out hard or you might want to take it easy today daily feedback really helps you understand
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:38.000]   your body improve your health reach your goals it's very light you can't tell by looking at it but
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.240]   it's lighter than a conventional ring because it's titanium they've got the heritage shape or the
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:48.640]   balance shape you can get them in silver black stealth they even have diamond if you uh if you
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:53.120]   have a fancy lady you want to give a diamond ring to they have a diamond version as well that's
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:59.360]   a great engagement ring it lasts up to one week charges very fast can store a couple of months of
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:04.240]   data so you don't have to and by the way it just it just as soon as you open the aura ring app it
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:08.480]   pairs with the phone it's already paired it's a bluetooth lely so it'll start downloading
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.320]   immediately so it's very easy to download the data but you don't have to do it every day
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:16.480]   i am a big fan we've got uh let me say i can show you some of these actually we have some
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:21.680]   more as in different colors and shapes we can save you 50 dollars off your purchase when the

[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:41.200]   one it's very very simple let me get this one open this is the heritage silver
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:47.520]   by the way there's no it charges on a little stand in fact you'll see this when i open it up this
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:51.840]   is the stand that it charges on you just put that on your bedside table and it just goes right on
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:57.200]   there and charges so there's nothing to connect uh this is the silver one that's quite pretty i don't
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:03.120]   think they sent us a diamond one and if they did lisa's already spell are you taking it you'll get

[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:31.360]   time for a pics of the week i shall let lory gill kick us off lory okay so i'm going to london
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:38.400]   next week and because of that this is the first time i've flown more than six hours and i'm totally
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:43.440]   worried about how uncomfortable i'm gonna be so i bought myself an infinity pillow what i haven't
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:51.360]   used it on an airplane but i've tested it out here at home it's um it's a pillow but it's more like
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:55.440]   an infinity scarf it's just as big oh this is so much better than those things you wear around
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:33:03.040]   your neck yeah you can you can use it in a bunch of different ways um i i am the kind of person who
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:08.480]   will just sort of let my neck fall forward and fall asleep yeah so you can make it so that the
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:15.360]   the meat of it is right here so your chin won't fall or you can make it looser so that it kind of
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:20.400]   cushions you here or there you can wrap it around your arm and use it while you're leaning against
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:25.840]   the windowsill you can um like put it on your arm so that it can be a pillow when you're on your desk
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:34.240]   um you can use it for a little bit of um noise canceling or light masking i haven't tried those
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.240]   features because i i'm not i'm not on a plane so i'm not sure how good they are but i love the
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:44.240]   variety of this you can do so many different things with it and if you are if you're a traveler
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:50.240]   you probably have fallen asleep on a plane or tried to fall asleep on a plane and realized how
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:55.440]   uncomfortable and difficult it is i've woken up with drool down my face so embarrassing with that
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.000]   arm fallen asleep because i'm leaning against the wall so i i'm hoping the infinity pillow is going
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.240]   to do the job for me and i have messed around with it at home just sitting on the couch or i've used
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:09.440]   it as a lumbar support while i've been just sitting here at work and it works for that so
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.600]   even if i even if it doesn't help me sleep on the plane it's already a benefit to me that
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:20.240]   i've been able to use it just at home i'm ordering two right now i am because this is one for me one
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.800]   for Lisa this is totally what we need it's great yeah what were you gonna say Renee one for my back
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:29.840]   one for my butt no but that was way funnier than anything i can come up with which is one
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.520]   one for each head is that what you're going to say all right you are not a dutrillo Leo
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:40.160]   i could be a dutrillo oh a little pokémon go humor
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:47.840]   Andy and aco you're pick of the week well a couple weeks ago we're talking about one of my
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:55.680]   favorite tipples the pepsi 1893 which is the made with real sugar and really nice spices and
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.160]   flavors and it was it's the only sugar there's really sweet and drink that i keep in the house
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:05.440]   because it's like my special treat and a lot of people were really excited about it and started
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:10.240]   asking where they can get it and that's when i discovered that just a few weeks ago pepsi
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:16.960]   discontinued this product so you can't get it anymore now how dare they i i would pour i would
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:24.240]   pour one out for for it but i've of course drunk every single last drop that i have and now i'm
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:28.960]   looking at now i'm every time i'm in a supermarket or passing by a supermarket like let's drop by
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:36.160]   and see if they have any pepsi 1893 so nothing gold can stay ponyboy nothing gold can stay apparently
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.280]   i told the universe that there is something that gives me a small amount of joy and the
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.520]   universe said and he doesn't deserve even a small amount of joy or maybe they said that
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:50.080]   Andy's close enough to diabetes as it is that's maybe what they were saying maybe we maybe we
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:56.320]   shouldn't kill Andy with his daily dose of sugar and caffeine we so beverage
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:01.440]   beverage manufacturers including at the big beverage manufacturing districts of Shenzhen
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:07.120]   i now have an opening for a new office sweet and tipple if you'd like to buy that sponsorship i'd
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:12.000]   i'm i feel as though i'm ethically forbidden to accept a spon paid sponsorships or anything tech
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.800]   related but if you want us if you want me to like instagram like me pressing your product against
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:22.560]   my face and saying how much i how much i love it oh what how many cases do you have in you know
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:30.800]   backstock i have zero Leo because it's again it's 12 cans a month and i was down to like maybe my
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:35.600]   last can by the time i found out about last week and got the notice from amazon that we're having
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.120]   problems filling this item and now and even now if you go on amazon you can buy a 12 pack for 60
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:48.480]   dollars instead of 14 dollars and oh i'll be fine i'll be fine speculators really jumped on that one
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:53.760]   right away yeah and i was like great 60 60 dollars for what's going to be a case of stale soda
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:37:00.960]   i'm sure a month ago it's anyway oh well so i just wanted to let i want to share my pain let
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:06.160]   people know please stop looking for pepsi 1893 and stop asking me where i can find it because if
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:11.840]   i'm finding it i'm like a lane with those contracentive sponges like i'm i'm there'd be a closet with
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:17.520]   just nothing but pepsi 1893 if i'm trying to get someplace i'm buying it for less than 60 dollars
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:23.040]   lori i just bought two of those infinity pillows but that's great i hope you like them i i already
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:27.120]   like the one that i got and i haven't even flown anywhere so i hope you like it i think it's great
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.920]   no i it's a i you know it's neck pillows never did it for me because i like you seriously like this
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:35.760]   mmm and so that sounds perfect yeah it's not in the middle there that's that's what
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.880]   also it's more flexible because like i like to put it up against the if i have a window seat i will
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:47.520]   sleep on the window so having that ability is very nice for me yeah oh look we found some uh
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:58.000]   some pepsi four yan ebay and the only 109 dollars for 12 ounce cans that's again this one of them
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.360]   isn't this isn't wine or whiskey it doesn't get better the longer it ages but wait it's the last
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:11.760]   one and it's the last one yeah i've i see i i better get used to not having it in my life or as early as
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:18.480]   possible i don't know why but ebay has categorized it under household supplies and cleaning vacuum cleaners
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:27.600]   it is household supply 1993 but vacuum here's the pepsi 2093 oh the future of pepsi that's the
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:33.280]   vanilla pepsi which is now love the future back on shelves that's what gets me angry they got
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:40.240]   cherry diet cherry vanilla pepsi which no one who loves themselves will buy and drink voluntarily
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:46.000]   but with any self-respect whatever by that especially if you could get all the sugar
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.280]   100 number for the Samaritans on the on the side of the label because you have clearly given up
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:59.840]   uh i'm sorry i'm bitter i'm bitter i'm bitter um my pick is ridiculous but since Alex Lindsey is
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:06.400]   in here i thought i should pick up the mantle of the high priced spread oh owc has announced the
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:12.160]   version 2.0 with their thunderblade i've always you know if you've got a thunderbolt 3 port and
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:19.040]   most macbook pro modern macbook pro and iMac pro users do have you want a thunderbolt 3 drive not
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.400]   some cheap usb 3 on a type c connector drive not a thunderbolt 2 drive you want
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:33.520]   2800 megabytes a second and uh now you can get it in a very attractive it even apparently comes
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:38.720]   with its own pelican case a very attractive thunderblade you know it's actually not that
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:47.360]   expensive 799 $800 let's make it $800 for a terabyte um terabytes 3500 now that's now and
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:54.000]   maybe that's a little pricey but uh the portability and the beauty of this and it's so fast i don't
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.920]   know i don't have one but i sure i sure think that's a purr a bit Alex has a fortress of them yeah i
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:04.880]   i'm just doing this for Alex to make him happy it's just it's just one Alex for a terabyte
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:11.280]   come on terabyte parallax one terabyte parallax exactly Renee rich he your pick of the week
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.280]   so a lot of people know giermo rambo from nine to five mac or he does a lot of the interesting
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.400]   articles but he's a developer which is what allows him to do a lot of those deep dive find the strings
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:27.120]   discover the hidden icon sort of stuff and his day job is making apps and he's just released his
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:32.400]   new app and it's called air buddy and the idea of this app is it's so easy to pair airpods with
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:37.280]   your iphone or your ipad you get that little beautiful interface that comes up and shows you
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:41.600]   and prepared connect all of that the mac you have to go to the menu bar like an old-fashioned
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.800]   animal and click on it and and choose the airpods so he made a version of the ios interface for the
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.880]   mac it's five bucks it was ten bucks but there were so many complaints he dropped it down to five
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.640]   bucks and now people are complaining it's not ninety nine cents and he responded it's a very
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.000]   nice thing you're not even you responded very nicely saying for ninety nine cents i just
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.720]   assume that they're watching television and never make an app again so five bucks well worth it less
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:08.000]   than you'd pay for a really large triple quadruple espresso and you can enjoy it every day just
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.240]   seamless very nice very very good integration for airpods for mac and it also works with all
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.320]   people asking where beats buddy was and he said it's the same app as long as you have a w1 chip
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.760]   this app will give you that that interface and let you enjoy your airpods as elegantly as ever
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:28.560]   on your mac so i can check that out i think it's air buddy i'd select the link in the and then
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:34.480]   knows but i think it's air buddy dot something air buddy it's for you it's your body and the air
