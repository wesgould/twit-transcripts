[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.920]   The October fest edition to opt for news
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.380]   It's Andy Naco here from Canada
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.880]   No, he's just his hat. We're all Canadian today. We are aren't we?
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.480]   Yes, Andy is at the Chicago Sun times. It's just practically Canada. It has Canadian weather
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.080]   It's closer to Canada than can California
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.600]   Arizona yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.800]   Hey, that's also an actual Canadian sitating mr. Renee Richie
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.960]   I just want to assure our American friends that the Liberal Party in Canada is not using the word the same way that you folks usually
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.080]   We should understand that true liberals are the are the socialist party the GDP not GDP NDP
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.440]   And DP National Democratic Party those are the real liberals
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.720]   Yeah, we're odd and in Quebec the liberals is a far right because we have two levels of socialism left of them
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.600]   You have Greens - we have the liberals and we have the Quebec party and then we have the people who thought the Quebec Party wasn't social
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   It's not so they made the new socialist party
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:01.840]   Funny I think it's adorable that you're trying to make Americans who don't even care about our own elections care about some foreign elections
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.600]   68% voter turnout if that doesn't shame us. I don't know what will and our campaigns are like two months
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.680]   In history yeah, the longest in history
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.440]   Be be be fair. I think a lot of those people are just voting to go inside and be warm
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.960]   Yes, how long takes to get to actually vote
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.880]   They put a little hot out on the ice Tim Hortons coffee inside
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.120]   Anyway, it's great to have you both and it's great to talk about Apple
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.600]   And I guess probably the main thing we should talk about is last night and I'm not talking about the election
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.120]   I'm talking about Tim Cook on the stage at the Wall Street Journal
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.600]   Was the Star Wars trailer you're gonna say oh and that
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.920]   Here in America those of us watching American football was really strange the Sunday night football which is one of the big games
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.800]   It's like hockey night in Canada just to put it in perspective for you
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.480]   They made a big deal in the whole first half coming in the in the in the halftime
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.120]   We had a halftime show the Star Wars trailer
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.360]   Can you believe Tim Cook made a bunch of announcements when everyone was watching the Star Wars trailer come on Tim?
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.920]   Actually, it was precise timing. I guess because some of the I think you would say we're not super good
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.480]   But
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.320]   He was probably watching the trailer in his Apple watch
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.320]   That's probably it refused refused to talk about Apple Watch sales
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.360]   But he did say that we sold more in the second quarter than we sold in the first for the second
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.960]   I guess second quarter the first and we expect to sell more in the third than we sold in the second that kind of thing
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.320]   Sales are going up in other words now
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.760]   Do you believe what he said about how we're not gonna give sales figures because that's valuable information to the competition our competitors
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.080]   Well, it is a it is a brand new category and that would indicate here's how much money there is out there for people who actually
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.000]   From people who actually are interested in this product
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.400]   But you do notice that they they've never
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.480]   It seems as though when something is a clear runaway success. They're not willing to deny their competition news about how many pre-orders of the new iPhone there were
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.080]   Yeah, I
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.720]   Can't he regrets it like he said that he were if you were to do it over again
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.160]   He regrets that they were so open in Canada about iPhone and iPad and I think under his watch he wants to keep that stuff closer to the vest
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.360]   Well, it's really a no win for him. Isn't it? The only company that does it
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.280]   I mean very few other some companies will hint at sell in but not sell through Microsoft is the same thing. Yeah
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.080]   Yeah, and Apple is really the only one who puts their numbers out their quarter over quarter and you know
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.600]   He may not think there's a benefit to it. He's probably right
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.680]   I mean, it's a no win because if it doesn't do it does if the numbers not big
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.520]   That's bad. And if the numbers big people said yeah, well, so of course
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.960]   It's not bigger than last time right but what yeah, but how was it? Yeah, so you can't and of course Apple
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.160]   Mostly does it when it's the biggest ever right?
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.720]   Probably shouldn't give out numbers, but maybe they have to with the Apple music because
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.080]   They have stakeholders the record labels
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.160]   Six and a half million paying subscribers
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.600]   15
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.920]   Million users that is free. You know have more than half free
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.960]   Compare that to Spotify, which has 20 million paying users
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.760]   It's not bad. It's a lot better than the Beats platform much they bought which had a hundred and ten thousand
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.600]   Yeah, particularly when you particularly factor in how younger services
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:36.880]   Spotify has had years to build up this base and it was also the there was also no real Spotify in the mix when Spotify got launched
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.560]   Whereas Apple is brand new Apple music is brand new and it also is competing against a product of people who and it seems
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.280]   It seems as though anybody who is really really interested in subscription music has already found Spotify or failing that Google music
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   So I don't think this is a failure by any means
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.560]   60% conversion
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.640]   Factor if you take eddy q on his word in August that there were 11 million
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.760]   trial users
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.560]   but
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.840]   You guys how many of those people have people forgot to switch it off after
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.860]   Out of hundreds of millions of iOS users - how big is that number right?
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.280]   I'm sure the Apple wanted that number to be bigger and hopes it'll be bigger
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:24.360]   Do they do they have to reveal this because they part of the part of what's going on as a public relations campaign with?
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.960]   Taylor Swift and the labels and you know convincing them that this is a platform you want to give exclusives to and beyond
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.560]   That number does not I
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.320]   Don't know I was curious that he wouldn't that he would actually give out the number
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.640]   I was surprised because it is a like everyone is doing it everyone knows these services
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.400]   It's all the same music catalog right everyone in the space that if they didn't it be a parent that they weren't doing it
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   Right whereas with the watch no one else is doing that sort of information right?
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.960]   Sorry Monday, I could well not Sunday night. Yeah. Thank you all the same it you have to know that
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.640]   You can't believe that Tim Cook said anything during that that he was not prepared and planning to
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.280]   Say so I have to believe that he planned to
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.040]   Plan to release that number he did not plan to release the Apple Watch number and a lot that has to be tactical
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.040]   Exactly though. So that's what we're trying to analyze is what the tactics here why?
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.120]   He also and I guess this is probably the I probably buried the lead the biggest thing is Apple TV will start
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.960]   Shipping at the end of next week. Can you be able to take pre-orders this coming Monday?
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.140]   And
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.880]   Internationally, I don't know about every country, but it's more than us to like order in Canada
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.040]   Which you know it doesn't sound like a big thing, but most that top boxes don't do that. Yeah, of course get I'll get online
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.920]   I don't have to get up on month at midnight on Sunday night. I don't know
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:49.600]   He said that linear viewing of television. This is a term of only recently learned linear is where you watch a show one show
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   Then another show another show like TV
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.520]   He says that is disappearing and the current TV watching experience has outlived its usefulness to Apple TV with its ability to search across
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.520]   Various streaming services and interact with apps
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:09.680]   I think the search across services is very strong as to has quote developed an infrastructure to fix a terrible broken thing that none of us like
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.400]   Going around that Apple was gonna create basically a TV channel and force you to watch ads and if you listen to Tim Cook's
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.040]   It's the opposite of that. Yeah, the starting gun. He says has been fired
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:28.040]   That's Apple right there. Nobody did anything until he does it right till Apple does it waving the red banner of revolution
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.680]   Leading the people to victory at their freedom
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:38.840]   So I also get the feeling Tim Cook probably doesn't sit down of a Friday night and watch a lot of TV
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.560]   Strange not seeing Mossberg did that interview because that was a little staple for years. Yeah, and no red shares either
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.600]   They took those yeah, that's all it white white or verge or ever that yeah white. Yes
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   All part of the code parlor part of retoad now. No, but recodes part of a vog. Yeah, vog
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.960]   So it's all very confusing the media landscape the starting gun has been fired
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.800]   They're all racing to the finish
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.320]   He also did not say he said I decline
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.920]   According to the Wall Street Journal. He declined to address Apple's interest in building an electric car
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.480]   I would like I hope he did say in fact. I decline to address that
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.960]   He says he sees a massive change coming up in the mobile in just I'm sorry the automobile
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:30.880]   industry as a major technology shift the sector away from today's combustion engine focus
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.080]   Must be fusion fusion
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.600]   diffusion
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.600]   Right here for it by the way
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.720]   Okay, I'm swearing an Apple watch but my Android where it does have a flux capacitor
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.880]   Watch face on it
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.400]   50 that has a dymo label that says you know protect eyes when don't look into the flux capacity
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:59.080]   I'll be wearing that tomorrow October 21st the official back to the future day
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:04.160]   He says he sees this is I'm quoting from the journal again
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.960]   Software electrification and autonomous driving technologies playing a crucial role in cars of the future
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:15.440]   Here's the quote that industry is at an inflection point for massive change not just evolutionary
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.640]   Change does kind of imply he spent a lot of time thinking about this and
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   That maybe the starting gun has been fired on this one as well
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.520]   Yeah, well, it's interesting that we're not even we're not even necessarily talking about
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.040]   Revolutioning cars as a consumer item. We're might be talking about cars as a service
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.640]   Where so many people that don't necessarily need to have a car in their driveway?
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:48.040]   24/7 might want to avail themselves of driverless taxis and the ability to sort of segue an entire city
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:53.960]   Public transit from bus systems that may or may not work to the ability to have cars on demand
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.560]   That's a pretty that's a pretty big opportunity that almost everybody's trying to look at right now. Yeah
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:06.520]   By the way, do you read anything into it that this conference from the Wall Street Journal is W SJD?
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.520]   What would Steve Jobs do?
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.560]   You read anything into that at all? No, okay coincidence come when kidding
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.440]   But I can't help but looking at it and thinking what would Steve Jobs do?
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.440]   I'm sorry, but that's what I see when I see W. S. G. J. D. I don't know why
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.800]   That's just what I it come it just it's in there
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:38.280]   So I guess you can can you watch the video of this or is this just you should be a basically providentially? Yeah, here it is. Yeah
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:45.600]   He spoke with the editor in chief of the journal Gerard Baker not not quite a Walt Mossberg. Yeah
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.120]   Walt's gotta be just
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.960]   And the chairs I'm sorry where you know these white canvas directors chairs
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:59.300]   That's cheap looking should have gone with purple or blue or something something something distinctive
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:06.520]   Okay, but don't don't you did you ever look up to see exactly how much those red chairs cost? Oh, no, are they pricey?
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.760]   They are twenty two hundred they are twenty two hundred twenty three hundred dollars chairs. Wow
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.740]   But there you know what they're smart because that's really become the trademark and they I think it's so funny that Walt and Cara
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.480]   Just said hey are you gonna we can we take you're not gonna use those are you?
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.040]   We'll just take those chairs with us. You don't mind and the journal said no. Yeah, we don't want those
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.560]   We have white canvas
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.360]   I choose the cafeteria. We would just pull these out. That's fine
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.840]   All right, is there anything else
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.640]   The runway here is really good
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.720]   says
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.360]   Tim Cook of Apple music the runway here is really good
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.960]   That means we could get bigger
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.760]   CEO way of saying there's a there's a little bit of an upside to having six and a half million subscribers better than the
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.760]   Clifton of us is really deep
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:06.920]   When when a CEO talks about runway, they're acknowledging they haven't actually taken off yet. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:14.840]   Okay, so somebody's saying cook didn't really say that watch sales were going up quarter over quarter
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.560]   He made a joke that they were I don't know the distinction. I'll have to guess I have to watch the video
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:27.760]   Yeah, that's what you so that's a problem if you read a transcript and it just says that and but you don't understand that he was like nudge nudge
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.920]   They're going up every quarter wink wink
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.460]   Maybe not historically they go their high at launch and high it well not as
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:41.140]   That right as new but for an Apple product they're big at launch and they go for the holidays, which is right up
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.840]   right I
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.760]   I'm sorry, but I just I don't I don't see a lot of people wearing Apple watches and I just don't feel like that's a
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.840]   Not that it needed to be I mean it's fine
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.520]   But are you wearing an Apple watch no are you?
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.800]   Watchless and these are people who watch Mac break weekly. I'm wearing an Apple watch
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.200]   I'm wearing enough, but I'm one often wonder why
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.920]   Did he mention the Hermes
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:15.000]   Saturday's reviewing the the doobletour right now. She is like a girl. Did she buy one?
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   No, we got one because it was they weren't available on Boston
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.320]   They were only available in a few cities and one of the few benefits of having in our office in Miami
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.520]   Is that they had it of course they have in Miami?
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.040]   Of course. Yeah, they sold out at least the ones that my boss wanted sold out within minutes
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:37.520]   I think the he wanted the cuff one and that was gone. I think the product that sold off just tell him not no do not
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:43.720]   Do not he's a Hermes collector already he buys a bracelets normal. Okay, it's not people like us Leo
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   people
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.200]   We're also talking about Tim Cook's appearance
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.800]   In a debate with the director of the NSA
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.040]   Was this this I don't I'm confused. This isn't
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.320]   So minutes after
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:09.520]   NSA director Michael Rogers said there needs to be a balance between safeguarding user privacy and our ability
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.120]   The NSA says to identify security threats
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.600]   Tim Cook said absolutely not
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:22.320]   Cook said you can't have a backdoor in the software because you can't have a backdoor that's only for the good guys right right on
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.080]   Strong encryption go ahead
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.000]   They asked him about a police state too
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.800]   And he made very similar comment about that that you know
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.480]   That's even in a hypothetical world if there was a police state if you can't get into something you can't get into something
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:43.200]   It's the only absolute that matters at the conference Rogers said strong encryption is in our nation's best interests
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.920]   That's not what I said
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.960]   Security encryption good
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.780]   The ability this is very cryptic
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:58.920]   Security encryption good the ability to generate insights as to criminal behavior and threats to our nation's security also good
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.840]   Well, that's the problem isn't it?
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.680]   and
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.840]   Cook's response. I guess it wasn't a head-to-head debate. Cook came right after Rogers
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.280]   Cook said nobody should have to decide privacy and security
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.960]   We should be smart enough to do both and he compromised is a cop-out
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.880]   Both of these things were essential parts of our Constitution. It didn't say it prior tries it prioritizes
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.960]   This one above all of these
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:33.800]   I mean these guys were really smart folks since Tim Cook and they held all of these things and said all of these are what it means to be an American
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   It become increasingly important more important to more and more people over time as they realize that intimate part of their lives
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.440]   Parts of their lives are in the open and being used for all sorts of things
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.440]   I mean this is of course apples one of apples real strengths
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.160]   It's also in some ways one of apples weaknesses is this support for?
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:57.040]   Privacy and I only say it's a weakness because they're faced with companies like Facebook and Google who will use what they know about you
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.520]   to give you
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:04.440]   Information that some people appreciate like the good an extra services and features that Apple can't duplicate without using that information
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.000]   I shouldn't add Microsoft to that list because now of course Microsoft does the same thing on Windows 10
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.600]   Which has raised the hackles of privacy advocates like Steve Gibson
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.720]   I for one wish to give all my information to our overlords
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.480]   I just like that we have options if everyone did the same thing we'd have no ability to choose
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.680]   But that companies take different approaches and you can consider Microsoft maybe a little bit of a little bit of a choice
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.720]   This one's best for you. Although I think Google is starting to respond to this
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:36.320]   Maybe is a maybe over respond because they just they took out of Chrome the latest version of Chrome
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:42.480]   The ability to talk to it and the Google now feature that would show you your Google now information is no longer in Chrome
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.040]   And I have to think that that's maybe in a response to private
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.200]   I don't know privacy advocates wasn't it wasn't it for a while it was triggering?
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:54.240]   unintentionally it was enabling itself all this stuff triggers itself unintentionally doesn't it?
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:01.280]   Well, maybe they're just fixing it. He'll come back. Don't say Alexa or you're gonna get the raise the ire of the Amazon Echo owners
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.880]   Don't say hey
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:08.640]   I think they're also having a problem with microphone access and they need maybe that's a little bit maybe that's it
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.620]   I also think that there were a lot of people saying hey that means you're listening to my computer. No
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.560]   Yeah, I don't know why that's better
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.280]   In a phone than it is in a computer, but yeah, I think Google has an ongoing problem with that
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.080]   There's just like Apple for a while had a problem with people just assuming that well
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   This is an Apple product doesn't run
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.680]   MS-DOS doesn't run Windows and therefore it can't be used for business stuff
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.920]   I'm not gonna trust it implicitly because of that and I think the good was running the same thing
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.160]   I mean, I've got the new Nexus phones and I'm at at my coffee shop
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.240]   I'm about to say oh, that's right. I need to get I need to set set this up with a password for those for the Wi-Fi of this coffee shop
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:53.080]   Then no because I use the feature where it just simply says please just duplicate all the things that I need and it's all set up
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.040]   for all my hotspots all set up for everything like that and
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.320]   I like that because that's super convenient
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.960]   But a lot of people would say that wow you mean that you somewhere on a server that I don't control
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.560]   There's the passwords to my life has your wife passwords
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:10.080]   Yeah, and you're and you're sending cars driving around street after street after street is this a good thing. Maybe not
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.000]   Yeah, come on. What could possibly go wrong? Yeah
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.720]   How do you like those your thoughts you think you got to the review units on Friday?
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:26.800]   Yeah, I got I got both of them and I like them a lot so far have this this morning was actually my first time like out with the
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:33.720]   Nexus 6p the camera looks pretty good so far. They're built really really nicely you get used to the
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.240]   fingerprint reader in the back because
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.380]   Of course, I can't stop like just trying to I know how to retrain my thumb
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:47.560]   But it's but it's cool to be able to take it out of your pocket and your finger just goes here while it's being while you're moving
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.640]   Up to your face and by the time it's up to your face. It's unlocked and ready to go
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.040]   Really really great stuff. I mean this might be the best Android phone. I've ever used
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.440]   Yeah, that's what seems to be the consensus Jason. How has a couple?
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.200]   He's gonna review this 6p for before you buy and I guess Miriam Schwar got the 5x to review
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.880]   Yeah, we'll cover them both. Yeah, and then I'll spend more time with the 5x and tonight. I want to know about Android
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.060]   Yeah, yeah, we're showing those off and then we're also showing off and
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.080]   This show yeah
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:22.760]   M9 it's the a 9 a nine Miriam will be bringing it in okay. Yeah, yeah looks a little bit like an iPhone
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:29.240]   This points up the difficulty Apple has because once a year they come up with a new phone and there's nobody who disagrees that the new iPhone
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.920]   6s and 6s plus are superb
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.760]   arguably the best smartphone made
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.520]   But they'll but the spotlight shifts very rapidly nowadays
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:46.680]   And there's always something new and I don't know if good I guess consumers really at this pointer the decision is iOS or Android and then
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.560]   You know if you've decided Android then you have to make all these other choices
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:58.400]   Yeah, but it's like Granny said earlier. I'm so glad that it used to be that all the superlatives belong to the iPhone and the
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.720]   Superlatives of the the only superlatives of the Android were philosophical ones and now you can get superb
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:10.040]   superbly built phones running and operating system that has that's really pretty and really easy to use and now
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:17.840]   There are so many so many phones that have really great cameras too and that doesn't that's not a case of anybody falling behind or you know
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.480]   Not innovating again. It's a chase where now you can simply ask yourself what phone do I what kind of features are important to me?
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.560]   And then get that thing and maybe even choose between two or three instances of that thing
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.560]   I would I do wish we still had all terms
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.960]   I was gonna say I wish that palm and black are you were still around and I forgot that Windows phone was still around but I
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.920]   Wish that there would be a stronger three
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.480]   I like three is better than two you bet. Yeah, absolutely. It'd be nice to have the choice
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:47.160]   But it's and it's but let's let's just let's just assign some of the blame for that if Google decided that they're gonna start
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.480]   Supporting Windows phone with apps. It would be not it would still be a third
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.040]   But it wouldn't be a distant third. I think it's stupid that Google is saying that no
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.320]   We're not gonna do anything with Windows phone right for a company that prides itself on being everywhere
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.400]   It's it is so exactly not there Netflix is on board kindle is on board
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:11.120]   Hulu was on board ever node is on board the only major player that is not on board is Google and that is deeply suspicious. Yeah
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.120]   Somebody's pointing out the new HTC phone
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.840]   It much looks like an iPhone
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:25.680]   I love HTC. I love the HTC since the trio pro. I've I love the early Android designs
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.000]   I like the character of their designs. I was talking about this with Jason before the show
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.360]   I love the early Android because you're at the droid which looked like a krillian starship and you know all this variety
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.560]   And I wish I wish we had this variety now because I want to get an Android phone
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.480]   But I don't want it to look like my iPhone I want it to be a different phone and it's I'm getting harder now
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.000]   Yeah, well, but it's also it's also historically funny because
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:53.880]   You know, you see a lot of talk about people who are more design oriented on the Apple blogs making so much fun of this part of the Nexus 6
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:02.040]   Design that has this this bar this hump at the top of it to accommodate the larger sensor and the and the antennas and stuff like that
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.000]   So I mean it does look different. It is nice. But nonetheless like we're collectively
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.640]   We sometimes jump all over companies that try to do something that's not like minimalistic and you know
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.560]   Not not an Nordic sort of Norwegian woods. It's where to design
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.800]   Because square past port everyone makes funny. Yeah, that's that's like the one of the things I like about that
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.520]   This is the case that Google sent me with the 5x. Oh, that's the one I ordered. I love those cases
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:33.440]   I know I know it's like I still miss this case off of my off of my old iPhone as like
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.120]   This is this is how close
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.680]   phones have become yeah, the fact that the fact that I can get the exact case that I like on this Android phone has just given
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:48.720]   This made me more likely to switch back to Android. It's not funny. I have that case on my iPad mini
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.560]   This is like the greatest case they're grippy. They're good looking they look a little bit like
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.200]   something out of Star Wars
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.960]   And also it's like the only case
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:05.200]   I've one of the few cases I've seen that fits as well as an Apple case where it's just it's like a it's like space shuttle
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:12.560]   Component tolerances it fits so closely. I just don't like when there's any play whatsoever between a case and a phone
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.000]   Yeah, spec makes that one S P E C K
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And they make a lot of kind of sleeve style phones, but that one in particular is is a really good looking case
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.800]   I wonder if they still make yeah, they still make it for this. They call it the candy shell grip. Yeah. Yeah, baby
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.080]   In any color you could imagine you put you put this
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:41.240]   I'll carry about is you put this on the armrest of your sofa and it's not gonna fall off and really on your on a tile floor
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.760]   Really? Yeah, it's pretty awesome. I'm that yeah, I ordered that on the I noticed they had that for the 6p on order
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:57.120]   Was I gonna say oh well, I guess I'll move on I was something about phones
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.880]   Let's take a break. We'll come back more with Andy Renee and
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.640]   Apple news
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.720]   I could show you my new case for my iPhone 6. This is kind of overkill
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.320]   This is this is pad and quill you've heard of them. They make this handmade leather cases
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.960]   The thing about this is it makes the phone actually like much bigger
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.000]   I can no longer fit it in my pocket, but it does look nice even got it monogram
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.960]   And this is fake looks like you got a fake bookmark in there because and then it's wood
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.880]   It's made out of wood
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.600]   So it's kind of like a wallop case I wish if I wore suits
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:39.040]   More I would totally own those things classy. I love them
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.400]   I've actually bought a couple of those things like the that wallet folio case
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:49.200]   Yeah, I want to be the sort of sophisticated like James Bond sort of guy that can pull that off, but I can't it just
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:55.000]   It's like no, no, I just I just want to ever know something. No, I just want to play my bebird for a second
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.440]   No, it's just the the super cover is exactly what you want. Right. It just doesn't get in the way. Yeah
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.160]   Our show today brought to you by Linda calm the online learning platform
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.600]   We all love so much and partly because so many of our friends

[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.960]   Microsoft word in fact they because they work with the publishers
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.360]   They have courses already for word for Mac 2016 for instance up and running with
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.680]   Word for Mac 2016 they had that out day and date
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:56.600]   There are courses on the new features in OS 10 and it'll be that and always 10 and it can be that an essential training
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.160]   Plus an overview of the newer features on iOS 9 so
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.360]   You know what there's been shown us how to learn to be a better photographer if they

[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.800]   I've got a lightroom a course going right now. I'm starting to do a little coding with Swift
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.160]   They got some really great coding courses for brand new coders, which is nice
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.440]   I like coding as a hobby body language for leaders. Isn't that great?
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   Isn't that awesome? That's one of the the business skills courses. Here's the deal

[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.400]   Speaking of edit capitan
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.920]   Somebody did a fun thing
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:47.400]   Law he's both a lawyer and a coder a programmer and he took he actually read the license agreement
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.000]   something many of us don't do
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.560]   Yeah
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   Oh
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:01.880]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, do I have it linked here on the rundown trying to find this article because I want to read you in
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.960]   plain English the El Capitan
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.040]   license
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:16.920]   He translated for us he translates it's actually nothing really crazy in there, but some things that maybe you didn't know
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   This is a
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.640]   Link from nine to five Mac. I can be required to climb El Capita
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:30.520]   Rob Schechter who did this on the Rob report R. O. B. B. Report and
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:36.720]   He says I decided to upgrade my Mac to El Capita my computer said on one condition
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.920]   I must carefully read and agree with something and even provided a
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.520]   Cozy display window for viewing it where you get to see about ten lines at a time, right?
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:50.760]   And I did what everyone else would I cleared my afternoon schedule and got right down to business reading carefully the entire document?
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:56.440]   Turns out I was much too pessimistic. I only needed 33 minutes. I should note
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.040]   I'm an attorney with a good understanding of license trademark and copyright law
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.120]   I'm also a software developer with 20 years experience
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.600]   So your own read through may take more or less time accordingly
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.720]   He broke it down into 22 points
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.040]   So if you're curious what you've agreed to with the new OS 10
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:22.320]   I can't use he calls it the captain with illegal copy he's translating it right with illegal copies of anyone's stuff
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:28.920]   Apple doesn't sell me this software. They still own it in fact. I'm just borrowing it and if I install more Apple software those are
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.520]   Unknown as well I
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.480]   Can use the captain in two virtual machines and on one computer
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.600]   Which is a weird thing to say since of course it's free
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.800]   Yeah, but there you have it. I think it's the VMs thing
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.600]   But these VMs cannot be used for business
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.480]   Who would use OS 10 of virtual machine?
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.120]   server companies, okay
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.280]   Okay, the only exception is for software developers
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.120]   So if you're a server company, you had one machine and you had 20 instances of OS 10 you'd have to license each one
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.960]   I guess yeah, I've got to read the separate rules that come with the fonts and obey them
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:12.440]   I'm only borrowing those fonts too. Mm-hmm, but that doesn't that VM limitation doesn't apply to admins does it?
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.480]   It says the only exception is for software developers that'd be really surprising
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:24.160]   And because one of the one the biggest users of virtual machines are admins who like to create instances for every
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.000]   Insulation they do I don't think Apple's going to come to your house. Yeah, but it's
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.840]   Like the hackintosh market. Well, there is a hackintosh clause as
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:39.680]   Well, I'll get to that moment those but how would that affect a virtual machine though?
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.360]   Hackintosh's are always about change the bootload or so you can actually boot natively into it
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.520]   Right, we're just running a bunch of Mac installations on your on your PC. Yeah, but I said yeah
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.520]   I don't know. Can you do that? I mean I know I mean I don't wear and run
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.280]   I think they don't like me. I mean it's the artificial. They don't let you right?
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:02.760]   Yeah, well, I think that there was this this would clobber on two instances that service that went up for a little while that allowed you to
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.680]   To with a netbook or a Chromebook or a tablet
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.840]   Use a virtualized copy of Windows 10 in Microsoft Office
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.440]   Right, excuse me Windows. Oh, yeah, you remember that yeah on and you can even do it on your iPad, which is cool. Yeah
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:24.120]   Apple's Robert. I mean Mac it's a Microsoft clobber that I believe but that but that would also be if it weren't handled by
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:29.640]   Virtualization limitations would also be handled by you can't lease out this offer for other people. Yeah, so
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:35.840]   Those cool boys number seven those cool voices for the clock you may not use them in a remix
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.640]   Oh, you rappers. I know that Jay Z. Yeah Kanye's been eyeing him
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:47.560]   Slide shows made with photo same deal don't even think about using them for some commercial purpose. I
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:53.680]   Still can't sell access to my Mac via any kind of screen sharing there you go
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.520]   So you can't lease out a Mac
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:04.160]   By a screen sharing I must run it on Apple hardware that bands hack and tosses in I can't help anybody else hack and toss
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.600]   I can make one copy as a backup
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:15.400]   Unnecessary but okay. I can't try to figure out the source code to any of this can't reverse engineer it
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.560]   I must follow all local laws
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:22.400]   While I'm using it and he he adds really wherever I live
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:29.840]   Because some of these local laws are weird you may not use it with the code. Yep. You may not use it while it flows
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   Mm-hmm. You cannot use it in a car
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.440]   And I use it going for me. Can't use it in a bar. I
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.000]   Do not lock these software licenses
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.760]   Please do not put el Capitan up your nose
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:49.920]   Or any other opening anywhere if it's I can leave software on the Mac if I sell it or give it away
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.400]   I
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:58.320]   Better not use anyone else's hacked version though Apple isn't responsible for my hurt feelings for anything I see on the web
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.680]   You didn't like that star wars trailer. That's your tough your problem
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:09.960]   Don't come sue an apple if I break any of these rules the deal is over and I must immediately delete everything
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.880]   El Capitan comes as is I
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.600]   Cannot send it to Sudan. I
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:20.360]   Cannot send it Sam. I am I cannot operate a nuclear plant
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.320]   I'm just waiting for the rhyme go ahead
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.200]   I'm gonna make a kunex joke, but even not as hell and I cannot do not think about it
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:38.320]   Just playing can't make money and this is the one that worries me a little bit from mpeg h.264 or a VC videos. I create
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:46.000]   For that I need to buy another something from somebody so if I were to edit videos on my Mac
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.680]   and then put them out as let's say a podcast called Mac break weekly is
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.840]   That in h.264 form which we do in fact is that illegal?
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.240]   To violate the license make sure you have a copy of X.264 on all your machines
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.080]   Wow, well, we actually use windows now
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.600]   But I bet you I wouldn't be surprised if the same clauses in a is in Microsoft's yeah, and peg LA is not on our side
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   Yeah, yeah
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.760]   That's what that's all about right so that Apple's just that kind of saying hey
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.640]   We don't have to pay your license for you see we explicitly prohibit this
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.120]   yeah
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.360]   Thank you if you want to if you want to sue 8 million
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:31.760]   El Capitan users individually go here. I guess you're not gonna say what don't come to us don't complain to us
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.880]   Thank you the Rob report for breaking that down
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.760]   at a mckidded yeah, it's nothing really that you wouldn't expect I think
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.560]   But it's good to know
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.440]   Apple has launched a new
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:53.720]   Shareclass r s or no is it a new class well restricted stock units r s use it's a program
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.120]   They had for people that they wanted to retain and now they're making it available to everybody
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.800]   So it's a new version of an existing program in in much greater scope
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.960]   See I'm so glad that I have Renee here because he actually reads these well
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:11.120]   So one of the things that Apple has a problem with his retention because other other companies offer benefits Apple can't always match
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.300]   For example Apple needs a lot of people to work in Cupertino and other companies will let you work remotely
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.440]   Apple doesn't always pay the same amount as a startup
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.940]   They don't have the same kind of IPO opportunities as startups
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.560]   What they do is a grant stock that you can then later
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:29.600]   Sell at certain intervals and before they did that with people who they thought were key to the company key engineers and system people
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.860]   They really wanted to retain but they're realizing that there's people all through the company even the massive retail operation
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:40.960]   But they want to give similar incentives to so now this RSU program is is broad and almost everybody can participate good
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.600]   It is harder for a company like Apple that is an old, you know
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:50.840]   And Silicon Valley terms an old company and doesn't have a stock that well of course your stocks pretty valuable
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.420]   Yeah, but there are people who change jobs every three years just to get in on the hot startup
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.600]   That's gonna sell or gonna otherwise make a lot of money and that's very tempting to a lot of people
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.380]   That's where the real growth is is company about to go public right? Yeah
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:07.980]   The other upshot is that it gives Apple way to buy themselves back without having to actually buy themselves back
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:13.960]   Because obviously if people in the family are buying up shares shares and blocks of stock that
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.760]   Basically takes shares away from people who are gonna be at the at the meeting saying
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.500]   Why why are there?
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.900]   Where are their children with two hands in foreign countries that aren't being paid 10 sec 10 cents an hour to
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:32.020]   Ensemble your phones and Tim Cook can say well because we have a soul and we don't want to be bad people
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:36.940]   Yes, but what about my stock? What about our shares? So what so your shares to an Apple employee?
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:42.200]   They're an Apple employee will be very very happy to be on board with all of our yeah, I like that
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.940]   Here's some
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.540]   Is not that bad probably not bad news at all
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:54.520]   Apple has been ordered to pay two hundred thirty four million dollars to the University of Wisconsin
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.180]   This Pat what is this so the patent?
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:04.500]   Was created some years ago by a professor and a couple of graduate students the University of Wisconsin
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.840]   It is a patent for a microprocessor
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.380]   Technology and the jury
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.520]   Well, well Intel apparently settled yes
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.480]   So we don't know but what Intel paid as a license fee
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:24.200]   But Apple decided to fight it first they went to the United States patent trademark office and said this is a bad patent and the US
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:31.480]   BTO said no, it's a good patent which was now that's a tactical error which we considered against the patent role
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:40.560]   Because then when you go to a jury trial the lawyer and the jury trial says by the way the patent trademark office was asked twice to review this patent
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.560]   And it's not clear if they're a patent role because they are definitely not a
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.200]   But yeah, they're a university and they and they're their research means a lot to them
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.380]   It's basically the value they create and you know
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:57.400]   I should point out the universities generally own the the things created by its students and professors to wit Stanford
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:04.840]   Owns part of Google and makes quite a good packet of money on it. Yahoo - other things probably as valuable to them
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:12.280]   So this is not at all unusual that this is a 1998 patent on something called a predictor circuit
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.040]   It was developed by a computer science professor and I'm sorry three grad students
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.480]   And the problem is you get a non-technical jury
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.800]   And they have to assess this
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.360]   They did find that the a7a a and a X processors
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.040]   violated the patent
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.400]   Apple and an X are coming up in a separate litigation. Oh interesting. So this is an over yet
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.680]   Yeah, Apple argued that
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:44.720]   Wisconsin deserved less than the hundred ten million dollars. Oh, they did settle for within over a hundred ten million dollars
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.920]   2008 so we I didn't know we knew the amount
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:57.880]   Apple said that worse patent entitled it to as little as seven cents per device sold so Apple was really haggling over the price
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.160]   Not the patent
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:05.280]   They get sued a lot and they generally don't want to set a precedent that they'll just roll over anyone who wants patent money from them
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:11.720]   234 million to be fair is probably not a whole lot of money for Apple certainly nothing compared to the amount of money they made on those devices
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:19.480]   So it's just everyone I mean they get sued for VPN software for communication exchange and all those add up. Yeah
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.800]   But yeah, I think that was I guess the question that we were asking is
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:30.600]   Can you consider wharf which is University of Wisconsin's licensing arm a patent role and no I don't think so I
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.160]   Don't know about the patent because I don't have the technical chops to assess that but
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.040]   Hey good news I work for iCloud is out of beta
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:53.040]   Does anybody use that because it's really kind of cool
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:58.600]   It's it's a basically web based versions of the I work apps and they're great
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.840]   They're terrific for everything but what a lot of people use online tools for and that's collaboration. Oh
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   They don't have collaboration huh not to the extent that people are used to now with the Google products
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.560]   That's too bad because that they're beautiful and they're really almost as fully functional as the desktop versions
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:21.520]   Yeah, I think that that one of the reasons for developing that was basically because you're not going to be able to
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:27.960]   You're not going to be able to sell installations of I work as a standard for school for an office unless you also have an online option for it
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.920]   I mean Google is just doing such a great job of making the Google the Google app suite
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:40.240]   Just standard amongst offices standard among schools as Renee says not just the depth of the apps themselves
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.560]   It's how easy it is to collaborate between groups with them
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   And if Apple wanted this to if Apple wanted I work to denik did be about as useful as the chess app
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.520]   Then they could have avoided this this step
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.400]   But as as they're kind of back into a corner here it works it works great
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.640]   But I just have it's hard for me to figure out how to
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:06.840]   advise someone to use I work instead of Google apps if they want actual online online utility
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:13.560]   Does save them from making a PC version which we've seen through it like iTunes on PC is not the ideal situation for anybody right?
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:18.400]   Yeah, unfortunately the most of the people who are going to be attracted I work to begin with are already going to be invested in
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.760]   iOS and Mac OS products so they can run the native apps as it is
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.320]   It really is just to capture that remaining 5% actually
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:31.240]   I'm not even sure so much to capture users so much as to have that tool in the argument of why you should why it's okay
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.040]   If you guys to standard on standard eyes on Macs because if you have people don't worry if you have people coming in with you
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.480]   With your windows tablets or with with the Chromebooks or anything else like that
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.320]   Don't worry. We also have online versions of these same apps
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.520]   So it's not as though everybody's gonna have to buy or acquire Apple hardware, right?
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:53.040]   And it works quite well. They used to didn't used to complain that if you didn't use Safari and now I'm using it in Chrome
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.440]   It doesn't complain. It works crime. It looks great
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.320]   I've used I've used them on Chromebooks and they work great
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:04.640]   I mean they if anything it's like a really big gift for people who want to spend $200 on a Samsung
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.200]   Samsung notebook because they are certainly the most desktop ish office suite
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.760]   You can buy that runs in a web browser. Yes, it works crazy from well Microsoft
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:19.480]   I don't know it Microsoft's office 365 is similar. It's a HTML5 version of their office suite
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:25.680]   Now just this is if you are not a serious office user and you just want to pull up a template and do a quick budget or make a
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.520]   Good newsletter anything that you can benefit from Apple's designed stuff
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.080]   Then it's it's highly useful. That's 90% of the people who use I work right?
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.920]   95 99 I mean if you're really doing serious spreadsheets for instance, you're not gonna use numbers
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   You use numbers because you want it to look pretty
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.240]   But you need your soccer team thing and you want your budget thing with a picture in it
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.840]   All that stuff right key note is still the only real standout above of the entire I work suite
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:55.280]   The pages is good if you want if you want to be able to publish ebooks
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.480]   But not really want to learn how to build ebooks
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:04.000]   It's certainly the closest thing to a wiziwig editor, but then again once I books author came up that kind of scotch that one too
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.740]   I had to use pages for a while because it was the only solution for native really good word processing on the
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.780]   iPad for a couple years and every single week. I felt the pain of using I using pages. Yeah
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:21.860]   Well, it's it's it's kind of an afterthought. It's not a big important thing for Apple
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.220]   But but it's nice that they finally have enough confidence
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.400]   It must be I don't mean this as a joke
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:32.580]   I mean that it must be nice for the team to finally be able to take the beta sticker off of those pages and have a sense that
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:38.740]   Yes, we if this project is completed we have finished this and how we can work on improvements if Apple decides if our company decides to give us more
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:39.940]   resources to
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.680]   They're really a lot of these divisions at Apple. They're really are like NASA
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.180]   Where they say we know we have a plan to land people on Mars
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.900]   All we need is for the people who budget us to let us do that
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:55.980]   But there's none but there's but they they want us to keep sending one or two people the ISS
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.900]   They still want us to send uncrewed probes and that's pretty much all they're gonna
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:03.100]   Let us do for a while take some of that Apple music money and give it to Eddie Q's
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:08.640]   They have added a 3d touch to the iOS versions
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:13.620]   And split for you for the iPad that's nice. I mean they're getting they're getting close to iPad Pro, right?
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.940]   They gotta they gotta yeah, let's pick up the place a little bit for the
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:23.220]   Also, this I think it's that place the same role as I worked it when the iPad first came out if there aren't really good
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:29.020]   Deep apps use those features right now Apple is the best standard bear for their own technology
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:35.140]   And if they can basically create the most productivity rich apps for an iPad Pro or even the iPad Air 2
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:42.620]   That support that also support 3d touch on their other technologies and also support force touch on the desktop
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.940]   That's gonna show the way of here's how good you can make this sort of stuff
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:49.140]   Here's here's how you mix these ingredients into your own products and make them better
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:54.800]   They've also added for both the web and iOS the ability to open pages
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:02.060]   06 and 08 numbers 06 or numbers 08 the older versions of the documents, which I frankly surprised they didn't have
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.620]   So yeah, I mean, I don't know if you're gonna write a
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:12.060]   Big report on your iPhone but the ability to open it's good. It's it's great for you
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:17.820]   It's great for editing. It's great for previewing the number of times where I have given a talk at a conference and
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:24.140]   Have been like in the back row running through my slides and making a couple of quick changes as ideas come to me
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:29.740]   Like an hour or two hours before I'm about to go on you don't use the iPhone for creativity use it for you
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:36.060]   Appreciate the fact you can create this new pocket experience that makes sense again in the back row at a conference when you were
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.300]   Suddenly realizing that you got someone's name wrong eight times during a slide deck whoops
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:45.540]   Let's fix that real quick and then you open it on the cloud and you can play it on your exactly
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:51.900]   It is also nice to see more 3d touch 3d touch. I think we could safely say now as is a success
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:57.660]   I see ever know is a great success has ever known has added it. We're starting to see more and more apps now
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.380]   Support 3d touch
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:04.820]   Twitter now has 3d touch and it's it's native client. I'm sure
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.860]   I'm sure the implementation in tweetbot is fantastic
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:12.220]   You know if you get a direct message haven't looked at yet the direct message is shown in the shortcut
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:16.140]   And then when you go there you can peek and pop it almost everything in the in the app
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:20.580]   It's it's really well done all the major steps seem to be adding it which is fantastic
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:25.140]   You know and tweet in tweetbot is one of the best demos you can possibly have because you in in Twitter
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:29.300]   You have tiny you have this tiny tiny scrolling text view that has things in a couple of lines
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.100]   Oftentimes it has rich content in there. That's maybe not relevant to you
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:38.100]   Right ability to just and it's not the stuff you want to be immersed in it's the stuff you want to check for a few seconds to look at that
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.260]   You know
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:43.940]   Kitty with kitty with a melon helmet on okay acknowledge. It's a kitty with a melon helmet on a door move on
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:48.860]   I
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.460]   Have to say I keep using going back to the Twitter main Twitter client
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:56.940]   Just cuz Twitter seems to add features that take a while to get to the third party the Twitter experience
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.100]   Twitter really wants to use
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.180]   Really wants you to use
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:06.220]   Their clients I think it's just so clutter I go to tweetbot because it's like an oasis from my eyes
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.980]   I know I know
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:13.220]   But but but feature wise I guess tweetbot does everything they have moments now not that moment the new activity of you too
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.900]   Which is kind of cool. Okay?
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:20.020]   Well, I paid for it. They did they just put out a new version. I think they did they just put up the
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:24.140]   The new version came out that had a few things but the up the they did a point one release
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:26.780]   They just added the 3d touch stuff recently. That's right. Okay
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:33.860]   So let me let me go get the new version of tweetbot you convinced me and they let you swipe away the Safari view controller
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.700]   Which some people were upset that you couldn't do originally?
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:38.940]   It's not the funny thing is it's not really a question of
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:43.260]   Whether I have it is more question of is it on the front page or is it in the folder?
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.540]   So and that's that's really that's the key isn't it?
[00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.860]   You know, we're talking actually this I thought this was quite interesting
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:56.260]   We were talking on Twitter this weekend at a great panel and I think it was a Peter Rojas who's now an investor at beta works
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.820]   Who pointed out that really?
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:05.060]   For a while it was the home screen that was the most important landscape, you know, you want to get your app on that icon grid on the front page
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:13.700]   Now it's notifications that really if you want if you as a app developer as a property of any kind
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.500]   You want to be in the notifications?
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.820]   I don't know if this is true so much on the iPhone because the notification screen
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:27.140]   Disappears so fast with the touch ID that maybe people don't see as much as they used to but that notification real estate is the most valuable real estate
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.220]   And that's true also of the watch right you really
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:35.820]   Brad Ellis formerly a Pacific helm said when he was one of the people who did the early designs for a lot of really well-known
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.740]   Apple watch apps and very early on he said, you know
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:43.420]   If you if you want to be on the Apple watch get your notification game type because that's gonna be more important
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.620]   A lot of things that you'll do in your app. I think that's true
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:53.020]   Yeah, it's absolutely it's particularly big with Android because you don't even have to interact with the phone for it to display a notification
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:51:00.580]   It's just becomes this low power low energy high utility sort of screen that keeps putting pushing stuff up there
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.900]   Well, that's nice. This is nice. So now I can force touch
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:10.420]   On the timeline I can force touch somebody's tweet and I get their their card
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:20.020]   I pad you again iPad interface as well. No does it. Oh nice. Yeah, all right. All right. You convinced me and you just whoops
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:26.500]   See this is always confusing. How do I get to the next page? Do I swipe? Oh, no, don't swipe because that'll do something else
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.140]   There you go. Yeah
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:34.820]   Cool, there's Renee Richie. I've heard of him pausing Star Wars trailer just long enough to do Mac break weekly
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:38.260]   How many times have you watched it? Oh probably 20
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.100]   You're reading the tea leaves. What are you doing with that?
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:47.020]   There's a bunch of people who are like like Saturday Caldwell and Matt Drans and a bunch of really smart people are finding Easter eggs in it
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.940]   Or have you straight little bits of information and I'm
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:56.220]   What's the most surprising? I think the thing that we were asking before the show which is where's Luke is one of the big questions, right?
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:52:01.380]   I don't want to spoil it for anybody who's trying to avoid the trailer though, but there's there's a lot of people trying to avoid the trailer
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.380]   They feel spoil the movie. Oh
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:12.620]   My god Andy and I was taking off his headphones in an amazing display of fortitude of Andy's spoiler fortitude
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.100]   Okay, we're not gonna talk about it people are fine like symbols and things so like
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:27.580]   So why is it you don't want to see the Star Wars trailer?
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:32.940]   You just you like to see it fresh Andy. Oh, he can't hear me do the headpad. Yeah, there you go
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:39.260]   Is it is it that you don't want that any anything you see it all was boy? I guess you're right, huh?
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.060]   It's just well
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:46.180]   It's just it's part of it is nostalgia because I did walk in to see the first Star Wars film when I was like six or seven years old
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:50.860]   Absolutely cool and also remember that even like when I was older of course
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:54.380]   I was all the trailers, but that was a day when they knew that
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:01.820]   They weren't they weren't so desperate and they wouldn't they would make sure that you don't find out who Luke Skywalker's father is in the trailer
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:07.860]   And so you know it went rest now. It's like you know, it's it's like even for the Martian
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:14.860]   It's like how much of the movie was still unspoiled by the end, you know, and so I just it's not like I'd be I'm gonna be
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:19.700]   Desperate about this. It's not as though I'm gonna be like walking in despite December and be walking through the streets going
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:23.700]   I can't hear you I can't hear you but just as an exercise
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:29.660]   I would love to see if I can go in there without seeing anything except for like the first teaser trailer that they came out
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.980]   Okay, because again, I don't think I don't think it'll ruin it for me
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:37.260]   But I think it would be exciting for me if I didn't find out that my god
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:41.580]   Mr. Spock is in the Star Wars universe now. I
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:45.180]   Like people on me about that myself
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:51.660]   What any spot is tied? Oh, yeah, he's he's joking
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:58.340]   Because it could happen no good now well it is it's the
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:06.420]   It's it's the rebooted Star Trek version of mr. Spock. It's not exactly Disney. So you got more to worry about Iron Man and Kermit
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.420]   Yeah, Kermit. I don't I don't want to see Kermit show up in Star Wars
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.580]   No, I agree with you in fact
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.100]   I've seen it is there's something about seeing something and you have no expectations and you're blown away
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:21.140]   I remember that's how I saw the Matrix I was a matinee and I hadn't I had no idea what that what it was about
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.660]   I just went in because I like the Wachowski's and I just went in and
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:26.140]   boom
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.940]   Well, you also have some people like Georgia when she sees a trailer
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.060]   She immediately knows what like this person must still be alive at that part of the movie
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:36.260]   Yeah, she's too smart and she starts figuring out the and I saw her five-year-old do that too
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.660]   So it must be an uncanny family thing. It's not she tries to point those things as well
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.820]   Yeah, I know it's not like trying to figure things out
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:46.780]   It's like there are times there's there's gonna be a lull in every movie and it's that lull in the third or fourth
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.820]   That okay, what shots from the trailer have I not seen I know I don't want I don't want that
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:56.580]   Sometimes you don't see him at all like where was Iron Man's great freefall and Iron Man - they just took that out and he's appalling
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.220]   It's appalling really
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:05.380]   Really appalling it they promised us a scene. They did not deliver Leo. That's just
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:13.460]   Were you surprised when you saw this I was app Intel has 1,000 people working on chips for the iPhone?
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:19.020]   Well, you read that when you read that title it implies that Apple's going to be moving to Intel
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.460]   Yeah, it's a horrible title. There was a story two years ago Anton
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:26.460]   I'm gonna pronounce his last name wrong in the tanko something I forgive me Anton
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:32.220]   But in a Russian newspaper where he was talking about this project where Intel you know Intel probably is never gonna get the chipset business
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.020]   They might get the fab business at some point
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:38.980]   But the modem business is still Qualcomm's that means it's up for grabs and if Intel can't make the processor
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:45.660]   Maybe they can make the mode they really would love to be in mobile because mobile's the future and Intel is totally dominant on desktop and laptop
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:50.340]   But if you're not in tablets and phones these days you kind of have a problem. They tried to scale
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:57.620]   Processors that didn't those didn't really catch on you do occasionally in tablets see Intel processors, but it's really an arm
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:03.220]   It's an arm. I'd love for them to fab in a 10 or an 11. I think that'd be fantastic. Yeah, but you know why not I mean
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:06.420]   It has to change their mindset
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.740]   Yeah, I guess
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:17.620]   Into an animator and tells using 14 nanometers, but they are Apple is interested according to our sources in
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:21.540]   an Intel 10 nanometer process
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.220]   Yep, and
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:28.700]   Of course if somebody's gonna do 10 nanometers first is probably Intel I would imagine
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:35.460]   So I mean there's a little moving to probably was hard for them. So yeah, I'll take there's some merit to this article
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.340]   But but don't get the implication that Apple's already done the deal is
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:41.740]   not true I
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:47.820]   mean, it's interesting to look at the the phones the Lumia phones that they introduced a few weeks ago that
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:55.240]   It's very very it's interesting that they've got liquid cooling on the CPU, but it's also interesting that every other
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.180]   mobile phone
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:01.380]   CPU manufacturer doesn't need liquid cool right yeah, yeah, hmm
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.300]   This should read Intel has 1000 people working on mobile chips
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.620]   period
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:13.100]   iPhone whatever Intel wants to get that business it's super interesting because you know 10 years ago if you'd said that Apple
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:17.420]   Was gonna be a leader in chipsets people would have laughed you know and rightly so but it's like this
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:21.420]   It's and I don't know if I told a story before but there's a story that it's very similar to Steve Jobs
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.860]   One of the best sushi and cafe max
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.180]   He just wanted the best people to help him pick chips
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.380]   And then once they had the best people they hired a bunch of people who AMD and other companies had laid off
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.660]   And then once he had those people and they bought PA semi and they bought in Trinity
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:37.020]   They did they had a plethora of talent and and Apple does not have to make money on the chips
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.140]   They don't have to sell them they don't have to keep them on the shelf for a long time to really get the profit out of that
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:46.420]   Design generation and they don't have to for example if you're Qualcomm and you're making a chip that's going in Windows phone
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:51.700]   And that's going in Android you have to support DirectX and OpenGL and you have to carry the burden of multiple platforms
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:55.820]   And there's all these things that Apple just doesn't have to put up with and they can just let these
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:58:00.500]   Amazing chip designers run as fast as they can and all of a sudden Apple is making
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:05.660]   Arguably the best R my P in the business and that's a really interesting position for a company like Apple to be in
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.540]   So funny I'm reading just that but go ahead not just that but
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:14.580]   Engineers in the in the CPU industry they want to work for Apple for much the main the same reasons that Renee has mentioned
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:20.260]   So it's not even case of hiring people away. It's a question of you are now the number one choice of the best talent is coming out there
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:27.580]   I'm reading the an article in computer world in 2008 when Apple bought PA semi and
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:30.460]   Apple shocks technology world
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:37.260]   Bice PA semi CPU designers now remember the iPhone was just out about a about a year
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:41.900]   When they did this but nobody contemplated that Apple would want to make chips
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:46.600]   In fact, you know this article is like well, what are they are just gonna be for the desktops?
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:52.900]   What are they talking about 64 bit and people made fun of them and you see all the benefits they've now everybody's doing it
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:53.860]   Yeah, yeah
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:59:00.980]   But it's all it's also the high level of integration one of the things that makes the iPad Pro so exciting is that I don't think that Apple's
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:04.780]   just blown and smoke when they talk about desktop level performance because maybe the
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:09.700]   Actual what you see actually there in the CPU is no great shakes
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:16.380]   But the way it's been designed to work specifically for this set of tasks tasks specifically with this architecture
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:22.220]   Specifically with this operating system and specifically with with apps that have been optimized to work with this OS and this architecture
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:27.460]   That's the way that it can get far far more horsepower than the engine block size would indicate
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:35.140]   Yeah, so I mean you could you could you could I've as a consumer I've been contemplating the difference between buying an Intel core m based
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.940]   Surface fuck for pro because they really are very nice tablets
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:47.780]   I'm actually suspecting that I'll get much better performance off of this mobile prop this mobile CPU in the iPad Pro for the iPad Pro
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:51.220]   This is a tough time for you Andy, isn't it?
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:55.380]   It's really I get time is expensive time. I love it
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:58.540]   I can't tell you I can't tell you how happy I am. I mean now now
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:01.940]   I've had the I've had this this loner for a couple days now
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:07.340]   And it's a really great phone and I love it and I would excuse me after based on two days talking about the six
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:13.420]   Not the next is a sorry the new X's and there's so many things about this that I really really like about it
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:18.260]   And there's so many things about the success plus that I really really like I love the fact that I don't know
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:23.220]   Which one I'm going to buy in a couple of months same thing with the iPad versus the surface
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:28.900]   Pro there to really superb tablets in their own individual ways
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.900]   It's not just everybody trying to make the same clone of the same hard words
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:37.580]   It's like everybody feels it seems as though the major players these days they feel
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:42.220]   Passionately about they have a passionate belief in this vision
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:47.860]   They've had of what a computer should look like and how what's gonna be most relevant to people in the next three to four to five years
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:52.420]   And it's I just love being in a position. We're so hard to choose
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:58.380]   Okay, but really the most important question are you gonna see Star Wars in 3d or 2d?
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:03.660]   Did you see the Dolby vision thing Leo no if you were trying to find out where it's playing in Dolby vision
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.620]   Which is the Dolby at most system plus a high dynamic range video on HDR
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:13.020]   But there's only seven HDR theaters in the entire country and at most is where your speakers come from above
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:18.060]   Yeah, see I don't care about 3d. I would like to see HDR though. Is there will there be an HDR?
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.020]   Of course there will I believe they said it's gonna be in Dolby vision in some places
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:26.980]   Yeah, I'm just I'm just there's no bigger Star Wars geek than I am
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:32.380]   But even I'm like I have a feeling they're gonna sell more than 5,000 tickets to this
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:39.580]   It's okay if I have to wait a week to actually just be able to like go to its theater of my choosing and see it
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:44.620]   You know, you're not have to sit in the first two rows. You're not gonna really try to see it the first night
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:50.580]   I'm if if I've got juiced in friends of mine who can get me into the absolute
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:54.860]   Awesome most awesome screening in the most awesome theater and George Lucas is there and he very much liked to me
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:02:01.820]   Hey, I'll go to that one you need to be a fan a fan bingo VIP you could do it. Yes. Yeah
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:06.380]   I mean, I'm not I'm not willing to spend more than more than cover price for for these tickets
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.380]   I can't believe you can buy tickets now
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:16.040]   Yeah, yeah, I mean I I was I was one of those people who were not just not just had to get the first ticket to the
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:22.860]   episode one I was in line at four or five in the morning months earlier to be at a theater to buy
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.580]   When that with the actual ticket ticket online
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:28.260]   Purchasing open because there was no fan dango back then I
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:33.500]   I'm a little bit older now wait a minute. There was no fan dango back then however. Did you survive?
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:39.540]   You had to go to the book Lisa was telling me this yeah, we had to go to the box office to
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.460]   the box office a box
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:50.420]   But I wanted to be with people who are also had my particular level of crazy about this I know it's like waiting in line for an
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.420]   Apple store exactly
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:58.020]   Was saying that they lot there was a huge monetization ability they could have charged nerds a dollar a shot to watch the trailer last night
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.460]   They would have made a fortune and total lost opportunity
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:06.620]   So I'm confused because this fan dango says it opens the 18th, but I could buy tickets on the 17th
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.380]   There's a midnight or late night showing on the
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.380]   Should do it. How many do we need?
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:18.060]   3d right all of them all the tickets
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:22.180]   Should I get this kid I get 10 20
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:25.980]   I'll get 20
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.340]   Everybody in the everybody in the brick house can do it
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:35.260]   What do you think do it all right? I would love to see this movie
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:41.380]   All right, seriously, I'm having a hard time concentrating with you guys talking about this move. Well, don't watch any more trailers
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:48.860]   It's just causing you a hyperventilate. I just thought of another reason why I should probably try to see it like the first day because if I
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:52.120]   Play three or four days worse than spoiler
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:57.300]   As reading everyone who's pissed off for stupid reasons thing
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:02.260]   Well, you know, I mean there's not enough thought fighting in this way. I was you know well
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:07.320]   I mean, it's also it's non canonical because the Marvel comic princess was supposed to be a god
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:15.940]   So I and by the way, I did just by 20 tickets for Thursday December 17th at 7 30 p.m
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:19.080]   Quit party. So I think we're all going
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:24.980]   3d I'm sorry. They didn't offer a 2d option
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.740]   Less than two. We don't mind 3d, right?
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:33.380]   I'm down. You're okay with that Jason. I'm okay with that bring it on. I don't care
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.380]   I want you to bring the whole family
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.780]   John will be going here comes Greg. He's obviously interested
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:45.580]   So I think we're there's some interest going on here. It's still it's still spinning complete my purchase is still spinning
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:48.500]   Perhaps perhaps they're going to reject
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:56.700]   There is no bad way to see type fighters flying through atmosphere. I think it might be good in 3d
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:00.120]   It's shot in 3d right. I mean, it's it's a native 3d. It's not a
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.820]   Simple oh
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:09.220]   Jammer be already bought some well, we'll have more jammer. Did you be John? Did you buy to the same event?
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:16.620]   Patrick Delahandy bought some it's not like you guys aren't going to want to watch this more than one time
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.700]   Yeah, but they bought them at the same time Patrick's way the a
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:24.180]   Place I'm convinced I think 20 tickets we if you know what if there's extras will invite our family
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.020]   People in the viewing audience
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:32.980]   What if you make it very clear to all the listeners that this is the one that you've already bought tickets for that if anybody
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:38.860]   Wants to be in the Twitter, Nanny by tickets this reading at this theater. I'm just right. Yeah, that's good
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:42.500]   It's right. It's at the Boulevard cinemas 12 in
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.540]   Petaluma, California Thursday December 17th 7 30 p.m

[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:03.300]   I was confused earlier. It was like a midnight showing is this right when it launches or the day
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.580]   But when does it launch actually the day before I don't know how we're getting how long it is?
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:15.260]   I don't get it, but I'm not gonna ask any questions. Although I know as the ball is still going it's still
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.180]   somewhat concerning but
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:23.020]   It might be my credit card information. I don't know how long it's been since I bought something on fan dango
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:27.380]   You're running an ad blocker. I am a son of a gun
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.620]   Yes, I'm a cheers
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:35.020]   It's disabled that okay. Yeah, that's probably what it is. He doesn't like the ad blocker
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:38.900]   This whole ad blocking thing what a mistake I made
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:42.340]   Let's take a break. Let's not let's unblock the ads
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:46.060]   Daddy's got to pay for some Star Wars tickets. Oh
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:51.980]   It's midnight internationally

[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.820]   I don't understand it
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:12.220]   Viewing starts Thursday the 17th at 7 p.m. Guy smiley saying our chatroom, which means we will see it only 30 minutes after everyone else does

[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:23.600]   I love legal zoom. We just started a new company Lisa started a new ad agency

[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:34.340]   And of course what do we do immediately we go to legal zoom?

[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.860]   trade marks
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:53.300]   Legal zoom the trademarks for twit and the twit logo last wheels living trusts

[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:07.340]   Navigate the legal system now. I have to explain this legal zoom is not a law firm, but that's the that's the benefit
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:12.820]   That's how they provide such great value. They don't rely on charging you by the hour you get transparent pricing
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:18.380]   You know exactly what's gonna cost you there's customer reviews. So you know exactly what you're getting up front
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:21.100]   They do and this is new
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:27.460]   And I love this if you do need legal advice what they did is they negotiated a deals with independent attorneys in almost every state
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:30.540]   So you can go for a flat for you again
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:35.660]   You know ahead of time what's gonna cost you get advice straight forward guidance and it's really a lot less than you would pay
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:40.580]   If you went out in the street and went to that big tall building downtown

[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:18.740]   I'm gonna assume that I got tickets and it's just spinning because it's you know
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:23.660]   That's what is other probably send you a confirmation email. I was just checking the email right now
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:29.620]   Okay moving on why are we I don't you know
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:33.460]   Well everybody knows that we are easily distracted, right?
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:36.860]   Sorry
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.460]   Moving on I either have or don't have tickets
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:51.700]   It's floating or tickets. It's floating your tickets. It's true if I if I check it. I maybe I won't maybe the cattle be dead
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.700]   I don't know I
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:58.940]   Just don't know what to do. What's okay? Yeah, you got all three you got the magic track new magic track
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:04.420]   Part new magic keyboard new magic mouse right right name. Yes. Is it is it dopey that you charge the mouse from the bottom
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.660]   Or does it even matter?
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.780]   No, so here
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.500]   Well, so here's the thing if you look at the magic trackpad for example
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.860]   Just because it's easy to hold up there has a nice flat surface at the back
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:18.780]   So it's very easy to mount a lightning port in it and it's very easy to use it while you're charging if we look at the magic
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:22.100]   Mouse there is no such surface at the back nor at the front
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.540]   So I did a mock-up
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.580]   I think I put it in the show notes
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:28.620]   I did a mock-up of what it would look like and it it would look sphincter esque if you actually put up
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:32.620]   Yeah, I don't think it belongs. I shouldn't be on it be like little yeah little mouse pellets be coming out the back
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:36.540]   It's not yeah, and you would you'd have to cut into the surface so your finger
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.680]   Yeah, where you're trying to use it your finger would feel it all the time that your
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.580]   That you're that you're it would basically be rubbing up against it all the time
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:47.820]   Apple could theoretically redesign the entire thing and make a flat back plane
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:52.580]   But when you use a mouse you want your hand to be pointing down to hold the mouse and a trackpad your hand is up
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.580]   So having something at the back doesn't mean anything but having it at the front
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:59.340]   It's just it's not ideal and yeah Apple could redesign it
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:05.660]   But it's something that you plug in once every month or so and for two minutes will give you a nine hour a day's worth of usage
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:09.860]   So in an ideal world. Yeah, it's not perfect that if you can't charge it while using it
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:16.300]   But for this design of the magic mouse is the best solution good. Yeah, I mean it looks stupid by charging
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:21.180]   But come on means not it's not like you're you have to leave it in there for three days while it charges
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.180]   That's a this is such a non-compliant
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.140]   Well, I either have 20 or 40
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:34.340]   I just decided to do it over again one of them completed one of them completed
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.060]   Auditorium one we will be there
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:45.220]   So and the trackpad I didn't realize it's who you showed a picture of it next to the old one
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.700]   It's a lot bigger. It's like twice. Yeah, it's 50% bigger
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:54.620]   33% I think I said and it's yeah, it's a big it is a big hunk of rectangular glass. Is that good?
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:01.260]   Yeah, I mean it's it's much better if you're using it for gestures and because you can do the force press and stuff now too
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:05.980]   I know Serenity said she doesn't like it as much because she's used to resting her fingers on the side of the trackpad
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.740]   I never did that so I didn't even notice the difference in size
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:12.900]   But it doesn't mean that you can move your fingers around without having to pick them up and replace them on the trackpad as much
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:16.500]   Yeah, and the thing is well, of course, you don't you won't know because of course
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.900]   It's gonna be months before you know how long the charge lasts probably
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:23.300]   Yeah, I did a couple quick tests
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:27.940]   I only had it for a week before I started writing about it and it went down and I was using it a lot
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:31.820]   I was switching especially the keyboard between multiple devices. It went down a few percentage points
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.740]   Okay, yeah, I don't think there'll be any problem
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:39.540]   Yeah, and I was usually apples incredibly conservative with their battery. So what you would do is you'd go to bed
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:44.620]   Well, this you see this is why I don't use wireless because it's unpredictable when it's gonna lose its juice
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.780]   Is there a gauge on screen that you can look at?
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:53.020]   Yeah, so you just go to the Bluetooth button on the Mac menu bar you tap on that and it shows you the amount of charge left
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:57.100]   But the thing is if it gives you a warning you still have about 20% left. Oh good. Okay
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.540]   You plug it in for two minutes
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:02.420]   It gives you nine hours of charge and all you got to do is tell Siri or something to remind you to plug it in at night
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:06.180]   And then it'll recharge for another month perfect. So I think that's fine
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:10.500]   Not that I want this mouse because I'm just not a fan of the magic mouse
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.500]   But it but I think that that's and as you point out putting it on the back is not a good idea
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:19.180]   And people like this is one of the few things like I generally like Apple products
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:24.900]   I think they're very considerate their design. I have not liked I like the original mouse on the Lisa and Mac because it was new and novel
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:29.740]   But I haven't liked an Apple mouse and send and like hockey puck didn't like the mighty mouse don't like the magic mouse, right?
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.900]   I'm not pretty supposed to like this, right?
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.860]   Somebody asked a good question is Apple gonna discontinue
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.500]   The any of the old keyboards
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.860]   I mean obviously they're gonna discontinue the mouse and trackpad
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:45.660]   But are they gonna discontinue because right now they have wired they have unwired they have full size
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:48.140]   They have I mean they're gonna keep those wired ones, right?
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:54.180]   The wired extended the wired extended keyboard is still on the price list
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:59.300]   I didn't see the old wireless keyboard on the price list or the wired compact keyboard on the price list, okay?
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.460]   I
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:05.540]   Guess we just don't know what Apple's gonna do, but they there's no way they're gonna kill the wired extended
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:09.300]   There's just too many things. That's what I use. It's to make people to use it
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:15.980]   Or unless unless of course they have a plan of making sure that all of the keyboards they make everywhere suck
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:20.460]   But again keyboards is standard a USB standard
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:28.220]   So you can buy a malware so yeah Apple has maybe has a little bit of license to make keyboards that really suck
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:32.540]   Oh, you got one
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:38.820]   Yeah, I mean now. What about the wedge design? Is that okay? Is that I mean this is
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.700]   I mean it's it depends on if I
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:47.100]   Used my desk for a lot of different things and sometimes you have to pick up your keyboard and move it someplace else
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:52.700]   And there's really no place to pick it up because there's no bezel on it the pitch of the angle
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:58.980]   Okay, I don't it's maybe a little bit flat for my taste the keys feel terrible. They're way too flat
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:05.380]   They're even worse than one my MacBook Pro and those were very good to begin with
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:13.260]   Honestly, I have my anchor keyboard that cost about a third as much and it's way more comfortable to type on than this is way more comfortable to use
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:22.180]   This is this is a desktop keyboard. That's it feels cheap to it's the this is embarrassing. Yeah
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:31.140]   Apple has launched what with the euphemistically call equality programs. Sorry guys. What what happened? Oh
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:35.620]   We hear him, but he seems to have lost his connectivity
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:43.860]   You hit me brought that keyboard down too hard. Oh, is the keyboard but that yeah, no no no it says for some reason
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:48.900]   Like for some reason you're on Wi-Fi on my MacBook and I know I've got you that I've plugged in it's working
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:54.640]   Did you did you get all of that or just yes? We got all of it. It was only when you put the keyboard down that something happened
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:16:00.700]   Yeah, I mean sorry guys is what we heard. Yes, because I'm because I'm sorry that my internet connection seems to be for
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:04.740]   It's fine, but yeah, I mean this is this is this is just bad
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:11.740]   It's it's it's interesting as a static object on your desk if your job is to have something pretty that you never have to type with
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:18.900]   Well done Apple nice design, but this is a desktop keyboard with absolutely not a single thing to recommend it whatsoever
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.300]   Except for it looks kind of interesting when you don't type on it
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:27.460]   It's interesting to me that there is such a divisiveness like with the MacBook keyboard and with this some people like
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:31.060]   I really like the Macbook keyboard and I really like this and the more I use it the more I like it
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.740]   But some people absolutely detest and you macbook keyboard and to test this keyboard is a very personal choice
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:38.060]   And it's not gonna get off his you know
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:41.980]   His apples extended keyboard to it's looking at anyone off one of those big clickety-clackie keyboards
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:47.260]   But even within the MacBook line some people I find it hard to go back to the MacBook Pro now because I'm used to the keys
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.140]   Not being as wobbly anymore. I actually like that but some people again. They really don't like it
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.260]   It takes a while
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.460]   It's taking me a while to get used to the MacBook and not and I still get typos
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:58.580]   For some reason just because of the way the keyboard is but
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:03.620]   Switching back and forth was hard for me because I had a MacBook Pro that I was using for editing video editing as well
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.180]   And I've moved that to my iMac now
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:07.380]   So I'm not switching back and forth and now it's much easier
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:11.860]   But that's one of the things that I wish this stuff was all more consistent like I like this new keyboard a lot
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:17.060]   I wish the keys were black and I wish they were backlit and I understand Apple can't do the backlight for now because it wouldn't have
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.180]   A month of battery anymore, but eventually they'll get there
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:21.100]   But I like the same token
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:26.700]   I don't necessarily like a giant swath of white on the top of this right and I know intellectually it's a glass and it's not gonna
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:30.460]   Stay but it just looks like this big, you know piece of paper that's gonna stay in on my desk
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:37.620]   Right, and why can't I have this in rose gold or gold or space gray or something rose gold. Oh, yeah everything Leo everything
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:45.820]   But my major objection is just that it's the same same thing that I object to why could Apple put the SD card slot on the way
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:48.420]   Way back of the iMac your idiots if you put it there
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:54.860]   It's like this is a desktop keyboard. You've made no allowances to make this a really really useful mobile keyboard
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:59.460]   Something that would be really really useful with an iPad is a desktop keyboard
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.460]   You're offering no
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:07.340]   Advantages whatsoever to this as a desktop keyboard. You could have made the most beautiful designed
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:14.180]   beautiful feeling keyboard in the world with function keys and up and down arrows aren't this tiny you could do that
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:21.300]   Nobody cares about making flat lightweight desktop keyboards except for Apple. Well, you know, this is what happens
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:27.540]   I think when you say designers have the final say because designers are just as opinionated as you guys and
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.100]   Their opinion apparently differs
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:33.860]   but they get to choose in Apple apparently, you know, and
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:39.740]   It's a design decision, but the least the good news is you don't have to use that keyboard
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:41.420]   And the philosophical thing is like for me
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:46.140]   There's a huge advantage to having a keyboard on my iMac that is almost identical to keyboard on my MacBook because I
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.940]   Think about typing that I do think about it
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:53.500]   Yeah, and maybe that's the lowest common denominator for many people and they prefer better on both
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:59.140]   But for me, it just it means I have no excess mental load. I just communized our typing and it feels just like my MacBook
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.820]   I don't even consider it anymore. Yeah
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:05.700]   Yeah, but then at least have a keyboard that's as good as the keyboard on the back on the MacBook
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:12.340]   I mean that the I have the extended to the extended USB core keyboard over there and was the exact same key switches on my
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:19.420]   Unibody MacBook Pro from three or four or five years ago, which is perfectly fine perfectly competent notebook keyboard
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:25.200]   Now they started making the keyboard flatter on the MacBook for no decent reason and they made the keyboard on this desktop keyboard
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.900]   Flatter for no decent reason again
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:33.260]   I just there this is this is way well in the what the hell is Apple thinking column?
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:38.780]   I know I know comes down to they have the power to do exactly the stuff that interests them
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:41.300]   They know that they are there that the
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:48.180]   Microsoft of all people care about comfortable full-sized usable keyboard so people can always buy
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:51.900]   There's so ugly Microsoft and other companies. They want to do that
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:58.620]   I'm just sad to say that they really just don't find they they really don't want to bring Apple design to something as
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:05.060]   Hands-on literally as a keyboard. I'm just sorry that they don't I love how Andy and I can disagree about stuff like this and do
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:09.380]   So amically and friendly and I feel happy listening to them have different opinions unlike a lot of the internet
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:12.580]   I think is a great credit to the show you so one of the questions
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:15.500]   Yes, because we're we're collegial and
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:23.100]   Deeks and we care never also well also the the the central fact of all discussions that you are never wrong when you say
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.420]   This is how this makes me feel yes
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:29.380]   It's when you say that you should you are wrong for feeling something different for me
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   So I if this keyboard disgusts me it doesn't quite discuss me, but it's just you know, I it's it's
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:40.700]   I'm gonna use it somewhere, but it's not gonna be it's not gonna be used as much as this simple
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:45.260]   proletarian and expensive much more comfortable no-name keyboard
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.260]   But again if you like it, that's fine
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.020]   Jesus
[01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:55.420]   Saying hey stop enjoying that you shouldn't be enjoying that
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:21:00.020]   By the way, I think I've had the same problem that you seem to be having right now
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:05.420]   And because in theory in the network preferences you can reorder
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.780]   the
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:12.980]   Wi-Fi and ethernet so that it prefer if if Wi-Fi is available, but you have ethernet plugged in it would prefer ethernet
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.700]   I would my IT guy told me last week
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:21.540]   You're using all you're the number one user of Wi-Fi on your desktop Mac in your office
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:28.180]   Don't you know you have ethernet available? I said I do he said yeah, he said did you know it's also plugged into your machine?
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:35.140]   I said it is he said yeah, and I even checked your network preference pain and ethernet's preferred
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:39.580]   But for some reason my I'm a has been using Wi-Fi for like the last four years
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:45.580]   Actually turned Wi-Fi off the show just looking that's what I that's what I had to do is turn off Wi-Fi on that machine
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:48.420]   I don't know what's going on because during the first commercial
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:54.140]   I did notice that for some reason was using Wi-Fi and so the ethernet had plugged in so I disconnected turned off Wi-Fi
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:57.220]   But for some reason at this in this instance
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:01.540]   My Mac book does not want to use the ethernet that I have connected
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:04.500]   Right now, it's not because it's not plugged in I
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:09.700]   Have showed just yeah, yeah, no, it's so strange because there is it you know
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.940]   And if you go to the network assistant preference pain
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:18.540]   There's a little drop down gear under the different connections and you can change the service order and you can indicate what you want it to be and
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:24.460]   And it should observe this all every computer I've ever used not just Apple does this
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:28.140]   But it seems maybe it's a bug in now capitan or something
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:31.860]   But it seems to be ignoring that the captain the captain seems to be ignoring
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:35.940]   But we what we Apple ignores what we think in every respect
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.180]   design
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:41.500]   So Jason Snell was curious he wanted to know if
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:47.540]   You could use these new track pads and so forth
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:51.020]   on older Macs
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:57.180]   So he plugged it in via light like the lightning charger and it worked even without Bluetooth
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.380]   So that's one good thing. You know you can use the cable
[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:08.420]   If you wish they work over USB without Bluetooth the magic trackpad apparently says requires El Capitan and Bluetooth 4.0
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:12.620]   However, he says
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:17.740]   When I plug the magic track back into the iMac nothing happened it didn't recognize it at all
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.740]   I couldn't pair it using Bluetooth either
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:25.980]   So it was running Yosemite. So that's true. You do need El Capitan and it did work
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:28.780]   Everything including force touch was supported over USB
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:33.380]   Then and this is the weird part I unplugged the trackpad and it still worked
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:37.580]   So a couple readers right in and say they had the same experience
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:41.100]   They plugged it into older Macs not expecting anything and it worked and they unplugged it and still work
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:46.740]   Apple doesn't officially say it's supported. So I don't know how well or how well maybe that's why because it's unpredictable
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.140]   Don't look a gift for forced clicking. Yeah
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:54.340]   And so he says all I can share my experiences. He doesn't have he says I don't have the labs
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:55.420]   I used to have at Mac row
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:59.900]   But all I could share my experiences with these two older Macs running older versions of OS 10
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:07.220]   My guess is some old Macs will support the magic trackpad to in some way the wired mode might be required
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:12.500]   But don't despair if you've got an older Mac and really want a magic trackpad to you should give it a try
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:17.220]   Apple may not claim compatibility, but it may work anyway
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:23.580]   Also, and thanks to our chat room for providing this link to us
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:27.980]   For a long time Windows users have been scammed
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:31.140]   by
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:36.420]   Swindlers this is Dan Gooden writing in ours technique a swindlers impersonating
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:39.300]   Microsoft saying well
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:42.540]   they say I'm calling from my windows and
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:48.380]   You I think we think you have we see you have malware on your system and walking him through this whole thing
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:53.260]   In fact the best recordings on YouTube of this are by people who own Macs, so they know it's not true
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.360]   And they still go through the whole thing
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:01.400]   Apparently malware bites has spotted a web campaign to do something similar on
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.980]   OS 10 and
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:08.580]   It gives you as connection failed and valid certificate call toll-free
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:16.580]   Critical security warning your device iPad iPod iPhone is infected with a malicious ad-ward attack
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:20.340]   It's always the giveaway when the English is not so perfect
[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:26.220]   Please contact tech support provide the error code root kits 1178
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:30.300]   To scan and remove any potential threats
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:35.340]   I just want to warn people who have been blithely ignorant of this scam on Windows side because you've owned max
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:38.300]   Now they're trying to get you this is not real
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:44.420]   Eventually you there's two ways you can lose this game one is they'll charge your credit card
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:49.620]   For the fix the quote fix which isn't of course there's nothing wrong in the first place
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:56.460]   So you may be out 300 bucks plus they've got your credit card number, but worse they often use remote access software to
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:02.100]   Fix the problem and in doing so embed other malware in your system
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:09.300]   So if you see something like this pop up, it's always in a browser. It's a it's a it's a it's just JavaScript just ignore it
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:12.580]   Turn it off
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:17.020]   And that's a shame that
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:22.700]   People have to put up with that stuff. It's mostly I'm sorry to say older people and
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:29.780]   Less sophisticated users anybody watching this shows not gonna get bit does your Macbook screen look like this
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.660]   Gosh, I hope not
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:38.620]   But apparently there are some people who have a Macbook pros or Mac books that are
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.740]   delaminating or
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:46.460]   their retina displays are are wearing their anti reflective coating is wearing off and
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:53.100]   Apple has created a quality program the euphemistically named quality program really means oh
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:27:00.100]   Yes, there is a problem and if you're affected we will fix it and even if you're out of warranty
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:04.220]   We will fix it. So if you do see your screen looking like that. Wow
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:10.220]   Now, you know Apple's been pretty good about this because I bet some of these areas could be from
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:15.500]   People using like Windex to clean their screen frat parties frat parties
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:22.460]   Don't use beer to clean your screen. Yeah, they're not slides people people are calling it stain like it
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:33.740]   A lot of people also put like screen cloths on their keyboard before they close the lid thinking that it will actually protect them from the keycaps
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:42.100]   So they might be it as well. Yeah, that actually has been a problem in the past on Apple laptops is the keys kind of leaving a greasy imprint on the screen
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:47.380]   Usually that can be cleaned off. Yeah, but this so I understand you saying well
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:51.220]   I don't want to but you're saying the cloth is worse than the keyboard key imprints
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:54.780]   Well, I'm I'm I'm I'm wondering if that isn't a factor as well
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:59.060]   If you've got if you've got a problem if you've got a problem paper. Yes
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:03.300]   Don't don't don't if you eat a lot of salty food
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:08.460]   So if you eat a lot of pretzels don't shake the pretzel salt over either keyboard before closing the lid stuff of that nature
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:15.140]   It's interesting saying that if if you've got a if Apple has a problem with the adhesion between the final coating in the glass
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:19.900]   So much that is subtle and it's not gonna affect everybody but in those
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:25.620]   Outsider cases where someone is putting a lot more pressure on that who knows maybe that's part of the problem, too
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:27.620]   It does it does shed a little bit light on
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:31.020]   coincidentally enough on
[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:36.460]   Microsoft's design for the surface book that people are it's interesting that there's a gap between the
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:41.060]   Rear edge of the hand never touch the screem of the top. Yeah
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:44.860]   Yeah, so and some and some people quite correctly are speculating
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:49.020]   Well, what happens if I have this my notebook and dust like migrate in between those two
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:56.740]   Versus the well, maybe it's better to not have the glass and they have any chance whatsoever it being ever in contact with the keycaps at all right, so
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:01.340]   Mine mine comes Monday. So by next week's
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:05.220]   Show, I will just I'll just kind of quickly show it and take it away
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:08.700]   Because it is Mac break weekly after all but just catnip
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:13.980]   Look this is but I think that that's an intro. I mean it kind of looks ugly
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:19.540]   Because it's looks like a clothes pin kind of when it closed this weird hinge closes
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:23.060]   But let me see if I can find an image of it
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:30.780]   But maybe that's what maybe that's you know one of the reasons you see that it doesn't it doesn't the keys never touch the screen because of that gap
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:34.860]   I'll let you know
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:37.260]   Looks like a nice notebook anyway
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:40.580]   Let's see what else
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:46.740]   Did I mention I bought 20 tickets for the Star Wars at least yeah at least maybe 40
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:50.020]   256 okay, this is a good one actually and
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:53.300]   I'm not sure exactly what's going on. There's an ad
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:56.100]   kit SDK
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:59.500]   That some apps use that apparently
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:04.100]   Pulls data from private APIs and is in fact
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:09.660]   sending back to companies your email address on your iPhone or
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:16.820]   iPad installed the list of installed app serial numbers and other information
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:22.660]   The company that discovered this source DNA said they found
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:32.220]   256 iOS apps that do this and of course it's a violation of the app store privacy policy, but apparently Apple didn't catch this
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:37.980]   The only one they mentioned by name is the Chinese McDonald's app
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:41.300]   Of course don't use that one
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:47.820]   And Apple says we're going to Apple says quote we've identified a group of apps
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:55.620]   That are using a third-party advertising SDK developed by you me and mobile advertising provider that uses private APIs
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:31:01.740]   To gather private information user email addresses and device identifiers and route data to its company server
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:09.460]   This is a violation of our security and privacy guidelines the apps using UME's SDK will be removed from the app store and
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:13.500]   Any new apps submitted to the app store using this SDK will be rejected
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:18.460]   We're closely working with developers to help them get updated versions of their apps that are safe for customers and
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:25.540]   In compliance with our guidelines back in the app store quickly that implies one that some people may have used this UME SDK and not known
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:27.700]   that it was doing this and
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.380]   Two which bothers me a little bit more. They're not giving out a list of these apps
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:36.500]   So you don't have any way of knowing whether you're affected
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:41.020]   And they're not using the kill switch. They're just taking them out of the app store. So
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:43.700]   What should we do about this?
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:50.220]   Well, the first thing the thing that always bothers me about this the same as Xcode Ghost is that it's it's levels of trust
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:55.020]   It's like SDK communicated diseases. It's not just who you're using it to that develop
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:32:01.140]   Like I buy from a developer, but does it developer outsource something to another company and do they outsource that to a freelancer?
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:05.580]   And do they go and get a library of things to use and how many steps?
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:09.980]   So how do I really know in the end who's producing the software that I'm using in this case?
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:17.220]   It's an advertising thing. So maybe the developers in their run - I understand monetization apps just monetizing apps is so hard and writing all the code to do
[01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:19.700]   The ad stuff. Yeah, you always go to third party for that. Yeah
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:25.500]   Yeah, it just means that now everyone has to pay a lot more like everyone from the developer and everywhere down that chain
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:28.060]   It's a lot more attention to where they're sourcing all this stuff from
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:35.180]   Yeah, should we worry? I mean some people are saying all this mostly Chinese apps. I guess you me is a Chinese ad
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:40.180]   Network, I don't know. You know the Swift on security account Leo on Twitter. Yeah Taylor Swift
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:41.060]   Yeah, so it's on security
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:48.780]   So if you want to run Android get an access if you want to run an iOS device do not jailbreak it and do not download software from China
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:55.940]   Yeah, this is the yumi web page and because it's in Chinese. I think it says make your ad around every corner
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:59.060]   Which I hope that's not a literal translation
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:05.560]   But this because of that I would presume that this is used only in iOS
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:11.180]   Chinese iOS apps, but one does not know I bet we're gonna see a lot more of this though
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:14.260]   Not only is a lot of development outsourced to other countries
[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:18.180]   But also I think that a lot of people a lot of companies are gonna be a little bit more desperate to
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:22.860]   Keep the money pipe flowing even when people are using ad blockers
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:28.860]   So we're gonna see I think we're gonna it's an opportunity for shenanigans for sure the thing that worries me is that
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:32.020]   I think Apple needs to be a little more forthcoming. We don't
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:36.320]   What are the apps? I want to be able I want to delete that app from my
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:39.980]   iPhone how do I do that? I don't know the list
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:45.580]   Why are they keeping that secret and last time for the Xcode ghost there was a list that wasn't provided by Apple
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:50.640]   But I one of the security companies put together list and I'm sure the security company here that discovered this has a list
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:56.060]   They say source tineses. We sent the list to Apple. Yeah, source DNA could publish that list too
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:34:02.220]   And maybe they should absolutely but the thing that's interesting is rich mogul did a really good piece for tidbits a few weeks ago
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:05.460]   We talked about how security is a lot of it is economics
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:08.340]   And if it's too expensive to attack a platform a lot of people can't do it
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:11.900]   And when you start attacking the developers it makes it much cheaper to go after iOS devices
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:19.660]   Getting a real malware app on the app store is very difficult getting it past Apple is very difficult getting into the developer chain is much less expensive and less difficult
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.660]   So that's sort of the new
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:25.540]   The new target area the new surface area for these attacks
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:30.220]   Yeah, and the other thing I guess we should probably say is
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:35.180]   It's not like I mean, it's not a huge violation of privacy
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:39.140]   It's your email, but you know any anybody who has a mom
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:42.900]   Has already had their email given out to a million
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:45.140]   You know
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:50.500]   greeting card companies and things like that, right? No, your email isn't the most private thing about you
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:55.700]   It's a little weird that it collects all the apps you use but again. I don't know if that's a huge
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:58.460]   Twitter was Twitter was doing that. Yeah, yeah
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:03.780]   And then they said and this is a benefit to you because now we're gonna give you tweets that are more you'll be more interested in because we now know
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:09.500]   What apps you use it's not like it's giving your as far as we know and nobody's implied this your credit card numbers
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.500]   or anything like that, right? It's just you're
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:17.940]   You had to be running older versions of iOS to get some of the information like nothing that I can't think about I guess, right?
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:22.900]   No, I mean any information leaked is information leaked and we never and in ideal world you want you want zero
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:28.740]   Zero knowledge you want anyone to know anything about you, but iOS is on a pretty good job of making where it's all about
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:30.260]   Defense of depth and mitigation
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.020]   So if you can get something on to the platform
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:33.980]   How do they make sure you get no further than that app?
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:37.580]   How do they make sure you get no further than the sandbox container that app can access?
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:43.900]   And there are still a few things that the app needs to be able to pull and but they're getting better generation after generation of tightening that down
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:44.900]   Yeah
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:45.900]   Yeah
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:51.260]   If anything it's just here to let us know that there's this problem exists and there are places where you can tighten down the screws a little bit more
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:36:04.460]   Delete that official Chinese McDonald's app right away apples. I don't know should I end it a sad note?
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:10.220]   Apple's biggest fan has passed away according to the Washington Post. Did you know this guy was Apple's biggest fan?
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:15.580]   His name is Gary Allen. It definitely would be in the on the short list. Yeah
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:19.220]   Pastway brain cancer at the age of 67
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:23.140]   He was a retired EMS dispatcher and
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:27.380]   He was upset would travel the world obsessively and
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:35.180]   Expensively says the watching it was to be among the first in line at a company's news stores. He attended more than 100 40 Apple store openings
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:38.900]   He could even tell you where the Apple store tables are made
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:43.380]   In Utah and he stopped by the factory wants to say thanks
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:49.460]   It was an outstanding website. What's the website info Apple store info?
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:52.580]   So it's everything you ever want to know about the Apple store. Yeah
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:58.420]   I think it also includes like if your city is being considered for a flagship store
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:03.440]   Then you'll have he would have pictures of the site
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:10.360]   Construction pictures have it going on this I learned more about the Boylston Street Apple store in Boston from his site than from the local news
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:17.620]   Even for my own career. Unfortunately, the site is down with just this simple note. Please come back later and I think you have to go to archive
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:22.220]   Internet archive to see yeah, it's I F O Apple store dot com right? Yeah, I
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:24.860]   What is that I F O?
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:27.580]   If I am a fan of I don't know
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:31.340]   So Gary Allen passed away and
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:39.420]   May he rest in peace. I had no idea he existed and I'm sorry. I missed his posts because they sound fascinating
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:45.900]   Terrific. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice to see passion without mania, you know, yes
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:51.940]   Well, you I mean a level of interest that clearly feeds somebody's enjoyment of life instead of dislodging
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:57.980]   Enjoyment of life travels great and he used to travel and if you want to go to Madrid to see the Apple store opening
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:37:59.860]   It's a hell. There's nothing wrong with that. That's great
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:05.660]   Exactly, and it's the it's the amount of clarity with which he shared his love of the Apple stores, right?
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:11.220]   That made it so valuable against some sometimes you see people that are just like you know, they're angry with themselves
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:15.140]   They're angry with themselves if they don't get to see Star Wars on the first day
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:21.860]   And we'll just eat at them for three or four years as opposed to the reasons why you would enjoy seeing Star Wars on the first day
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:28.820]   Here's an example of one of his tweets. This is the Madrid Apple store. He's noting that the same granite is
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:34.820]   Outside as is inside in the tiles and the complex wood window frame
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:39.620]   hides an ugly metal frame for sliding shutters, and you know, I have to say
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:45.700]   That's kind of cool, and it's neat that he would note these details and bring them to our attention
[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.780]   So I also like about this
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:49.500]   I also like to imagine
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:56.020]   Remember that every single part every single component of every single design of everything ever was the result of a lot of people
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:39:02.660]   Who worked very very hard on it and put a lot of thought into it, and I like to imagine someone inside Cupertino saying yes
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:08.380]   Somebody noticed that detail. I thought that I thought that was important and we all thought that was a great idea
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:11.620]   I'm glad that some and we didn't do this so someone would notice it
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:15.780]   But it pleases us that someone noticed that attention to detail. Yeah. Yeah, that's neat
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:23.540]   Let's take a break. We're gonna get you pics of the week in a moment, but first word about audible calm
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:28.180]   Boy, I'm you know everybody knows how much we love audible
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:29.980]   I don't even know if we have to do ads anymore
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:37.040]   We just say if you're not an audible subscriber what the heck why not surely you've heard us talk about the huge variety now
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:39.580]   thousand
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:40.980]   books
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:48.220]   and not just you know books but radio shows and lectures and comedy performances all sorts of audio performances
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:55.060]   If you want to keep up with what's going on audible is a great resource for that
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:40:00.620]   I listened to the Steve Jobs books on audible the Elon Musk book on audible
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:07.340]   I'm kind of a fan of the rock and roll bios, so I've I've learned everything you could possibly know about Graham Nash and Keith
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:13.960]   Richards and Eric Clapton and it's just fun to listen to these books. They just come alive
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.960]   Will Wheaton has a new one
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:24.340]   Randall Monroe the guy who does XKCD has a new book and will Wheaton narrates it cuz we're called what if and I just can't
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:29.280]   I'm dying to read this. I'm sorry people get mad when I say read listen to it
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:32.700]   What if serious scientific answers to absurd?
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:38.940]   hypothetical questions, I guess Randall Monroe gets a lot of strange questions from his fans and
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:46.260]   So he tried to answer them. What if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90% of the speed of light what would happen?
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:50.020]   How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live?
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:57.340]   If there were a robot apocalypse, how long would humanity last this sounds great?
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:05.540]   Yeah, he started off as a column actually and of course once he started doing the first one everyone keeps keeps coming up with interesting
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:13.340]   Questions that can be answered in depth and scientifically that almost always and with the answer of all energy in the universe collapses
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.340]   reality
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:20.260]   Like okay, well assume that you could actually carry here's the mass of a baseball
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:26.220]   Here's the amount of energy you'd have to put into that baseball to move it to the speed of light that consumes all energy in the universe
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:28.300]   Wow
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:36.180]   By the way as is often the case with audible books there because this book has pictures has you know images in it audible makes those
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:38.940]   They call it the company reference material available
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:42.140]   So you can download it as a PDF and look at it
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:47.740]   So I think that that's really great. You're not really you're not losing anything and you're gaining something you're gaining will
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:49.380]   We can in your ear
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:53.260]   So I love audible this could be your free book. We're gonna get you a free book
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:55.940]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:05.500]   But may I point out that I am not the only one who listens like a demon to audible and named Andy Anakos also quite the fan
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.860]   You said you just bought a couple of new books. What's new?
[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:15.060]   Just bought a couple of them Sarah vowel has a brand-new offer. Yeah about it's called Lafayette in the somewhat United States
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:18.060]   That I have not I haven't even started it yet
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:22.060]   But based on based on the word Sarah vowel I needed I have to I knew I had to get it
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:27.180]   It's basically a first-person account of the American Revolution
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:34.300]   Basically following around Lafayette that this teenage Frenchman who decided to come over here and stand you know
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:38.660]   buddy up to George Washington and start having adventures here and it really really
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:42.580]   Goes into here's here's what it might have been like to actually been
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:45.380]   been there as
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:52.100]   British as French and American troops are surrounding by the thousands as there's in fighting about what the direction should be as people are trying to
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:54.100]   unseat George Washington as the
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:56.820]   As the commander-in-chief of the continental forces
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:04.980]   It's it's and it's not by what I've read about it. It's not even a you everything that's been told to you about the United States history
[01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:07.900]   So you know I told by white men. It's like no
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:14.700]   It's actually it's actually a lot more interesting a lot funnier than you might then you might have imagined and and the idea of taking it through
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:18.660]   The eyes of Lafayette is is such an interesting thing
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:25.220]   I'm just been having just been through to David McCulloch books about the American both the American Revolution and
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:30.580]   Like France from like 1800 through 1890 through the eyes of Americans
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:34.420]   This seems like a really great final book in that trilogy and also Sarah vowel
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:37.300]   That's two words that means that I'm buying this book
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:44.940]   She's so great and by the way look who reads on this. It's not just her Fred Armisen Nick Offerman
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:48.140]   John Hodgman
[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:54.860]   John Slattery Patton Oswald. I mean this is a cast of some of the funniest best actors out there. I
[01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:57.500]   Can't wait
[01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:01.260]   And by the way, Sarah Val has such a great distinctive voice
[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:05.620]   You might have heard her on this American life. She's just let me play a little bit of this
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:12.260]   arrived in Philadelphia to revisit the building he referred to as the Hall of Independence
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:16.820]   20,000 locals gathered there to hear what he had to say
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:24.020]   Within these sacred walls by a council of wise and so this is a full what they call a full cast
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:28.180]   Reading which makes it so fun. Oh
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:34.460]   Andy this I get I get my credit in on the 22nd. This is it. I'm gonna put this on my
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:42.020]   That's that I've never considered canceling my subscription to honorable because it's just nice to say that
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:46.340]   I try to be careful about my money, but it's nice to know that well
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:51.900]   No, I already have like a book coming to me because it's already been paid for with my audible subscription now of all the
[01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:58.340]   Thousands and thousands of books. Which one do I want? Yeah, and so I'm a lot if you could buy books that way
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.700]   I would subscribe to that way, but you can't but you can do it for vulnerable and that's what I'm doing
[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:05.100]   Audible calm you can now listen by the way on the web site
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:07.780]   So that means on a Chromebook you can listen of course
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:11.500]   It's got a great app for iOS Android Windows phone Windows
[01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:15.300]   I think there's a Mac app, but you don't need a Mac app. It's just awesome
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:19.780]   Audible comm slash Mac break your first book is free when you go there right?
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:23.580]   Now and with the other thing is you books you keep forever
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:27.100]   So even if you cancel in the first 30 days you don't have to pay anything, but that book is gonna be yours
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:32.020]   I have now more than 400 books in my library. I've been an audible member since 2000 and
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:38.180]   That means I have this great audio bookshelf that I can listen to at any time. It's so fun
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:43.500]   Getting a little behind though. I've got the new Neil Stevenson seven Eves, and I really want to read that
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:51.460]   I've got what else oh, I'm in the middle of the three-body problem almost done with that then the sequel the dark forest
[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:58.340]   There's just so many great books some health books. I've been listening to one that just really transformed I think is my my
[01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:00.900]   thoughts about
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:07.620]   Living into this last third of my life. It's called younger next year highly recommended. I just go on and on and on
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:09.500]   audible
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.700]   Dot com slash Mac
[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:13.820]   break
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:16.920]   Get your first book free look at all these books so many good books
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:24.780]   All right time for picks we just got a book pick from Annie so let me get give you a chance Renee Richie to
[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:27.100]   Even the score. What's your pick?
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.740]   So you and I are big fans of the Hue light bulb
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:33.100]   Oh, yeah, and I just picked up the new home kit hub for the Hue light bulb
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:38.700]   So now I have complete series control over my the lights in my house and I might have a bit of a problem
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:40.940]   I'll show you there's this great app called home
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:47.260]   It's not an Apple app, but it's an app called home and it interfaces with home kit and it lets you have complete control over
[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:49.260]   All the home kit apps
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:55.020]   It's home kit accessories in your house and you can set up homes and rooms and scenes and I have I think
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:57.500]   13 or 14 lamps on this now
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:03.060]   But once you have them set up and took me about they walk you through the process of moving your old bridge lights off
[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:05.180]   Basically you plug both bridges in at the same time
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:10.740]   It scans one copies the information over to the other then you just connect the old one you go on with the new one
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:15.900]   Super simple and now so you will want to replace your old Hue bridge with this home kit bridge, right?
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.820]   Yeah for two reasons one because the new the home kit bridge is secure and one of the big the big things about home kit
[01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:26.580]   Is they wanted to make sure that it was absolutely logged down so that there's no point of infiltration on your home network
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:29.720]   But you can do things like hey Siri turn my lights red
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:31.720]   Oh
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:37.680]   That's pretty sweet a story turn my lights purple
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:42.560]   He has by the way seduced serenity called willing to doing this too
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.880]   She says I resisted the pull of Philips Hughes lights for so long and then they got a home kit bridge
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.080]   And it's so good. I can say hey Siri turn my lights white
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:57.520]   This is something I didn't say it properly, but hey Siri turn the lights down 50%
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.520]   Sorry
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:07.680]   See that's the one downside is that it doesn't work every time still and I hope frankly the server side team is working on that
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:12.560]   But I just what I walk through my house and I say turn the lights on in the bedroom turn the lights down 50% turn the lights off
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:15.120]   And my phone doesn't have to be with me anymore
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.120]   I don't have to think about light switches anymore
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.600]   And if it's the middle of the night I can say hey Siri turn on the bathroom lights and the bathroom lights just come on
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.640]   Oh, that's nice
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.480]   So it's and they changed colors you can set up scenes like Srenity has her saying our red alert
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:31.120]   And then everything goes red and she can say stand down and everything goes back to normal again
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:37.640]   My challenge at this point though is I also want to use it with my Amazon Echo and I don't think the home kit works with the echo
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:42.960]   Right no, they're different systems like they can work they can both works. I don't think there's anything stopping okay
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:48.280]   I'm both okay. Okay. Yeah, I think it's like Android Auto and CarPlay where if you plug an iPhone in CarPlay
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:54.280]   I'll work if you plug an Android phone in Android Auto will work the device itself is agnostic and that I think is really best
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.600]   Because you know some people really want open solutions to everything
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:01.800]   I do and it's sort of like vaulting versus direct X versus metal and that that doesn't really let you have stuff
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:06.880]   That's perfectly tuned to the hardware and I like this because Google's gonna have their version of this available soon too
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.360]   But it means that if if I have a bunch of Apple stuff
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.440]   I know it's locked down to all that stuff if I happen to get an Android thing
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:18.240]   I can use it on that it's just using Google's protocol instead and it can still give me a completely integrated experience
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:21.880]   I think that's the best of both worlds. What does crash the compound to do?
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.000]   That's what I see that's my favorite thing
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.680]   I just because they have these built-in season now where you can say like Siri goodnight and make sure all your doors are locked
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:31.960]   All your lights are off everything else is set for you to go to sleep at night
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:38.500]   But I always like that from the West Wing where they say you know crash the compound and everything just locks down and with with a home kit on
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:44.240]   iOS 9 you can say anything you want like when you say read alert everything could lock down if you want crash the compound
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:49.320]   All those things are great and you can also do triggers where if you walk in and your door knob goes
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:53.360]   And then the motion sensor goes it knows to turn on the coffee maker and start warming up the oven
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:56.240]   So it's starting to add all these layers of intelligence
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:01.040]   And it goes back to this when I first saw a series announced I wrote this article called contextual awakening
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:06.400]   Where we always had these nightmare streams of the future where artificially intelligent robots would you know come for us?
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:12.640]   But we're not getting that sort of artificial intelligence. We're getting this cleverness where my lights aren't really they're not alive
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:18.440]   But they can do things for me and because of Siri they understand the context of what I'm asking for their sequential
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:23.740]   Inferns and there's all these little tricks that make them that make them smart and make them do things that are helpful to me
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:26.480]   Without me worrying about them overthrowing me and taking over the house
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.760]   Until they get sentient and then you're in trouble
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:39.000]   It's just helpful like I can walk through like I can just say game game on and I'll turn the TV on
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.480]   I'll turn the lights to the right setting and I know Georgia has it all set up so that when she's watching walking dead
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.400]   It has different lights than when she's watching Game of Thrones. Oh, that's the best
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:50.640]   It's just it's just fun way like you make your environment suit your entertainment
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:56.320]   But you have to buy this specific home kit bridge they have different bridges, right?
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:01.720]   Yeah, so there's two they are I believe gonna do a discounted version of the bridge for people who already own it
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:05.680]   I am totally impatient so I bought a new starter kit because it was the only thing that was shipping immediately
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.760]   But you can do that the problem we have right now
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:13.720]   It's both a problem and a benefit so I just bought a new bridge and that means that all the existing lights
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:20.280]   I have work, but senator pointed out she has four bridges and in a tower right now because she has the Sonos bridge and the Hugh bridge
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:23.080]   And the Lutron bridge and another one. Yeah, yeah
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:27.120]   But eventually all of this is gonna go into devices like the Elgato devices
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.680]   They have all the logic needed to run them in the actual device
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:30.200]   Yeah
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:35.880]   That would mean if for example if I had 13 old light bulbs and I wanted them and and the technology was located in the light bulb
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:38.400]   I have to buy 13 more light bulbs that are much more expensive
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:41.960]   So ideally that's where it'll go eventually we won't need the hubs
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:45.840]   But for now the hubs are a really economical way of getting it started now
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:51.360]   The Hughes have a new bulb the $20 bulb called Lux is that just a lower wattage bulb?
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:55.000]   Yeah, they have a wide right they have one they're basically just white lights now
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.960]   You can control the intensity of the one that really but okay. Yeah, and and if you go to Hugh.com
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:03.600]   They have all sorts of specialty lights right Phillips meet you
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:06.440]   They have all sorts of specialty lights and things now as well
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:11.400]   And you can tell because the old bridge is round and the new bridge is a rounded rectangle
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:16.260]   So you can physically differentiate them. All right, but I really like it and I can't wait
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:20.120]   Yeah, that's the new one. I can't wait for more stuff color ambience starter kit
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:25.640]   Yeah, it's it's I can't wait for more stuff to just once you start using the stuff on Siri
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:26.520]   You don't have to use it
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:31.320]   It's a convenience unless you have accessibility needs and then being able to use Siri as a huge advantage, right?
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:36.480]   But just being able to just tell what what I want the house to do and because iOS 9 now
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:41.000]   Sinks with iCloud as long as you're using iCloud keychain you can do this remotely as well
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.680]   You don't even need an Apple TV as a hub anymore
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:46.560]   You're just using your iCloud kit and if you have visitors you can give them guest access
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.560]   So it's getting kind of robust now
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.200]   Cool
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.260]   Hugh and it's nerdy Leo. It's just nerdy awesome
[01:52:54.260 --> 01:53:00.480]   Well the nerdiest thing you said was having different lights for the walking dead and Game of Thrones that's nerdy
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:03.520]   That's dead. You know if you're watching the abyss you want it all blue if you're watching
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:05.640]   Yeah, I just want to tattooing sunrise. I mean
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:08.520]   Life's too short for me to be doing
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:13.080]   Andy and I go your pick of the week
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:17.000]   Quick pick where we talked about the suspect candy shell grip case
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:23.200]   Which so I'm gonna make that a pick because I again every time if I almost don't care what phone I have now
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:26.640]   So long as I have it on the can't I've had three different phones with the past three or four years
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:29.000]   They've all been in candy shell grip case. It's because they're so good
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:31.560]   But a tip
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:36.520]   I published something last week about counterfeit technology you can get on Amazon and eBay
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:43.240]   Just a tip to be really really careful whenever you're buying something particularly if it's a consumable like a battery or a memory card
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:50.640]   There is a lot of you if something's being sold as an official Olympus camera battery if your model a camera or an official
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.360]   Kensington or Kingston memory card. There's a lot of counterfeits out there
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:00.040]   So if the price if the price of one seller is a lot less than
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:05.260]   Then the actual list price. That's a warning sign if you're on Amazon and it's being sold
[01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:12.160]   Buy a seller that only sells like four different kinds of memory cards and stopping sold directly through Amazon be worried
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:19.000]   The only way to be really safe is to make sure that what you're buying is being sold by and through Amazon because they're a lot more strict
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.680]   About their own products than what they sell through other sellers
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:25.120]   The good news is that if you do get stuck with something that's counterfeit and you'll know it
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:29.280]   I wrote this column after realizing that one of my Olympus batteries
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:33.920]   But only last for about 40 pictures and usually would died absolutely the worst moment
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:38.980]   It's not until then that actually looked at it really closely said oh I have three Olympus batteries one of them has
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:43.380]   Conchitex instead of the instead of English on it and that's the one that doesn't ever work
[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:46.880]   The good news is that if you do buy counterfeit stuff through Amazon
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:49.920]   They have just tell us tell us you're not happy with it
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:53.920]   We will give you a refund and then it becomes our problem not yours if you buy stuff with eBay
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:58.800]   That's a lot to get your they will act more as an intermediary than as a hey
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:02.800]   It's our responsibility to make sure you don't get stuck with counterfeit stuff. So
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:06.400]   There is actually a lawsuit now between eBay
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.200]   Targeting eBay and PayPal
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:14.720]   Alleging that they are knowingly helping people to sell counterfeit merchandise to consumers
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.720]   And so that that was just filed a couple months ago
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:21.400]   So if you want to be really really safe go through Amazon and once again make sure you're buying stuff
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:27.400]   Sold by Amazon and like I said if you know that if you know that an apple an apple
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:36.360]   MacBook charger lists for $99 and it's being sold by these guys for $43. There's probably a reason for that. Mm-hmm
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:42.920]   Yeah, I find it very difficult sometimes to tell and there are I've had shenanigans pulled even stuff
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:50.440]   That's prime which means it comes from Amazon warehouses, but it's sold by somebody else and fulfilled by Amazon
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.080]   And even there you can have shenanigans. I got a well no
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:57.400]   So you gotta be really careful
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:59.280]   Fulfilled by Amazon means that again
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:04.480]   They didn't procure it there just simply acting as the shipper and a lot of these people also do work through Amazon prime
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:10.280]   Which you're looking for is item look for the legend that Amazon that the item is being sold by Amazon
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:16.040]   Amazon yeah, yeah, that's not a guarantee, but again, they're a lot more reliable
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:21.560]   And again the it's a big problem particularly with memory cards because it'll work for a while
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:26.400]   And then there you are at Disney World and the one memory card you brought now does not work anymore
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.440]   It took two days for the vacation photos with you
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:32.640]   So the good news is if you if it's sold by Amazon they really stand behind their stuff
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:39.080]   And I've never even as a matter of fact even if it was sold by even if they were only the shipper of it
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:43.840]   The fact that you bought it you from an Amazon account means it's our problem that yours that those matter of fact
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:49.600]   They credit your count immediately as soon as you file the report you just have X number of weeks to actually return the item
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:52.560]   But you get that money back immediately. I find them very good
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:55.080]   I'm very good
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:02.800]   Andy and I coach Chicago Sun times great to have you. Thank you always and blame Canada for that hat
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:07.160]   I mean, yeah the stupid socialist internet service that

[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:20.720]   You don't have Canadian colors you can with one Siri commands like, you know, sorry turn my lights red
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:28.080]   All you need is red and white, right? There you go. There's more of an orangey, but that's okay. Stand on guard for the elio
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:30.080]   That's pretty good. I gotta I gotta say that
