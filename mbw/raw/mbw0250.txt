[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.800]   Hi, everyone.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.440]   Welcome to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.160]   This is-- we are here after the Monday after keynote.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.280]   This is-- I'm going to start over again,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.880]   because I just-- can I start-- can you just do the editing?
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.480]   I love course you may.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.200]   I was a little distracted by a bunch of stuff going on.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.080]   I haven't done this where I haven't done the mix.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.080]   Well, you're-- we're going to fix camera one while you're--
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.560]   You just fix it.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.240]   We'll just go ahead and fix this here.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.720]   Yeah, so-- well, not enough headroom for Keith.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.640]   Sorry, I keep moving.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.160]   OK, no more moving.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.960]   Everybody stay where you are.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.320]   OK, Alex, whenever you're ready.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.640]   Hi, everyone.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.240]   Welcome back to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.640]   This is Alex, sitting in for Leo, who's down at E3.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.040]   And we are post keynote for WWDC.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.840]   And Steve was there just for a little bit.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.600]   But we are going to do some recap of--
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.760]   and get some added input over what we saw there.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.640]   Here with me in the studio, Keith Lang, from Skitch
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.400]   and also Prototypes.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.080]   Alex, it's great to be here.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.280]   It's nice to be back.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.280]   I know.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.600]   You're never here, and then you're here all the time.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.120]   It's great.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.640]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.040]   Just small people in this studio.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.280]   It's what the studio needs.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.400]   Just more and more people in the studio.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.040]   This place is getting-- it's just getting
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.560]   to a certain level of density where it's
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.920]   time to move to a new larger studio, which we're getting close to.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.840]   So--
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.360]   And joining us over Skype is Aaron Hillagas
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.960]   from Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.680]   Hey, Aaron.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.200]   Hey, Alex.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.280]   And I was actually there, you know?
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.760]   So you actually got the clean feed of the--
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.800]   I got the clean feed.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.960]   Actually, it wasn't like the moonland.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   It didn't really happen.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.920]   They just put out a feed, and we're all
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.440]   going to pretend like it happened.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.960]   Because your was probably ultra HD compared to ours, which
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.640]   was very highly compressed, sometimes not working stream.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.120]   So you may have more information than we do related to this.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.680]   So anyway, so let's do a rundown.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.040]   Of course, what Apple covered was Lion, iOS,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.520]   and the iCloud, of course, is something
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.600]   that we all knew was coming.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.520]   And what we're really looking for here
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.480]   is really we're going to go from the developer's perspective
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.480]   as to what we saw here.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.880]   Lion, of course, $29.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.080]   So Apple has gotten pretty darn aggressive about the pricing.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.240]   It seems like this has become the new standard.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.720]   I think so.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.760]   I mean, maybe there is some pressure with--
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.280]   I mean, everything's getting cheaper, right?
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.960]   On iOS, on Mac apps.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.720]   And now the OS is-- they've just decided,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.320]   you know, we don't need to make our money here.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.840]   We can make our money somewhere else.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.320]   And the thing to remember is that this is an iOS,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.480]   and it's available on all of the computers
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.200]   that you registered to.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.800]   I'm not sure what the limit is.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.680]   I've heard five.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.120]   I've never gone over five, so I don't know.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.600]   But with-- as with all the other apps in the store,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.000]   you're able to just simply reinstall these over and over
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.920]   and over again to the different applications that you have.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.640]   So really, it's-- if you have five computers,
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.840]   if you have a family of computers,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.400]   you're talking about $6 a computer to install this.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.960]   Aaron, do you think this seems like it's a good thing
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.680]   for developers because it kind of moves--
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.640]   it allows the entire user base to continue to move forward
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.280]   and not drag their feet?
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.200]   It definitely does.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.880]   I mean, as a developer, you always
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.560]   want to use the latest and greatest because it's so nifty.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.720]   But when people are reluctant to upgrade,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.040]   you often have to do backwards compatibility
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.920]   and make compromises just based on older machines.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.120]   One thing I'll be interested to see
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.400]   is what the more security conscious users do.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.160]   A lot of people do not actually have their max on the internet
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.760]   as a result of their security caution,
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.280]   mainly when we're talking about intelligence agencies
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.360]   and things like that.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.040]   But I don't know how they're going to be able to upgrade.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.160]   That's an interesting question.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.720]   I hadn't really thought of that.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.840]   But yeah, if you're not putting your computer ever
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.960]   on the internet, now I think that one of the things that--
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.840]   somewhere is in there-- is in many ways the Mac App Store
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.240]   is not necessarily for intelligence agencies,
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.800]   for the average consumer.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.960]   It's probably one of the more secure ways to add applications.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.760]   We've heard over the last week that we had malware that
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.400]   has been kind of moving around through the system.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.600]   If you decide, as a consumer, that you're only going to be
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   buying through the Mac App Store, of course,
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.480]   that stuff has been theoretically
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.080]   vetted to some degree by Apple.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.760]   So it's an interesting process in that kind of walled-in
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.520]   garden approach to the process.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.160]   So for $29, we're seeing a variety of things,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.240]   new touch gestures.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.600]   It seems that the mouse is out.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.360]   It seems like they're really kind of pushing that through.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.720]   Mission Control, which, of course,
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.520]   is kind of a mixture of spaces and exposé.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.440]   Photo Booth, which just has a bunch of funny semi-useless
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.720]   features that will keep my kids very busy for hours.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.120]   The Launchpad, which, of course, will allow you to pop--
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.720]   and we'll go back through some of these,
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.920]   but the Launchpad versions, which, of course,
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.760]   lets you finally save auto-saving and auto-saving inversions.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.640]   The Mac App Store, of course, AirDrop,
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.280]   which is your peer-to-peer file sharing.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.120]   So it allows you to share a lot of these things over Wi-Fi
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.960]   without a lot of setup and a new version of Mail, which
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.440]   has conversation views and a variety of things,
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.880]   and maybe it'll actually work.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.840]   So of all of these, Keith, what really stood out for you
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.000]   as far as the lion upgrades?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.720]   Well, I mean, the price, aside from the price--
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.520]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.200]   Well, I mean--
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.840]   Which works two ways, too.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.400]   I mean, it's like Aaron alluded to, basically,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.640]   as a consumer, it's great.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   But also as a developer of applications,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.440]   it means everybody upgrades.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.520]   You don't have to worry about people
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.560]   using the last thing, because everyone's gone and upgraded
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.800]   all their machines.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.360]   And that means you can just use all those latest APIs
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.160]   and technologies, whatever, in your app.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.680]   So that alone, I think, means that there's no longer--
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.760]   you can build apps that no longer have to feel that they
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.040]   have to rely on this a couple of generations old OS.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.200]   You can just say, we only support the latest stuff.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.680]   It's cheap.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.240]   Go get it.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.400]   Well, do you think this actually puts a lot of pressure
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   on the--
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.000]   when you're a large enterprise, something
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.320]   we were kind of talking about a little bit during the stream,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.680]   you're a large enterprise, and you have to install 50,
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.080]   or 100, or 1,000 of these.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.400]   That number has to start adding up.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.800]   You have to start-- I don't know how this rolls out
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.400]   to enterprise.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.960]   But it seems like the OS 10 is becoming so inexpensive
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.280]   that even if the computer is a little bit more expensive,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.720]   it's becoming almost a no-brainer to have OS 10 in a lot of ways.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.000]   Obviously, you have the general infrastructure
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.480]   of how you want to manage your system.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.120]   But it seems like a lot of those things are easier,
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.680]   especially for small business.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.400]   I think being able-- if you have a small business of five--
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.480]   --like a little computer.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.560]   It's very easy to kind of maintain all of these things.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.480]   Aaron, from a developer's perspective,
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.600]   where do you see the biggest upgrades to Lion?
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.520]   What do you think is going to make the biggest difference
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.720]   in your day-to-day programming?
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.040]   Oh, the new document architecture is really fascinating.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.360]   The autosave, the versions, and keeping track of deltas,
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.560]   it's a very nifty step forward for the whole idea
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.280]   of the document and the document changing over time.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.320]   I think that's going to have a huge effect on what we do.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.080]   Yeah, so really to kind of back that up
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.840]   is not only are a lot of these document things available.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.680]   And of course, what they were showing were numbers,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.360]   and pages, and so on and so forth.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.160]   But this is an API that's available to the developers.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.320]   I mean, that's what we're talking about,
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.120]   to some degree in WWDC.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.240]   And so you're going to be able to write things, write
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.160]   a lot of these capabilities.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.360]   Do you have to write the capabilities,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.400]   or is it just built into the file system?
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.240]   It's a little of both.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.040]   You do have to do some special stuff.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.760]   For example, there is now asynchronous writing.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.120]   So you need to be able to deal with the fact
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.880]   that your writing may be going on in a different thread
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.400]   from the user interface.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.280]   So you do have, as a programmer, keep track of it.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.200]   Well, and that's one of the questions that--
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.840]   when we looked at this, one of the questions that I had was,
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.080]   what happens if you've got two people on two different devices
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.120]   writing to the same file at the same time?
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.920]   This is a typical thing with Google Docs.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.760]   You'll open it up, and you'll have two different people
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.400]   editing, which usually kind of keeps track of it,
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.000]   and it shows you where different people are,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.840]   and what they're doing, and so on and so forth.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.720]   But it doesn't sound like this is that refined yet.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.400]   You're basically just saving to that cloud.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.960]   Do we see the possibility of mischief here, or problems?
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.520]   So there's actually two issues here.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.800]   So you're talking about Lion and its autosave mechanism.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.320]   And then iCloud, I wasn't really ready to talk about that yet.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:21.920]   So on Lion, it's not very much of a concurrent document support
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.600]   is not really there.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.920]   It's really just a step forward in the idea of saving
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.360]   and loading your files from the file system.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   Yeah, so it's not-- and it's not designed for many people
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:33.880]   to use.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.560]   It's designed for a person to have access to all their files
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.720]   across all their devices.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.040]   And they're assuming that there's only one of you.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.600]   Now, Keith, what showed up for you in these line upgrades
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.680]   that was the most interesting from your perspective?
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.720]   Beyond the price.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.480]   Beyond the price.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.440]   That-- the whole sinking thing, I mean, the whole--
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.520]   where they were leading to was this cloud service, which
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.120]   we'll get to.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.920]   But so many things touch in.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.280]   They've built support into the documents
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.160]   to be able to handle that intelligently.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.960]   Right.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:16.920]   To handle-- well, like airdrop, actually, is kind of related.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.680]   I quite like that idea that, I mean, just transferring
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.240]   a file between 2max is often much harder than it should be.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.160]   So that little feature where it makes it easy for you
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.760]   and another machine to just quickly do a peer-to-peer
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.260]   translate.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.280]   And this has been a big issue for me, actually,
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.800]   is being creating documents on my iPad
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.440]   or trying to get documents to my iPad.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.880]   OK, now I'm going to have to plug it in.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.800]   I'm going to have to transfer a file over.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.880]   And I have to figure out where to put it in iTunes.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.200]   And this has been kind of a constant issue that has, for me.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.080]   Because I have a--
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.760]   I really kind of gotten into the--
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.520]   I mean, I'm the prototypical client
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.520]   that this is going to fix a lot of problems for.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.280]   Because I have a couple of different laptops, an iPad,
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.360]   an iPhone.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.000]   And I'm kind of seamlessly trying
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.560]   to go back and forth between all of them
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.800]   all at the same time.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.720]   And there's a lot of road--
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.360]   there's a lot of wrecks that are going on
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.080]   as I try to figure all of this stuff out.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.640]   And this does seem to kind of tie a lot of those things back
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:16.960]   together.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.360]   Do you see this progression?
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.280]   It looks like when you look at the way
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.800]   the mission controls work and the way some of the apps
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.040]   are popping up, this does still look
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.600]   like this slow progression of line
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.480]   becoming more like iOS or almost becoming,
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.240]   going more and more in that direction.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.440]   Do we think that that trajectory is continuing?
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.600]   I mean, if you look at Mail, the new Mail application,
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.280]   it's the iPad Mail with a bit more functionality.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.680]   And I mean, they've got some really nice stuff
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.920]   where they're handling threading in a much prettier way
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.160]   so you can see your conversation being cut down.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   But I mean, obviously, like Steve Jobs said,
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.000]   one of the biggest problems--
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.600]   the pain points was everything's going fine
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.800]   and then people start to deal with the file system
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.360]   and then it gets a lot harder.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.240]   And so there's these things here.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.520]   They just say, well, let's remove those completely.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.680]   I mean, maybe functionality is going to go a little bit away.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.680]   But overall, the experience is going
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.280]   to be easier for most people.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.840]   And a lot of times, I've said this before on the show,
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.280]   is that I really view Apple as this 90/90 company,
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.800]   which is, well, 90% of the people need 90% of the time.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.480]   And that keeps it simple.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.920]   Because most of us want the same things in the core.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.440]   And then there's all these little extra things
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.960]   that we want to do.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.040]   Anne?
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.600]   Yeah, besides the gesture stuff, which is obviously
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.720]   coming straight from the ideas of the iPad,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.440]   the full screen applications, making it really promoting
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.680]   that as a standard feature of all Mac applications
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.680]   is going to make them look a lot more like iPad applications.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.680]   And so I'm still kind of surprised
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.280]   that we haven't seen this kind of merge.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.840]   I almost felt like we would see something
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.000]   where you could almost start running your iPad.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.440]   There's a lot of apps that I would have on my iPad
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.720]   that I would really like to run on my computer.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.680]   You know, that they're simple, and they're almost like widgets.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.480]   And they're things that I'd like to see on both,
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.560]   and we haven't seen that yet.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.040]   But well, speaking of the iPad, of course,
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.360]   there were a lot of upgrades to also to the iOS.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.240]   And we're going to get to those in just a second.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.680]   But we're going to take this minute
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.760]   to thank one of our sponsors is GoToMeeting.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.520]   Of course, GoToMeeting is the way it sits.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.320]   Today is when all of the stuff we're talking about here,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.040]   you know, is between our iPad and our iPhone
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.520]   and our computers, all of us are traveling everywhere.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.880]   You know, we're all over the place.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.840]   We have our companies are spread out all over the world.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.680]   Our clients are spread out all over the world.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.800]   Our students are spread out all over the world.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.480]   And GoToMeeting is a great way to kind of find some sanity,
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.600]   you know, and all of that.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.520]   So, you know, this is just one of those ways
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.880]   that you can, whether you want to streamline a communication,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.360]   you know, you can drastically, you're basically not,
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.680]   you don't need to have everyone fly in anymore.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.480]   You don't need, you know, it's great to have
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.880]   those face-to-face conversations,
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.880]   but at the speed of development that we need now,
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.160]   a lot of times we just need to do that a lot.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.240]   You know, it's just not going to,
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.720]   it doesn't work to try to sync up everybody's travel schedules.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.520]   You can hold as many meetings as you want with GoToMeeting.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.520]   You can do it on a Mac or a PC.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.720]   You can use it for, if you want to do product reviews,
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.040]   sales presentations, training sessions,
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.120]   you know, all of those things can be done right from your desk.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.520]   And so you don't need to, you know,
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.400]   you don't need to have something, you know,
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.720]   the phone calls, sometimes you don't have the screens,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.360]   and GoToMeeting manages all of that.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.120]   So you can get everybody onto the conversation,
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.320]   show them their screen, go through the presentations.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.560]   And I have to admit that I sit inside of GoToMeeting's
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.800]   in three or four times a week.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.040]   Either within our company, we do trainings
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.360]   through a larger version called GoTo seminar.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   We have tons of meetings with all of our clients,
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.440]   and they're initiating some of the GoToMeeting's
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.640]   we're initiating, it's pretty much the standard.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.160]   So if you're interested in taking advantage
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.560]   of GoToMeeting, definitely get your 30-day free trial.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.920]   So you can try it out for 30 days,
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.200]   and then after that you can decide if it works.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.880]   But go to meeting.com/macbreak,
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.360]   definitely check that out and see if it's something
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.160]   that you could use within your business.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.040]   But if you're having a lot of those meetings
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.320]   and you're trying to figure out how you're gonna get
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.640]   everybody to sync up and be able to share screens
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.720]   and talk about those things,
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.880]   this is really the easiest way to do it.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.160]   There's not a lot of installation,
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.640]   it's just you get these little reminders
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.720]   and it keeps track of it all,
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.040]   and it does all the things that you wish you could do,
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.680]   sending out all the reminders that I never do.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.320]   You just let them do it, let them do it in the cloud.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.640]   So anyway, go to meeting.com/macbreak
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.320]   for your free 30-day trial.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.960]   So thanks again for GoToMeeting.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.640]   So now let's talk about iOS.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.680]   We have, of course, they talked a little bit
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.680]   about the marketing numbers, over 200 million iOS devices.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   And in the first 14 months, they've sold 25 million iPads.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.200]   And so it is 14 billion apps downloaded,
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.360]   not million, but billion apps downloaded from the app store.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.520]   And they had a checkout, they said they paid out
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.240]   more than $2.5 billion.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.480]   They had a big check actually to show us
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.200]   that it was written out to developers.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.440]   And I just wanna know what companies call developers,
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.680]   how they got $2.5 billion.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.600]   So anyway, so developers have gotten a lot of money
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   and of course 130 million books have been downloaded.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.600]   And got a little bit of an outside sound there
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.200]   coming from Aaron, we'll see if we do.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.880]   Do you have a train going by?
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.720]   No?
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.600]   - I do, I have someone vacuuming outside my hotel room.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.640]   - Oh, how sweet, how sweet.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.160]   There's always something.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.160]   So anyway, so of course we got some of the marketing numbers
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.280]   there talking about it, but more importantly,
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   we have a lot of new features, notification center.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.400]   It really looks like they've vastly improved
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.320]   or completely rewritten notification.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.200]   Was this something that really stuck out for you Keith?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.320]   - Absolutely.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.600]   I think it's stuck out for everybody,
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   you have used an iPhone.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.480]   Notifications, especially if you look at the competition,
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.000]   how notifications, how seamless and elegant it was.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.840]   - Elsewhere.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.880]   - Yeah, well, you know how it could do more than
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.480]   one notification kind of thing.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.320]   - Right.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.840]   - I think they've come up with a nice solution.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.800]   It's hard to say what it would be like until you use it.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.720]   - Right.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.040]   - So now when you're in any application,
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.840]   when you get a notification, it shows up at the very top.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.560]   You'll see like a little, a little, there's no,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.400]   but when you click on that,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.760]   you're not getting just that notification,
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.200]   you're going to the notification center.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.760]   - Swipe down from the top of the screen.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.080]   I think how it works.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.320]   - If you tap the notification,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.360]   it actually takes you into that application
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.760]   and shows you what the notification was concerning.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.160]   Swiping down would actually bring out the whole list.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.400]   - Okay, so you can tap to get,
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.680]   just go straight to handle that one issue,
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.520]   and swiping down gives you the whole,
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.520]   the whole kitten kabooly.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.360]   - That's right.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.960]   - Kitten kabooly.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.640]   That's my new, I've decided that's what it, that's the new.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.480]   - That's the new hip turn.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.320]   - The new hip turn.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.640]   I've decided that today.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.560]   So also new stands, so now you can have background downloads,
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.760]   so you have magazines.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.000]   A lot of us have had trouble trying to organize
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.840]   all these magazines,
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.080]   'cause they're all coming as separate applications
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.120]   or separate pieces.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.480]   And I have like a whole little section
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.080]   when all the little magazines are there.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.400]   And so it does make sense that new stand
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.320]   is pulling those together.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.760]   Aaron, are you using a lot of magazines,
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.520]   or do you read a lot of magazines on your iPad?
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.440]   - I actually don't.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.840]   I read books on my iPad,
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.320]   but I don't tend to read magazines.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.920]   And maybe it's because they all came
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.320]   with separate applications.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.160]   - Right.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   Now I've had this odd experience
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.640]   where I stopped buying magazines
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.560]   because I wanted to use them on my iPad,
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.120]   but once I got onto my iPad, I didn't actually beat them.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.680]   So now I've, and I think this might,
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.680]   I don't know if I'm a sign of the times of this weird
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.000]   in between where I don't feel like I really
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.360]   wanna carry paper around anymore,
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.720]   but I also am finding that the format
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.200]   doesn't really work on the iPad.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.520]   As nearly, I mean, to me,
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.840]   the flow that has been really working is Flipboard.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.920]   Flipboard is probably my most used application on the iPad.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.760]   So every morning, you know, have my coffee
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.200]   and look at it, look at all the different pieces of things.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.520]   But a lot of the other ones that have a lot more,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.920]   complex interfaces haven't really gotten to.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.520]   Are you reading any magazines, Keith?
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.360]   - For me, just Flipboard really is, is.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.600]   - Yeah, it's, which is driving all these newspaper companies
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.440]   crazy that Flipboard is there, but it's,
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.240]   I mean, the experience is beautiful and new.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.680]   You know, it's not trying to emulate a bit of dead tree.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.440]   And, well, it's interesting, it doesn't have any,
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.760]   it doesn't have all the bells and whistles
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.600]   that we would expect.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.040]   In fact, it's a little inefficient in that whole like go to,
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.920]   you know, contents and then go hit it again
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.760]   to see the whole thing.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.760]   And of course they have to do all that
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.280]   to keep people to some degree happy
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.000]   about passing those page views back.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.800]   But, but I have to admit that that's, to me,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.920]   that's the most seamless and I'm not looking
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.760]   for the bells and whistles.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.520]   I'm not looking for the extra video that I thought I'd want.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.920]   You know, I just want some, this seamless thing
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.560]   where I can kind of flip through stuff.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.400]   Yeah, just getting to it.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.000]   - But I'm not clear on how,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.600]   I'm not clear on how publishers going
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.480]   to publish their magazines.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.800]   Right now there's no standard format for the data
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   because everyone has written their own reader.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.640]   What is the format of data gonna be?
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.440]   Are people going to give PDFs and then videos
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.800]   and then some sort of an XML document to tie them together?
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.040]   - Yeah, and that's-
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:42.880]   - Anyone know?
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.720]   - I have no idea.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.560]   I mean, I think that that's,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.360]   but I think that that's been a big failing on Apple's side
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.600]   is not building proper publishing tools for, you know,
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.280]   for the iOS.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.520]   You know, I think that that is something
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.560]   that it would make sense to either decide
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.880]   that something like a DVD studio pro or pages or,
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.680]   I mean like for instance, pages takes all that data.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.760]   You've got multimedia, you've got, you know,
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.560]   you can put movies and images and so on and so forth.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.440]   It seems like it would make sense to have templates
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.000]   that were built into pages that would let you build magazines
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.520]   for iOS, you know, the template that'll make everything work
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.800]   inside of that that'll automatically export it out
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.680]   as in some kind of application or some applet
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.760]   or whatever, however it's gonna pop it back out.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.320]   But it does seem like, you know, we've seen,
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.000]   everybody's doing it differently right now
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.600]   and I think that's the real challenge.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.360]   - If you look at the success of the hype application
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.960]   on the Mac App Store, right?
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.800]   - Right.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.400]   - Which lets you build basically flash type animation
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.480]   and the app itself is obviously designed at people
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.840]   who are familiar with flash and it's laid out
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.360]   in the same way and it's been hugely successful.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.520]   And you know, it outputs dynamic CSS, you know,
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.000]   HTML5, right stuff.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.120]   That seems to indicate just the demand
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.000]   that there is for better publishing like,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.160]   - Well, I think there'd be a huge,
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.920]   and I don't think it has to be complicated
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.040]   but yeah, something that's standard and wizzy wig
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.760]   that lets you just kind of throw stuff together
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.680]   that's going to be published.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.920]   I know that for us that would be a big deal.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.520]   As far as building training documents
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.280]   and all kinds of other pieces and support materials
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.760]   that are more than PDFs.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.000]   You know, there aren't just the PDF,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.560]   they're actually a living document
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.720]   that can kind of move forward.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.960]   So we'll see if that continues to move forward.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.200]   We also have updates to Twitter.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.360]   So Twitter now is like pretty much
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.800]   part of the operating system at this point.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.360]   You know, it's completely supported.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.440]   So it's a single sign-on.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.880]   So you sign-on at the phone level
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.520]   and then every document that needs a Twitter sign-on
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.240]   is getting access to that.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.920]   It seems like this was more,
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.040]   this is a big deal for Twitter.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.840]   I mean, I think that it's a good thing for Apple too
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.240]   but I think that more than anything else,
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.640]   I mean, this is a huge win for Twitter
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.920]   because I mean, this is making it really just part
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.520]   of the iPhone at this point.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.120]   Aaron, do you see, does Apple get more out of it
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.000]   than it seems?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.040]   - Well, it seems that what Apple did is they went
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.360]   and they looked at a lot of the popular applications
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.240]   that were being used by lots and lots of people and said,
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.360]   what can we integrate into the operating system?
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.720]   So it's right there.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.160]   And the idea of being able to post photos to Twitter,
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.080]   I mean, there were a bunch of apps that did that
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.720]   or you look at something like Instapaper
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.040]   when they added their reader to Safari.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.480]   They were really looking for general purpose applications
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.440]   that had become really popular
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.960]   and then were adding them to the operating system.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.600]   And as a developer, one thing you have to ask yourself then
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.680]   is should I take the time to solve a general problem
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.240]   if immediately after it becomes profitable,
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.480]   Apple's gonna turn around and write the same thing
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.600]   and integrate it in with the operating system.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.680]   - Well, yeah, we saw this not only with this,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.360]   but with the other things we're talking about,
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.440]   Safari, of course, has tabbed interfaces now.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.480]   That's great.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.880]   But we saw it with reminders and camera.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.960]   There was a lot, there's a lot of applications out there
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.280]   that do reminders.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.040]   - You can get the audience just going, ooh.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.360]   I think those are the two that I really saw
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.200]   where it felt like Apple just dug into the developer.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.960]   But I don't know if this is the place to really show those.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.040]   So these are all, that's got, Aaron, would you say that
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.840]   those are the two that probably scared the developers
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.800]   the most, they really dug into--
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.160]   - I saw developers leaving the hall both clapping
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.600]   and tears streaming down their face at the same time.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.520]   - Yeah, it was, I mean, when you look at those,
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.920]   so there's all these different reminders.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.960]   And the problem is that even though that they are
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.720]   very individual and very powerful
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.160]   and do different things than what Apple's does,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.920]   the challenge that you always have to get into
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.160]   is that if Apple's is good enough,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.880]   people won't use anything else.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.520]   You know, just because it's all integrated into the system.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.000]   - Yes, that integration is like their notifications.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.480]   When I'm at the store, show me my shopping list.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.320]   - Right.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.120]   - You know, that kind of deep seated integration
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.360]   is I think probably hard to compete with.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.200]   - Right, yeah.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.560]   So I think that that's the real issue there.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.000]   The camera had a big, I mean, so the reminders
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.120]   were really interesting.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.440]   You know, we'll see how they worked.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.840]   Camera, of course, fixed many, I think,
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.160]   of the problems that a lot of people have had with camera.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.680]   Number one is it felt like you could go get a coffee
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.920]   in Afghanistan before it opened.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.480]   You know, you'd hit the, hit the, okay,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.160]   I'm ready to, you know, and something's happening
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.040]   and I wanna take a photo and then you're like,
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.480]   just and I'm kind of known, my wife knows
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.440]   that I'm about to take a photo
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.800]   'cause she sees me shaking my iPhone
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.480]   like it's gonna make it go any faster, but I hit it
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.520]   and I'm like, come on, come on.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.840]   My son's doing something really cute
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.200]   and by the time it gets to it, it's no longer there.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.680]   You know, it's gone.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.640]   And so now they've worked very hard.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.920]   I think a lot of that has to do,
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.440]   that slow startup was it grabbing the photo library.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.040]   You know, so the larger your library is
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.920]   and I have to admit, the reason mine takes a long time
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.440]   is that I don't think I've deleted anything
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.160]   since I had my first iPhone and I think it's just slowly
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.040]   passed on, it's like my visual document system.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.280]   And so it takes a long time to open,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   but by not doing that immediately
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.600]   or not looking at that immediately,
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.560]   it is much faster to open.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.480]   You can now use of all things, the volume button.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.080]   - Hurrah. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:07.920]   (laughing)
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.880]   So I know all the folks at Camera Plus
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.000]   are just going, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.520]   you know, so you can now use the volume button
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.920]   to take pictures, which just makes so much more sense
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.800]   when you're trying to trigger your camera.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.960]   - Or when you're trying to hand your camera
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.400]   to somebody else and they've never used an iPhone camera
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.040]   and you're like, you need to touch this little thing on,
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.040]   no, not there, not there, yeah.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.040]   - Yeah, and it's just, it's easier to take that photo
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.560]   by having it and by not sitting there,
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.960]   tapping the front of the screen
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.120]   to actually put that together.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.680]   Photo editing built into the camera.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.320]   Again, a lot of these things are things
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.640]   that a lot of other camera software was doing.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.800]   Now, to be fair, I think a lot of these camera folks,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.280]   if they've made, if they put it out,
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.000]   not in the last month, but earlier on,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.640]   if they had a solid application,
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.680]   I think most of them made a profit.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.600]   I mean, you know, it's not like they're losing money
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.240]   on the thing, but it is, it is.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.000]   And as a developer, I know that I've always,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.200]   you know, we develop some apps for the Mac
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.680]   and I know that we always look at every upgrade
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   to Final Cut or Motion as this might be
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.200]   the end of our software.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.120]   (laughs)
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.320]   - But it might be the start of something new.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.960]   - Oh, and you know, we're looking for the new features
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.320]   that we can possibly take advantage of
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.160]   and so on and so forth.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.400]   So, but, you know, I think that that is the danger
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.800]   is that Apple is active.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.040]   You know, this is the difference
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.920]   and Apple is actively developing software
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   and trying to make things easier.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.880]   - Yeah, we're talking about how the developers
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.800]   are crying on the way out of the hall.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.880]   I think that for the telecoms,
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.000]   iMessage was the moment where they started
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.040]   getting a little weepy.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.880]   - Yes.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.720]   - Yes.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.680]   - So, the big division when you were talking about
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.760]   the difference between your Mac and your iPhone
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.480]   is that the iPhone has SMS but no iChat
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.440]   and your computer has iChat but no SMS.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.200]   And so, by creating iMessage,
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.520]   they sort of took the telecoms out of the whole thing.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.680]   - No, it's charging a lot for those SMSs.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.800]   That's a big profit center for the telecoms.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.240]   - Well, and here's the question.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.080]   Is the,
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.560]   can you, is there a way for you to do this to the computer?
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.720]   It seemed like they were talking about all iOS device
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.280]   to iOS device.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.760]   I didn't see a way to do iMessages to,
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.760]   they didn't seem to show it going to a desktop computer.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.480]   - They didn't show it but I think it was implied
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.320]   by one of the slides.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.720]   I'll have to go back and look again.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.960]   - Okay, yeah, so, 'cause that is the big thing
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.840]   is being able to tie that in.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.040]   And not only that, that's a big lock, you know what I mean?
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   'Cause I know I spent a lot of time sending messages out
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.200]   and probably 80% of the people that I know
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.520]   that I'm sending messages to are on an iPhone.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.560]   So I think that, yeah, definitely,
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.160]   this seems to lock people in like you want everybody,
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.400]   you want everybody to have an iPhone
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.320]   so you can do the iMessaging.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.520]   You know, the big thing is being able to send the video
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.240]   and photos and so on and so forth.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.160]   That's a big deal when you're talking about,
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.600]   you know, no matter how big that data is.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.560]   I mean, we're getting our five gigs per month,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.640]   you know, for most, you know, on my iPhone I have unlimited
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.400]   or whatever, but I'm paying, you know,
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.760]   even in the US, you're paying whatever, $1.29 or $1.19 per MMS.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.640]   You know, if you want to send,
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.280]   if you're a text message to someone a picture,
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.600]   it's costing real money.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.280]   - Yeah, I mean, and in Australia, for example,
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.800]   it's, we don't have the same history
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.000]   of just unlimited data.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.880]   And so this kind of thing, it's, you know,
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.920]   approach carefully if your iPhone starts synchronizing
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.760]   gigabytes and gigabytes might be a surprise.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.160]   - Well, and I think that a lot of the synchronization
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.840]   it looks like is going through mostly Wi-Fi.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.040]   So the iMessage is going through, I think 3G and Wi-Fi,
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.440]   but I think that most of the syncing
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.960]   that they're talking about, which we'll talk about in a second,
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.720]   I think is mostly going through, mostly designed for Wi-Fi.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.720]   We skipped over, of course, the upgrades to mail,
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.280]   better search, which is painfully needed.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.360]   The search in mail right now is horrible.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.680]   The swipe to inbox, rich text formatting,
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.520]   which means absolutely, in the iOS, which is fine.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.040]   I don't really, do you use it?
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.800]   I don't really care if it has,
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.280]   I don't even like rich text.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.280]   - No, no, I'm not.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   - Yeah, just indents, flagging, S-MIME,
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.720]   which is really useful if you're in a large organization
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.760]   that once encrypted files.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.560]   What did you think, Aaron, what did you think
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.440]   of the split keyboard?
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.120]   So Apple is now kind of moved,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.640]   so people want to type with their thumbs.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   They've gotten away that you can kind of grab onto your iPad
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.080]   and be able to have two different keyboards on either side.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.800]   What do you think of that?
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.400]   - I thought it looked great.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.600]   I thought I would have it slid up
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.320]   and when it would be where your thumbs are,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.200]   it would slip apart.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.320]   It was pretty neat.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.080]   I don't typically type that way,
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.000]   but I could see if you were coming from a blackberry
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.280]   or something where you were more of a thumb typist,
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.360]   it might be comforting.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.200]   - I couldn't imagine actually using it that way,
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.040]   but I'd be very interesting.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.600]   I've found that one thing that's kind of surprised me
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.120]   is that my number one, I was looking at all my mail
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.960]   that goes by and I realized that my number one way
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.600]   of sending emails and receiving is my iPhone
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.680]   and I'm still using just one index finger.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.480]   Just kind of really, really fast.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.000]   - I saw the first use of two thumbs on an iPad.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.560]   - In the wild, yesterday.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.520]   It's a Ken from Omni actually,
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.600]   at a party last night and he's demoing something to me
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.880]   and he pulls it out and he's got the two thumbs
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.480]   and he's typing about as fast as I can type
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.880]   on a normal keyboard.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.160]   So it's doable, but apparently it just--
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.000]   - It just takes a little practice.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.960]   - Yeah, maybe this tweak will make it up.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.520]   - And really long thumbs.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.320]   - Ken must have really long.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.160]   We don't know.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.000]   - Yeah, I did not.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.840]   - You did a measure.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.680]   (laughing)
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.680]   - So also it is, we are truly moving to a post PC platform.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.640]   We now have over the air syncing.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.640]   So as far as upgrades and moving all the software updates
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.280]   and so on and Delta's.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.080]   So it means that it's not going to try to put
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   an entirely new OS every single time it runs over the air.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.600]   It will simply just add the things that have changed.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.560]   So I think that's a big move forward.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.880]   One thing that they mentioned really, really fast
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.640]   that I jumped onto immediately is they're like,
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.920]   and then you can do all the stuff and oh by the way,
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.880]   and they're like listing off all the, excuse me.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.320]   Sorry about that.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:30.320]   They were talking about the airplane mirroring.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.640]   So it was like one of the things like,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.880]   oh, and then we have all these other features
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.680]   and they're like making this list and they were like,
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.840]   and now you can mirror it via wifi
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.440]   and huge cheers from the audience.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.560]   - Well, and I was just like,
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.380]   (sighing)
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.520]   and I couldn't believe that that wasn't one of the big,
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.520]   and I guess that they didn't view that as a big upgrade.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.920]   But for many of us who are trying to use this
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.560]   in a classroom environment, use it in a recording environment,
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.520]   to record the iPad and everything else,
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.040]   dealing with all those cables
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.640]   and trying to make all of that work.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.160]   Now, we're assuming that that's going through air,
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.480]   that's going to your Apple TV,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.600]   but it means that you could theoretically hook your Apple TV
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   up to, and be able to now just have your iPad
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.800]   and see the full mirror.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.760]   And I think this is more of an e-learning solution
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.040]   than anything else.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.000]   - It's pretty slick.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.880]   I mean, I think that starts to open up a whole bunch
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.960]   of other possibilities for building apps too,
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.640]   and when you can walk around and have your little controller
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.680]   with you and start to put anything up on that big screen.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:36.680]   It's, yeah, it's, where's my jet pack kind of stuff?
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:40.120]   - Yeah, well, I mean, think about Sketchbook
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.200]   and being able to airplay that to the, you know,
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.600]   very seamlessly, sit there and wanna draw on this,
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.880]   you know, and everyone can draw and talk about things
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.320]   and when you think about a meeting before you're sitting there
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.960]   like, do we have the right connector
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.600]   and is this gonna sink correctly or whatever?
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.360]   But now you can imagine having a presentation,
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.000]   you know, a meeting with about, you know,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.680]   with five or 10 people in a conference room
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.560]   and you have one airport and you could theoretically be able
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.480]   to kind of, you know, push stuff up, I guess,
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.320]   it depends on how many apps, everyone would have to be
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.000]   kind of signed into that, but you could have a couple
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.440]   of different people sitting there showing off
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.080]   whatever they wanna show off in a presentation.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.480]   So it's very, very interesting.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.280]   - Well, for us, it's a lot of times we're showing off
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.840]   applications to people we're writing them for
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.160]   and often you need to get really close
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.320]   and pretty soon when you have the vice president
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.000]   and some company sitting on your laps
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.320]   that you can both use the iPad together,
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.240]   it's not the best sales situation.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.200]   - Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.640]   So I also think that there's an opportunity
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.520]   when you're thinking about, you know,
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.480]   if you're taking that, going out to the Apple TV
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.360]   and then taking the HDMI out of the Apple TV
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.000]   and let's say converting it, you know,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.480]   putting it into your computer, you know, like,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.200]   you know, so that you could stream it.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.840]   You theoretically with an iPad now have a wireless camera.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.800]   - This is true.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.680]   - 'Cause you could be sharing theoretically the video
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.880]   that the iPad is seeing and streaming that live
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.840]   without any tethering.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.880]   - There's a great video called, I'm trying to remember
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.760]   what it was called exactly, I think it was Firestorm.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.040]   I think the chat room might need to help me out on this one,
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.960]   but it was early, I think it was the Sun Microsystems.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.400]   Maybe Aaron, you might remember this one,
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.960]   but Bruce Tognesini kind of,
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.600]   it was done in the late '80s, if I remember,
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.880]   and they kind of imagined what the future
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.920]   of computing would be like.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.120]   And I distinctly remember one scene
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.400]   where they had a lady trying to show some camera shots
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.080]   to the guys out in the field.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.200]   And she was holding up basically an iPad
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.040]   and panning around, and that was controlling the camera
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.800]   and the view kind of thing.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.480]   You know, almost the same size concept.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.200]   It's kind of, there's all these things are coming true.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.280]   It's really amazing to me.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.520]   - Slowly. - Slowly.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.440]   - Slowly, but surely.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.120]   Yeah, so it's a very interesting,
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.080]   that mirroring I think will be pretty interesting.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.880]   And then also Wi-Fi, of course, sync to iTunes.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.920]   And so those were the, you know,
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.760]   some of the big upgrades.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.400]   And you know, all of the stuff, you know,
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.200]   none of it I felt like, you know,
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.600]   and I think that this was,
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.200]   you didn't see Steve up there.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.080]   I think part of the reason is that
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.680]   obviously Apple wants to build up other people
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.840]   to show that it's not just a Steve show.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.720]   But I think also, these are all evolutionary things.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.280]   They're all nifty.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.080]   They're all gonna improve our, you know,
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.680]   experiences Mac users and developers.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.240]   But they, you know, weren't the revolutionary things.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.760]   And I don't even know if iCloud could be listed as,
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.600]   this is what we're gonna get into next.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.560]   Listed as revolutionary,
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.840]   but it's definitely a large evolution, evolutionary jump.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.360]   And we're gonna get into iCloud next.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.800]   Of course that was Apple's big announcement.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.640]   But before we do that,
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.240]   I wanna thank one of our sponsors, Carbonite.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.000]   And of course we're talking about the cloud.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.600]   And Carbonite, of course,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.280]   is one of the great ways of backing your files up,
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.480]   straight into the cloud.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.360]   Now, I mean, we're gonna talk about iCloud with Apple,
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.160]   but I don't think this is necessarily a replacement
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.000]   for these kind of things,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.360]   because we're not talking, you know, Carbonite is storage.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.240]   So you're actually storing stuff into the cloud.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.320]   You're not just sinking stuff between all your computers.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.120]   You are going up to, you know,
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.720]   the thing you have to remember is that, you know,
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.840]   there's a lot of things,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.120]   there's a lot of bad things out there
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.800]   that can happen to your computer.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.640]   That, you know, whether it's being stolen or water damage
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.680]   or fire damage or kid damage,
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.640]   which is the number one concern of mine at this point,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.920]   is, you know, so all of those things are things
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.760]   that can happen.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.040]   And the bottom line is, is that you need to get it
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:44.880]   into the cloud.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.560]   And so of course, it's safe, it's easy to use,
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.360]   it's automatic, you can just have this stuff
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.440]   automatically back in your files up to the cloud.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.440]   And of course you can get those files back
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   if you have lost them.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.360]   And of course you can see them from anywhere,
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.400]   your iPhone or Blackberry.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.080]   If you wanna back it up and have it wherever you're at,
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.800]   of course, Carbonite is just a great way to do it.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.000]   And of course it works on the PC or the Mac.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.920]   It's only $59 a year to have all of that
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.480]   and to have that storage.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.960]   And you can try it for free if you wanna go to carbonite.com/macbreak.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.000]   You can give Carbonite a chance
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.480]   and see if it's the right solution for you.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.520]   You won't need a credit card.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.440]   You can just simply put some stuff up there
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.720]   and see if it works as far as cloud storage goes.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.880]   And, you know, but figuring out, you know,
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.480]   I think a lot of times people ask me what my backup strategy is.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.600]   And I say I wanted to have it in two physical locations
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.640]   and one cloud location.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.880]   You know, that's kind of my approach.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.160]   I've got Drobo's, you know,
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.080]   that are kind of synced up in different places
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.000]   that keep track of all this stuff.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.800]   But I also, I wanna get it, you know,
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.440]   out of the terrestrial environment
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.080]   and get it into some other, you know,
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.440]   some other place far, far away.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.840]   And Carbonite is a great way to kind of approach that.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.920]   So definitely check that out.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.200]   And so now, of course, we, speaking of the cloud,
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.840]   we're gonna jump right into the cloud here.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.520]   Apple, of course, now allows you to store your content.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.360]   Now, this is the beginning of the process, I think.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.520]   You know, this is definitely,
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.600]   it looks like a step forward in an evolution
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.680]   that Apple is gonna be building.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.960]   I felt like it was simple enough
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.760]   that this isn't the whole solution.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.360]   But I think that it is definitely, you know,
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.720]   it looks like they're moving, of course.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.480]   Steve Jobs, in a rare moment of candor,
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.200]   says, you know, "Mumble me, it wasn't our finest hour."
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.720]   You know, which I thought was very interesting.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.720]   You know, you know, Apple generally just says,
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.880]   you know, this was really great,
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.560]   but this is even better.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.840]   Yeah, we didn't see that there.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.680]   So it was an interesting,
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.280]   but we've seen some of the stuff in the press.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.240]   We kind of heard it coming, right?
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.080]   - Yeah.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.000]   I think we talked about it last time I was here is,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.720]   anybody's used my bumble me,
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.920]   knows how bad the experience has been,
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.120]   how it hasn't, you know,
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   I think it was going to be the solution.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.240]   So Steve got up there and said,
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.800]   you know, we haven't got it right,
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.760]   but we have learned a bunch of things.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.960]   And so now we're gonna--
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.400]   - And I think that the challenge is,
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.800]   is that I think one of the advantages
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.880]   of home mobile me for that long
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.760]   is that it was fundamentally flawed.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.480]   The issue was, is that it,
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.160]   foundationally, was never gonna work.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.800]   You know, and it was developed in a different time.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.040]   You know, and it was developed with different assumptions.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.760]   And I think that what we're seeing here,
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.440]   High Cloud looks to be a, you know,
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.880]   a completely new solution,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.200]   just to run down some of the stuff.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.680]   Of course, mobile me, mail, no ads.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.200]   But of course, thinking between all these applications,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   which we kind of have now.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.440]   And if you're not using a pop server,
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.440]   if you're using an iMac server,
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.520]   you're kind of having to some degrees thinking,
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.800]   but it is a little, I will say that what's,
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.960]   people, a couple of people asked,
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.840]   they were emailing me about it was,
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.520]   the question was, is that how is that different
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.360]   from being on iMac?
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.800]   Well, one of the things is if you send a document
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.000]   from your, from one computer,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.800]   you might see people's response on the other side,
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.880]   but you won't necessarily get the document
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.160]   on the other side, which is a little bit of a pain.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.560]   You can also see all your purchases on all your devices.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.200]   So you buy something and it'll be spread out.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.600]   It'll back, you know, it'll back up
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.720]   the information that you want.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.520]   It doesn't say exactly how,
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.200]   I didn't really get, Aaron, did you,
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.080]   did you completely understand, you were there,
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.040]   how the actual backup works that they were talking about,
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.120]   as far as backing up your documents?
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.880]   Yeah, so it looks like it's an incremental backup.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.400]   So it figures out the delta of all the documents.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.000]   And so each application can have a document directory
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.200]   on the device, which the users don't see,
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.720]   but the developer does.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.960]   And I would imagine that's figuring out the differences
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.880]   in uploading those to the server.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.000]   And this is really an application by application.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.640]   So this isn't like you're creating a folder
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.720]   and storing files up there.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.640]   No, it's application by application.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.640]   Right, so each application can decide
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.840]   that it wants to develop it,
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.360]   which I think is a great opportunity.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.360]   I mean, it seems like developers are gonna almost have
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.680]   to get that in there pretty quickly
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.680]   'cause people are gonna expect it.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.920]   You know, as they go through.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   As they go through.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.800]   Go ahead.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.920]   And it's something that we were all sort of playing
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.760]   with how do we do?
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.800]   And everyone is hand rolling their own solution,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.240]   so to have a real Apple approved API
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.040]   and a known quantity for the server
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.960]   is a huge step forward for all of us.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.400]   And maybe confirmed this for me, Aaron,
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.440]   but he said PC as well?
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.360]   You did say PC.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.240]   I was very surprised by that,
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.520]   but he does say PC as well.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:40.080]   So I imagine they're creating libraries for the PC.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:40.920]   Yeah, I looked at that.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.960]   I was like, what does that mean?
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.120]   Like, what would you put it on?
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.360]   But I guess it's music and so on and so forth.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.400]   I don't know what else you would.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.000]   I understand photos and music.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.040]   I'm using an application on both the Mac and the PC
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.280]   that needed to share data back and forth.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.120]   And it's interesting because this is sort of
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.160]   where the difference between the Google approach
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.360]   and the Apple approach happens.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.680]   So on Google, they say, well, the cloud is the future,
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.280]   but you're going to access it all through a web browser.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.880]   And so it won't matter whether you're on the PC or the Mac
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.840]   because all your data will be available
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.440]   through the browser, which will be essentially
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.000]   the operating system.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.880]   Whereas what Apple is saying is we're gonna store
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.800]   the data on the cloud, but you're going to look at that data
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.920]   through a custom native application
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.360]   because that's the only way we can create a rich experience.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.640]   - Well, and I think that argue that the mobile me failure
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.440]   was that Apple was trying to do it the Google way
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.560]   and it didn't really work.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.800]   - Well, and I think that one of the things
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.400]   that's interesting is that I do think that there is
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.280]   this fundamental collision that's going on.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.200]   And we don't know who's gonna win necessarily
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.840]   or maybe no one will win, is that there is this idea
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.400]   is everything gonna be on the web
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.760]   or is it gonna be on the net?
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.400]   And what I mean by that is, do you have net enabled
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:03.000]   applications or do you get everything through the web?
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.400]   I happen to, I'm not one of those people that I,
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.120]   so I say this as someone who makes all their money
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.600]   on the web that I hate web pages.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.880]   (laughs)
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.800]   I hate the web development, I hate web pages,
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.600]   I hate all the, I just hate the web.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.840]   And it's this necessary evil that I have to deal with
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.880]   on a day to day basis.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.640]   And it seems that the,
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   because as a developer, I always feel like you're
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.280]   your lowest common denominator.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.720]   You have to work across all these stupid browsers
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.640]   and you have to get it all to work on all of them
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.720]   and it never works the same way in all of them.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.960]   And so you end up just dumbing everything down
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.120]   to something that was a great design and now it's not.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.520]   You know, and now it's just functional.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.360]   And any kind of creativity to me just gets beaten out of you
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.720]   as you work on these pages.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.080]   And the other side of that though,
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.720]   the other option is you have a cluster of content,
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.160]   you know, cluster of data and you have a whole bunch
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.080]   of Net-enabled applications through your iPhone,
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.000]   your iPad, your computer that are simply accessing
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.320]   that content and that seems to be more of the Apple
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.920]   approach to that, which is what I think Aaron
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.240]   was starting with there is this idea that,
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.640]   yeah, you can get to it via the web,
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.280]   but the real solution is to get to it via applications that are.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.960]   Now, Aaron, do you see applications being able to share
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:31.840]   this data between, so like, you know,
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.520]   if one application is creating certain kinds of content,
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:38.320]   other applications being able to dip into the same content?
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.400]   - I'd have to look at the API to know for sure,
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.720]   but I would imagine that there would be some sort of a label
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.640]   on your data type and you'd be able to share it
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.400]   between different applications.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.600]   I think one of the really curious things about this
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.840]   is that calendar, we were talking about sharing in iCloud,
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.680]   that you said, oh, and you'll be able to share calendars
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.440]   between you and your wife, which is a great thing,
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.840]   but there was no more talk about sharing between people
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.280]   and I really thought I was hoping that there'd be some
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.080]   discussion of the idea of sharing a photo stream
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.000]   or sharing documents with people through iCloud
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.800]   and there really was no discussion of that.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.840]   - It does seem to be a very, right now,
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.880]   and this is one of the reasons that I thought that this
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.640]   is a very early conversation, like this is the first rollout
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.000]   of iCloud and we're not gonna try to make it any bigger
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.880]   than it are, you know, we're not gonna make a bigger jump,
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.360]   is that I did pick up on exactly what you're talking about
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.280]   where I was like, you know, this is all very personal,
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.480]   this is all how do I use my computer,
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.120]   but immediately, like for instance, with that photo stream,
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.440]   I was thinking about, you know, the idea,
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.160]   and we were talking about a little bit on the pre-show,
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.600]   of this idea of what if I'm at an event, you know,
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.320]   a wedding or a, you know, or some kind of a concert
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.840]   or something like that, where you have a bunch of people
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.040]   with iPhones and what, you know, couldn't it be cool
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.520]   if they were able to sync all of that up
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.080]   so that all those photos were going into one place?
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.480]   You know, they were all getting the photos
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.440]   that they were, that they as a group are taking,
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.400]   or more importantly, like you had Apple TV up there
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.920]   showing a big monitor or a big screen
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.200]   constantly posting those images.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.600]   - And then I guess the next step is you wanna be editing,
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.960]   you know, multiple people editing the same document
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.560]   and that's a really hard problem to solve.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   - Yeah.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.440]   And it's something that I think that has only just started
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.400]   to really work correctly in Google Docs, you know, you know,
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.040]   I mean, I think it was very rough
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.640]   and it generally works now, I think fairly well,
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.520]   but it was, it's been rough going through that process.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.680]   But yeah, so it's a very personal thing.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.720]   Of course they,
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:39.240]   the, one of the big things, of course,
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.720]   the thing that we talked about a fair bit
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.160]   is iTunes and the cloud, so now you can,
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.080]   once you buy something, you can sync it up to 10 devices,
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.560]   can just automatically get the songs that you bought.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.560]   So now you could do this before,
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.480]   I mean, you could plug a whole bunch of devices
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.320]   into it and have the ball syncing to the same computer
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.640]   and they would all get the songs and all get the apps
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.800]   and all get those, you know, that was possible before,
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.160]   but it was fairly painful.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.680]   - I see, I think to solve a lot of problems for
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:14.640]   people not exactly like us, like I see how less techy
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.800]   people use their iPhones, et cetera,
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.680]   and they don't sync, they just plug in their little charger
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.480]   or that little, you know, kind of thing.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.680]   And they never plug it into the machine itself, it's,
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.600]   I don't, you know, too much problems, too much,
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.800]   just they couldn't be bothered,
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.600]   that's not their kind of day-to-day flow,
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.160]   they plonk it down somewhere else
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.240]   and now that they don't have to do that,
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.120]   I think that will make, as a consumer device,
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:40.960]   so much better.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   - Yeah, I think, I think you're right.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:42.800]   - All right.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.640]   - Go ahead, Aaron.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.320]   - I have a prediction.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.160]   - Yes.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.240]   - The Apple Car Stereo.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.680]   The reason why there wasn't an Apple Car Stereo now
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.160]   is 'cause there was no way to get the 20-pin connector
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.560]   down the driveway and into your house.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.080]   Now, we can have the Apple Car Stereo.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:02.280]   - Oh, and it just automatically syncs.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.600]   - Syncs of the cloud, 3G.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.120]   - That would be nifty, wouldn't it?
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.600]   Yeah, that would be-- - That's my prediction.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.680]   - Okay, well, we'll have to see.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.840]   I mean, it wouldn't have to be,
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.880]   I guess it would have to be a car manufacturer
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.600]   actually working with Apple to develop it, right,
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.160]   to get it installed 'cause--
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.360]   - No, it could be an aftermarket one.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.440]   You'd go to Best Buy and it would be there on the shelf,
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.480]   the Apple Car Stereo.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.800]   - I just, I don't know.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.760]   I don't know if Apple would do that though.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.080]   I don't know if they'd build an aftermarket anything.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:30.920]   - So the,
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:39.520]   we're getting Leo's car went in?
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.440]   - No, don't account.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.680]   - Oh, John McAllister's calling it.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.760]   - Okay, very good.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   So the, sorry, I didn't read this correctly.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.400]   So I was like, "John McAllister is telling us
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.760]   "that Leo's calling in, how does that work?"
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:57.040]   So yeah, so John McAllister is gonna be available here
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.360]   in a second, yeah, but I could definitely see
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:04.360]   some kind of car attachment that would allow you to do that,
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.680]   but I don't know if Apple would do anything
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.480]   that would require an install.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.120]   That's the hard part that I have a hard time.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.760]   You know, they like everything to be kind of self-contained.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:20.880]   But now, of course, the big one more thing
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.840]   as we move forward is, of course,
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.960]   this is, I thought this was the most interesting part
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.800]   of the whole thing.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.760]   Of course it was the one more thing.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.200]   It was what we were all waiting for,
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.880]   but this was iTunes Match.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:35.880]   So iTunes Match 2499 per year, not per month,
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.360]   which is, I said, during the thing,
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.400]   which was very off, but 2499 per year,
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.320]   what this basically sets up is not only can you sink all
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.440]   the things, but people like me,
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.560]   I mean, this was the first thing that,
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.640]   when they said it'll handle all your purchased songs,
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.840]   the first thing that went through my head is,
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:57.560]   I ripped hundreds and hundreds of CDs into my collection.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.160]   You know, a long, long, you know,
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.680]   I don't know how long ago, five or 10 years ago,
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.880]   you know, when I stopped buying plastic.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.000]   And now, what am I gonna do?
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.160]   I don't, this whole syncing up is not particularly interesting
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.440]   to me because I can't, because I'm not gonna get access
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.080]   to the vast majority of my library.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.280]   But this is, you know, right now what they're saying,
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.840]   2499, you can put them in, it's gonna match them
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.480]   and put them in the cloud, match them in the cloud.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.080]   So you're gonna basically have a backup,
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.120]   it'll sink all your, to all your devices,
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.920]   it'll sink all of those songs.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:34.000]   I just, it seems almost like it's,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.160]   it's one of those things that seems almost unreal,
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.160]   you know, because theoretically you have a bunch of people
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.720]   who downloaded thousands of songs from,
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.880]   from, you know, Napster and LimeWire and BitTorrent.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.160]   And it seems like they're just able to
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.240]   legalize the whole process, you know?
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.920]   But they have to pay their subscription every year.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.440]   So, the big question in my mind,
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.120]   when I was watching that is, okay, this is great,
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.200]   looks great, put all your music up there.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.640]   If you have it already, it goes up there, you know,
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.280]   if they have it on their servers,
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.520]   all the better because they give you a better quality version
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.840]   and you don't have to upload it because it's just matching.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.200]   If they don't have it, then it will upload,
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.040]   how's this gonna be paid for, you know?
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.440]   The majority of music companies aren't gonna be happy with this
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.320]   and there's your yearly subscription, you're 24.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.600]   Now the question is, is that it doesn't seem like Apple
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.120]   is really doing DRM, so the real question is,
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.840]   unless these are special DRM,
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.640]   the question is, is do you lose access to them
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:35.760]   if you stop paying your subscription?
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.640]   You just pay for a year and get a little converted.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.960]   - I thought that one.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.640]   - I think-- - It did, it said DRM free.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.200]   So no, once you've downloaded them to your machine,
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.840]   they're yours.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.280]   - It's a very interesting puzzle.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.240]   So, but I guess the only argument I'd say is that it is a,
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:58.160]   it appears that Apple kind of made a deal with,
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.200]   I was gonna say a deal with the devil.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.360]   I don't wanna say that on a big show
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.360]   about the record industry.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.760]   Anyway, so, but made a deal with the record companies,
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.480]   basically say, well, you're not getting any money
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.480]   out of these guys now,
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.240]   you might as well get something out of them, right?
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.000]   And also joining us here, Don McAllister,
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.200]   were you actually at the event done?
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.000]   - Yeah, hi Alex, yes I was.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.840]   I'm still suffering a bit from jet lag,
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.520]   so I actually woke up at four o'clock this morning
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.520]   and some friends of mine said they were gonna go start
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.600]   queuing up a course to five,
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.280]   so I went along with them,
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.960]   so it's been a fairly long day up to now,
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.520]   but very enjoyable I have to say.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.480]   - So, we are near the end of this coverage,
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.320]   yeah we're trying to,
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.560]   and is there anything that really stood out for you
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.240]   at the event?
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.320]   - I think there's no one thing,
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.840]   well, I suppose the one thing in iOS
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:52.240]   that really stood out for me was the documents in the cloud,
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.680]   you know, been really screaming out for some unified,
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.000]   sort of sharing of files between all our devices,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.240]   and I think documents in the cloud is the way to go.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.480]   I've been a sort of a different person,
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.960]   I wrote some documents on the plane on one iPad,
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.880]   I brought two iPads with me, one for testing,
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.120]   and one from a live one,
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.440]   I wrote some documents on one,
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.880]   I wanted to transfer it to the other,
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.000]   I wanted to transfer it to a Mac,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.400]   and it was just a complete nightmare.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.000]   So that would be fantastic, so that's really good.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.640]   And the whole iCloud thing,
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.360]   I just heard your comments about this new service,
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.880]   the iTunes match.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.240]   Up until they did the one more thing,
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.360]   I was really disappointed about it,
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.120]   I thought they were just going to restrict it
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.240]   to purchase music,
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.840]   and then the one more thing and the iTunes matches.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.880]   I thought, "Oh goodness, I didn't quite go right the way
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.800]   "through to a full subscription service."
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.280]   But, you know, it's a good halfway house,
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.480]   and it's a great way of legitimizing
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.960]   and getting all your collection up onto the cloud
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.240]   so you can stream to all your devices.
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.040]   I think that, I agree with you,
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.680]   I think they have done a deal with the record company,
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.280]   I mean, they're getting nothing for those tracks
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.080]   that might have been ripped illegally now.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.400]   I mean, most people have legally ripped music,
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.240]   you know, they've got CD collections that they've ripped,
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.040]   but those individuals that do have illegal music,
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.640]   they're not getting anything for them now,
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.000]   so they may have to make some money from it
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.320]   because they're not going to be able to stop them
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.120]   actually doing that.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.560]   Well, and the rumor is that Apple paid upwards
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:15.600]   of $150 million to the record companies to get them to buy.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.160]   They bought them, you know, they said,
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.520]   "Well, we don't know how much money you're going to make,
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.640]   "but we can guarantee that you're going to make some."
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.960]   Yeah, well, just think of the amount of investment
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.520]   that they've put into these product launches today.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.400]   I mean, it's not just the software products,
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.240]   it's the whole infrastructure they've had to build,
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.640]   you know, the huge data centers.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.800]   They've invested billions and billions, I would imagine,
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.600]   Apple, on putting the service together.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.360]   So this is, as Steve said, you know,
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.840]   the culmination of 10 years' work,
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.320]   ready to get these services aligned and in place.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.800]   It's a huge risk for them.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.000]   I mean, and Steve himself made a big joke about mobile me,
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.160]   and, you know, why should we trust them
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.640]   after the mess they made with mobile me?
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:52.600]   But, you know, I'm sure they've lent tons
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.480]   from those mistakes that they did with that implementation.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.200]   And although it probably won't be completely smooth running,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.920]   I'm sure it'll be a lot better than the mobile me implementation.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:03.640]   And in some respects, there's the sort of betting
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.080]   that company on it, because it's such a huge undertaking
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.200]   that they've got to get it right.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.560]   Well, and they had to do something with the cloud.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.640]   I mean, that was the thing.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.200]   You had to move forward.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.120]   You had to get this, you know, had to do something,
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.040]   you had to start going down that direction.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.400]   The, the, I do think it's interesting,
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.480]   it's a very elegant solution, where Amazon and Google,
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.760]   we talked about this a little bit on the special,
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.240]   but when Amazon and Google really took the quick,
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.080]   you know, we're just going to let you store stuff in there.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.040]   We're not going to ask, they didn't try to go through
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.200]   and get permission from all the record companies.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.920]   They didn't try to, you know, do all,
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.680]   oh, they tried, but they decided not to bother.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.760]   But the, you know, by Apple, by spending
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.240]   an enormous amount of money on it,
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.960]   basically also solves this problem.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:44.240]   One of the reason they can charge you 25 bucks a year
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.920]   is because they aren't trying to give you,
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.480]   each person doesn't need 150 gigs of storage,
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.840]   because all they're doing is identifying what songs
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.080]   is in a central storage area that you have access to.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.760]   So it's just pointers, which are cheap, right?
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.720]   Rather than, rather than whole data.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.800]   - Yeah, I mean, you've got to wonder whether
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.720]   about Google and Amazon really rushed to market
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.360]   with their offerings, because they knew, you know,
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.880]   Apple would come in long with something
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.960]   probably a bit more sophisticated,
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.760]   because it does feel very rushed, you know,
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.440]   that the whole announcement and implementation
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.760]   of the Amazon and Google services does feel rushed.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.760]   And Apple have obviously had time to do it right.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.400]   And let's just hope they, you know,
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.200]   they come through on the execution of that.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.040]   I'm sure they will.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.520]   I think they've had plenty of time to get it right.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.400]   - Well, and one of the things that,
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.480]   this is coming up in the chat room
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.640]   that we'll have to keep track of is this is all a deal
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.880]   that we can assume is only working in the United States.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.240]   So, I mean, you know, yeah, I mean, this is--
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.600]   - I think at the moment, yeah.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.240]   - Yeah, and you know--
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.080]   - No, go ahead.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.560]   - I think Europe's gonna be just downright ugly.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.120]   You know, that's in my opinion.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.920]   I mean, you know, the rules and the process of that
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.360]   is a bit of a mess.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:51.640]   So we'll see how that turns out.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.400]   Anything else that really stood out for any of you
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.920]   as far as things that we haven't discussed, Aaron?
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.280]   - No, not really.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.000]   You know, Steve always says the word automatically, oddly.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.560]   I find it distracting, he says, automatically.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:08.120]   (laughing)
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.520]   Is that bother anybody else?
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.640]   - I didn't notice until now,
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.720]   and now I'm gonna think about it all the time.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.960]   Thank you very much.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:19.400]   - So Keith, any last thoughts, any directional?
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.840]   - I'm looking over our little list here
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.920]   of everything cloud related.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:30.920]   And it's some tweaks, you know?
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.440]   Better experience, and I think,
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:39.280]   and just opening up that no longer will app developers
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.040]   have to think about, like Aaron was saying,
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.880]   have to think about how we're gonna build this synchronization
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.400]   between our apps, accessories, et cetera.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.280]   Here's a really nice way to do it.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:48.640]   And I think more than anything else,
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.320]   I mean, all of these progressions
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.080]   that the cloud service brings is a real,
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.800]   I mean, this is really a lock-in.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.760]   You know, where you're in the Mac world,
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.440]   whether you're a developer or whether you're a user,
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.360]   you know, all of these things are very, very seamlessly
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.200]   pulling you into it.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.520]   - Do we mention it's free?
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.600]   - Yeah, it's free.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.040]   Like everything other than all of these services,
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.840]   all of these services that we've seen up until,
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.840]   other than the iTunes match service is free.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.360]   You know, all of those in between,
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.600]   and I think that that is,
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.520]   but I think that this is just tantalizing,
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.560]   you know, just so seamlessly pulling people
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.360]   into an environment where you don't wanna work outside
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.960]   of that environment, which of course is the point.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.240]   And once you get into it, I think if you start
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.000]   fully utilizing these things,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.720]   I think it becomes very hard for you to wanna,
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.400]   you know, go outside of this ecosystem.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.840]   - The thing that grabs me is make sure that password
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.480]   you've got for your Apple account is secure.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.160]   - Yeah, that is a great, that's the one thing
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.520]   with all of this integration is like when he said,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.520]   and you could just have another iPhone and then turn it on,
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.360]   you know, and just all you should do is code in
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.440]   and it'll just, everything will come down.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.240]   And I thought, I thought is like,
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.000]   - Changing my password tomorrow.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.520]   - You know, you know, 'cause it was just,
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.800]   you know, you're gonna have to start really thinking
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.840]   as a user about some real, you know, hash,
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.560]   you know, something that's gonna be more than just
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.760]   your wife's, you know, middle name, you know,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.360]   kind of thing to make sure that,
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.400]   'cause it does look like people can get a lot of data
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.280]   really quickly, you know, with a simple piece.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.240]   So it'll be, you know, interesting to see,
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.080]   see how that happens.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.640]   Some people are asking about carrier data caps.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.360]   A lot of this thinking, it looked like they were really
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.240]   talking about Wi-Fi.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   So they were talking about some of it over 3G,
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.960]   but a lot of the heavy duty lifting looked like it was
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.760]   mostly Wi-Fi and not as much,
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.280]   not as much 3G, at least when I looked at the slides,
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.280]   when they were going down there.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.240]   But though, you know, some of it will be 3G
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.680]   and you'll have to keep, you know, definitely you don't
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.560]   want to do big syncing over your 3G connection
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.360]   if you don't have an unlimited solution.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.440]   - Do we know what hardware is supported for iOS 5?
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.440]   - They talked about the iPads, iPhone 4, of course,
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.080]   the iPod Touch 3rd and 4th generation,
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.600]   iPod 3GS, but not 3G.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.280]   I bet you it'll push 3G-es pretty hard, you know,
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.800]   but those seem to be, you know, both,
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.280]   obviously both versions of the iPad.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.360]   So fairly, other than the 3G, I think everything,
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.120]   other than the 3G in the first two generations
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.000]   of the iPod Touch are supported.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   So most of what we have, I think, will be out there.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.360]   So it should be pretty good.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.440]   Now we're going to be prepping our picks of the week.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.280]   Don, I know you just came in, but we're still going to call,
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.080]   we're still going to make you pick something.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.200]   - All right, so we'll have a quick look.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.560]   - We'll give you a little bit of a,
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.160]   we'll give you a minute here, but before we get to that,
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.720]   I want to thank our sponsor Squarespace.com.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.120]   Of course, Squarespace is just the easiest way
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.640]   to throw up a website.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.920]   This is the one that I do my little blog in,
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.680]   and actually the public picks of course site
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.480]   and the DV garage site, they're all on Squarespace.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.600]   The great thing about it, of course,
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.240]   is that it's an easy to use UI.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.160]   I mean, it's just WizzyWig.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.280]   You just sit there and draw it out.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.280]   You have a lot of templates that you can,
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:11.760]   you know, hundreds of designs that you can start with,
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.960]   but they're fully customizable,
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.760]   and you can really kind of figure them out.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.480]   And, you know, as we were developing,
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.360]   I know the pixacord.com site, you know,
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.400]   Carolyn and I would be sitting there on Skype,
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.640]   moving stuff around and hitting save,
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.040]   and then moving stuff around and hitting save,
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.080]   and we don't know anything about HTML.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.520]   You know, we don't know how to do any of that stuff.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.200]   We just kind of move things in and out.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.560]   We don't have to figure out how we're going to upload it
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.080]   to the server, how we're going to install it,
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.000]   how we're going to, you know, what's going to happen next.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.160]   And then if we needed something
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.720]   that we really wanted to inject code in,
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.280]   we could have coders kind of finish that off,
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.920]   but you have all the modules that you need
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.800]   in a standard, you know, website.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.960]   So blog modules and form builders
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.240]   and Flickr photo displays and Twitter widgets
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.760]   and Amazon widgets.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.280]   I know I have a bunch of that stuff
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.760]   all kind of added onto my,
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:59.920]   you know, to mine is I just able to kind of throw that in.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.440]   I think my blog, which is border sack.com, four hours,
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440]   me fiddling around.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.920]   And most of that was creating the seamless texture
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.680]   that is the whole thing was most of the time
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.040]   that I spent on it.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.560]   The rest of it was pretty, was pretty straightforward.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.320]   So the thing I like most about it is,
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:22.040]   I mean, I switched over because of, you know,
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.960]   MacBreck Weekly kept telling me the benefits of it.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.920]   And so I have a little blog called UI and us.com.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.920]   And, you know, it's just, it's just techy UI interface
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.000]   related stuff.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.080]   Everything's fine.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.760]   You know, you write these little blogs with, you know,
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.360]   dreams of huge amounts of hits to your site one day.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.200]   - Right.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.680]   - And Mr. Gruber links to it once or twice.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.000]   - Right. - And the thing goes down, right?
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.600]   - Yeah. - And so I can't have that.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.120]   Because you've lived this dream of one day,
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.440]   somebody's going to pay attention.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.120]   And the day that they do, it's not working
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.640]   because everyone's looking on that one day.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.480]   - Exactly.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.120]   - So this is, this is, I switched over, that's it.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.560]   No more, I want, I want, I want to be able to be
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.880]   in that situation where it can spawn out as many machines
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.480]   doing whatever it needs to do to make sure everyone
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.800]   that one day clicks that link sees that,
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.360]   that's a little piece you've written in.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.560]   - Well, and, you know, I've helped a couple people now
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.480]   get their sites up.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.840]   And, you know, it's funny for me to be helping people
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.760]   get their websites up because it's, you know,
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.080]   I'm not, I don't know anything about HTML.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.400]   And I've purposely decided I just wasn't going to learn
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.280]   any of it because I was afraid otherwise I'd be fiddling
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.640]   with it and I don't have time to do that.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.800]   So, so the thing is, is that I,
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.680]   but I help people get their sites up because I say,
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.480]   like that's the one you want to use because I don't want
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.680]   to help you fix it later.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.400]   Like, I don't want you to do it in some other format
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.440]   that's more complicated because I don't want you
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.880]   to have to come back to me and, or whoever I put you,
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.200]   to make every single change, I want it to be easy.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.080]   And for you to just be able to change the things
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.960]   you need to change as an average user.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.600]   And, and so anyway, Squarespace is just a great way
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.880]   to kind of make that all work.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.840]   Now, you can get a 14 day free trial.
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.160]   You don't need to use a credit card or anything else.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.480]   You can just go up to squarespace.com/macbreak
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.520]   and you'll get 14 days for free.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.400]   And depending on how long you sign up,
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.960]   you can get up to 20% off.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.320]   So definitely check that out.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.600]   It is, I mean, you don't have to take my word for it.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.880]   You can go up there for 14 days, build your own website.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.640]   I think you're going to find that this is really
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.480]   the way to do it.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.000]   If you're not a developer and you just want to get a website
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.200]   up, a blog or your company website or your location website
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.560]   or your, or event website, this is just a fast and easy way
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.480]   to make all of that work.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.760]   So squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.880]   And now we're going to go around and start picking some software
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.040]   Keith.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.640]   You have hardware software to recommend.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:46.040]   Last time I was here, I had 14 picks with 16 other things.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.400]   So this time I've just got a little tiny one.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:48.960]   Very good.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.680]   And it's called Haze Over.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.600]   And it's in the Mac App Store.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.760]   And all Haze Over does is makes your most active window,
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.040]   the front most window look more obvious
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.160]   by making everything else just a little bit dimmer.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.040]   So it adds a kind of a semi-transparent background
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.840]   behind your most front most window.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.200]   So it's not a single screen.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.400]   It's not a single screen.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.400]   It's not filling up the screen.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.080]   It's not full screen.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.240]   So if you're not using a full screen app, which I'm sure
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.040]   this time next year will all be full screen all the time.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.320]   But the thing I find on the Mac is I just don't find there's
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.960]   enough-- sometimes I click something or I start typing.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.520]   And I didn't realize the window wasn't front most
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:32.520]   that I thought it was.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.680]   I just find that there's just not enough contrast between the
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.440]   most front most windows and something else behind it.
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.800]   And so this just lets you add a little layer of semi-transparent
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.160]   kind of black behind.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.480]   You can adjust the transparency.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.440]   I can't remember what it was, but it's very cheap, a little
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.080]   utility.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.160]   And it works well for me.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.240]   And you can adjust a bunch of things.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.400]   And so if you find yourself clicking on the wrong window
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.920]   occasionally, you wish it was kind of clear of what's the
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.000]   front most window.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:02.840]   This solves it for you.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:07.480]   So it's called Haze over Haze at E over E R, all one word.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.040]   And it's in the Mac app store.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.080]   How much is it?
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.440]   I have to look it up, but it's cheap.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:16.720]   Yeah, it's the new Mac app store environment.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.680]   No, usually not too expensive.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:24.320]   So all right, Haze over and Aaron, do you have a pick for us?
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:24.760]   I do.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.080]   So this week I had to do a lot of image editing.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.640]   And so I upgraded my Acorn image editor to 3.0.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.040]   And I was reminded of just how much I love this thing.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.760]   It's $49.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.040]   I find Photoshop baffling.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.960]   But Acorn is very responsive.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.600]   It does everything I needed to do.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.120]   It's a reasonable price.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.680]   It's available on the Mac app store.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.040]   I can't recommend it highly enough.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.200]   It's from a company called Flying Meat.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.720]   And one of the things about Acorn is that a lot of the
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.200]   stuff is much more GPU enabled, I think, if I'm correct,
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.000]   where a lot of that stuff is happening very quickly.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:58.440]   It is.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.760]   I think he's done a heavy use of core image.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.080]   It's very responsive.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:02.880]   Yeah, very good.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.880]   So Acorn and by Flying Meat software.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.680]   Now we're going to--
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.240]   Don McAllister, Don, do you have a pick for us?
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:11.920]   Yeah, go on.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.400]   And what I'll do is I'll pick an iPad app this time.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.160]   Still, even though I get lots of news through Twitter, I still
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.400]   use RSS feeds a lot.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.960]   And the application that I'm currently using on my iPad to
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.840]   access my Google Reader account is an app called Mr. Reader.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.480]   That's R-E-A-D-E-R.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:32.280]   It's relatively inexpensive.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.720]   It's $2.99 on the App Store.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.080]   And it's really nice to say, integrates with your Google
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.520]   Reader account.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.560]   It's highly customizable.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.000]   It's got integration with lots and lots of different
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:41.840]   services.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:45.160]   Really nice, clean way of reading RSS feeds.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.600]   You can configure the controls.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.920]   So if you like to have the sort of thumb controls on the
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.920]   left-hand side or on the bottom or on the right-hand side,
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.640]   you can configure them whichever way you like.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:57.920]   You can sort of scroll through articles just by dragging
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.360]   the articles off the screen.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.720]   Really nice application.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.400]   So that's Mr. Reader.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:02.920]   Mr. Reader.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.240]   $2.99.
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.520]   Fantastic.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.520]   Now, we're just about at the end.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.080]   So Andy, all there is to do is give us a pick.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.120]   We always know your picks.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.400]   We couldn't miss that part.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.680]   Andy has been--
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.320]   while we've been chatting away, Andy has been
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.200]   slaving away on his article for Chicago--
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.160]   I'm assuming for Chicago sometimes, is that right?
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.240]   For the Chicago sometimes, it'll be online probably in the
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.400]   next 20 minutes to a half hour with a longer piece to follow
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.160]   sometime tonight.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.520]   But there was a print deadline that I had to deal with.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.560]   Yep.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:39.320]   It's no fun having to write 900 to 1,000 words in about an hour.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.880]   It's just not fun.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.960]   Alex, the movies make it look like it's so much fun, but it
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.280]   is, and they're telling you.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.880]   So we're winding down, but do you have a pick for our
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.240]   listeners?
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.520]   Or do you need a minute?
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.760]   Actually, I would need a minute, yes.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.120]   OK.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.520]   Then I'll go ahead and run my pick, and then we'll come
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.760]   right back to you.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.080]   So the pick that I have is--
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:10.560]   so for probably about 10 years, I have invested probably an
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.800]   inordinate amount of money in learning languages that I
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.760]   don't really learn that much.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.080]   But I pick up enough that I can actually understand what's
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.000]   going on.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.160]   So it's not like I'm masterful at many languages, but I go
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.000]   to a lot of countries.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.440]   And so when I go into those countries, I try to at least
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.960]   pick up a bunch of the nouns, pick up a bunch of the pieces.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.120]   And one of the things that I've used for the last 10 years
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.560]   is software or--
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.840]   started off as like director applications from a company
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.000]   called Rosetta Stone.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.320]   And I just found out yesterday that Rosetta Stone has
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.600]   released their iPad app.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.000]   So it's their total E HD by Rosetta Stone.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.720]   And so I just got totally, because I'm slowly working
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.440]   through-- I've gone to Paris enough times now that I'm
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.520]   slowly working through French.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.480]   Just so that I can-- so the Parisians don't make fun of me,
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:59.880]   which is important, not to be made fun of by the Parisians.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.600]   They look at you like-- there's this sneer that goes on when
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:06.480]   you talk to them in English or bad French.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.520]   But here's the thing is that it really is--
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.800]   it's actually a better experience than the actual
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.440]   application that they had is on the iPad.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.320]   One thing I'd love to see is I would love to see them
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.560]   actually make this available offline,
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.480]   because the time that I like to use Rosetta Stone the most
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.840]   is when I'm actually in a plane.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.880]   But it is a great interface.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.440]   It has many of the same features.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.760]   And I have to say, Rosetta Stone in general
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.120]   is a little bit magical, where you start going through
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.160]   these little things where you're just identifying the words
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.280]   and identifying the things.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.920]   And before you know it, you remember all of that vocabulary.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.120]   And then when people are around you,
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.600]   it's not that in the couple weeks before, something
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.280]   that's not like I'm going to become fluent.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.840]   But when I'm there and having conversations,
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.840]   I can understand what people are talking to me about.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.240]   I can understand what's going on.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.520]   And of course, I could get a lot better.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.600]   I just haven't been able to push it.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.480]   And one of the reasons that I wasn't able to push it
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.760]   was because I didn't like opening up my laptop.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.000]   And it has been going through my head for years
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.160]   that if I only had this on my iPad, where I'd just
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.240]   be able to sit there and work through this stuff on my iPad,
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.960]   I would be fluent in 10 languages as well.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.080]   Now here's the test, because I've got an iPad app that just
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.440]   was released a couple days ago.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.320]   And so I'm going to be trying it all summer,
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.320]   but I'm very excited about it.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.000]   Now, the thing to know is it's free,
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.880]   but you need to have a totally subscription to one
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.640]   of the languages that you're actually using.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.840]   I'm hoping that they're going to port Swahili, which I think
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.440]   is still in the old director format.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.000]   I've identified that they don't sell a lot of Swahili,
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.280]   not nearly as much as French.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.680]   So I'm hoping that they're going to port that,
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.920]   because that's the one that I'm really digging into more
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.680]   than anything else because of my work.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.640]   But it is a great way--
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.880]   so Rosetta Stone, I've tried most of the other language
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.200]   training, and I haven't found any of them
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.520]   that I learned nearly as fast as Rosetta Stone.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.520]   But I needed it to be on my mobile, my iOS,
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.400]   and it finally has made it over.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.560]   So if you're interested in that kind of thing,
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.680]   definitely check it out.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.120]   If you've already been using Rosetta Stone
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:12.120]   or you're using totally, definitely,
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.920]   it's a great, beautiful interface.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.880]   Now it's still connected to the web,
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.920]   but it's a great step forward.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.200]   So definitely check that out.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:24.280]   And now we're going to go back to Andy, who is ready for an stellar pick.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.280]   Well, stellar, slightly less-minute pick.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.360]   I have-- you know that I'm a big, big, big user for my iPad.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.000]   I would like to travel with it and leave my notebook at home
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.400]   if I can possibly get away with it.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.960]   One of the few things that hasn't really
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.680]   made the transition for me yet is blogging,
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.120]   where if I want to update my blog or someone else's blog,
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.640]   I still tend to use the actual web client via Safari
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.760]   rather than finding an iOS app to do it.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.040]   Because before now, every single app I have used and seen
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.760]   has been, what is the word that rhymes with duck only?
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.800]   It has the word S in front of the D,
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.720]   and it makes me want to harm living creatures
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.840]   whenever I use this app.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.320]   There's a WordPress app that's done by volunteers.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.600]   God bless them.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.600]   They invest their time.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.600]   They invest their passion.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.720]   But every time I've installed and tried a new version of this app,
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.440]   it'll do something like it'll lose my entire blog post,
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:22.320]   when I switch one app to another, or it'll post,
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.320]   but then it will destroy a previous thing that I had posted.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.640]   Just really, really terrible.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.760]   The closest thing to a really good blog app I've seen so far
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.640]   is called Blogsy.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.040]   And it's on the App Store for--
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.080]   I'm just looking it up right now.
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.040]   I believe it's $4.99.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.560]   But it's-- there you go.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.480]   It's currently priced up $2.99.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.680]   And it's really nice slick little editor.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.880]   Not only does it give you regular support
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.000]   for both WordPress and Blogger apps,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.960]   but also has a really cool little interface
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.800]   where it's got an editing view and then an HTML view.
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.720]   So you just flip it over.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.960]   Now you can start editing HTML.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.120]   It's going to be gone offline?
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:58.440]   So there.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.960]   OK, sorry.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.200]   There you go.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.640]   So you can easily get into-- if you need to use CSS
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.760]   to style your stuff, also it's really well integrated
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.800]   with all the usual social content services.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.760]   Like if I've posted something onto my Flickr feed,
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.440]   I'm sorry I don't have this posted--
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.480]   I don't have this on the screen behind me.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:20.960]   But if I want to take something out of my Flickr feed,
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:23.480]   I can just tap this Flickr button in this column here.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.960]   I can just simply tap my photo stream.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.120]   It'll give me a list that will populate of--
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:30.800]   there you go.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.560]   It's starting to download.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.320]   But it gives me a list of thumbnails of stuff
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.560]   that I recently uploaded.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:39.560]   And all I have to do is just drag it into Blogsy.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.120]   And something that pictures there.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:41.600]   Right.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.720]   And so it works with YouTube.
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.760]   It works with Picasa.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.520]   It has a preview that'll open your blog post directly
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.720]   into Safari.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.920]   It still has some rough edges.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.920]   But it's definitely-- it's given the state of blogging apps
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.640]   on iOS right now.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.680]   I will take a blogging app that works,
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:05.080]   is quite usable and functional, and will not
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.600]   cause me to lose stuff that I've just written, nor the stuff
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.160]   I've already posted to my blog.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.960]   The time when I really--
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:17.080]   I have a goal-- I hold myself to a standard for my behavior
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.160]   or the person that I would like to be.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.280]   I would like to be the person who doesn't
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.800]   streak what just happened when I'm using an app, hit post,
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.480]   and then find out that, oh, not only did you
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.560]   destroy the thing that I just sent you,
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.240]   somehow you took the 2,000 word blog post that was already
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:39.280]   up there that I posted on Mars at it.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.680]   And you destroyed that off the server as well.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.800]   So now I'm going to have to go into Google,
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.920]   find the cache, and get that article back,
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.920]   because you were not happy just destroying what-- oh, good God.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.280]   Not that you're bitter.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.080]   I'm still-- no, I'm still a little bitter.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.480]   I will copy the picture.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:00.880]   I am, as regular readers and viewers don't need to be reminded,
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.120]   I am but an imperfect vessel for the universe's perfection.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.080]   Although I try to bend myself on a daily basis.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.840]   So in the name of that application,
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.720]   it's called Blogsy, B-L-O-G-S-Y.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.880]   And it's from the official site for it is a bibson.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.400]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.840]   No, that isn't it.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.120]   My apologies.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.280]   I did a quick--
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.800]   Is it on the Mac App Store?
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.120]   It is on the-- well, it's on the iOS App Store.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.160]   It is 2 pounds 99.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.000]   It's from a company called Fomola.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:32.920]   OK, very good.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.560]   So if you go to-- actually, if you go to Blogsyapp.com,
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.440]   that's where you can get the whole Dog and Pony show about it.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:39.920]   Very good.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.760]   And Andy, where can people find you?
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.360]   You can find me at my website, the Celestial Waste
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.360]   of Ban with at either anopco.com or cwob.com
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.000]   or just go to suntimes.com, where you see my work for the Sun
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.760]   Times and on Twitter, I am inopco.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.400]   Aaron, where can people find you?
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.840]   Alex, can I put in a quick plug for contests we're doing?
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.840]   So Big Nerd Ranch does training and contract programming.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.400]   This year has been very good, Dustin.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.360]   And we want to give back a little bit.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.280]   So we are having a contest called the mobile for global good.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.040]   And the idea is that a lot of people
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.480]   have ideas for applications that would make the world
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.640]   a better place.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.320]   And we're going to pick one of these people
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:22.160]   and let them come to the class for free.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.520]   And then we're going to let them hang out with us for a week
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.560]   while we help them get started or hopefully
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.800]   complete their application for a week
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.360]   in the Big Nerd Ranch office.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.800]   And we're taking suggestions.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.720]   We're taking entries starting tomorrow.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.720]   So you can go to our website, big nerd ranch.com.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.040]   And you can find the information there.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:41.840]   That's fantastic.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.320]   I can't wait to see what comes out of it.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:44.880]   Me either.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.040]   When is it going to end?
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.240]   When is the--
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.440]   The submissions are due by June 24.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.440]   And then we'll pick who we think is most worthy.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.320]   Excellent.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.280]   Very good.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.240]   And it's called mobile for global or global for mobile?
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.840]   Mobile for global good.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.280]   Very good.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.000]   Very good.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.760]   And Don, where can people find you?
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.280]   Yeah, they can find me over at screencastline.com,
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.440]   which is the weekly video tutorial I produce.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.320]   All the other social media, links, et cetera,
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:14.400]   they can find it over at donmicalaster.net.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:14.880]   Very good.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.240]   And Keith, where can people find you?
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.840]   They can find me at skitch.com.
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.960]   That's SKITCH.com.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.480]   That's not just my accent.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.320]   And I wanted to mention a little thing.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.960]   That got a lot of laughs in here, actually.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.560]   Yeah, I just want to quickly mention
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.320]   that I've just been part of a new app.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.320]   And we're running a WWDC special.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.120]   And it's called Prototypes.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.160]   And it's on the Mac app.
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.440]   So it's basically a little app that
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.560]   lets you easily take existing mockups
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:48.000]   and turn them into an interactable mini website.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   It's such a little painless experience
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.440]   of getting your mockups into an interactable thing
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.480]   on an iPhone that you can play around with.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.800]   And we're doing $10 off just this week for WWDC.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.120]   So you go to PrototypesApp.com.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.440]   So this is basically you can throw up a--
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.720]   you can take your Photoshop, bring it all in a couple layers,
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.040]   and then figure out how you want it.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.120]   I'm going to click on this and something else is going to happen.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.560]   And you can kind of wire it all together.
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.800]   Yeah, so draw some hotspots, wire it together.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.560]   Workout is going to work on the device.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.960]   So the button's too small.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.560]   Does the navigation make sense?
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.120]   Click a button and it uploads to it.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.120]   That's integrated hosting.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.600]   So you don't need to know anything about hosting
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.480]   or have servers or know anything.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.160]   You can just be the person who has an idea
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.800]   and play with it on device and see if it's going to work.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.400]   Sounds awesome.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.640]   I downloaded it and I haven't gotten to dig through it very much
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.120]   yet, so I'm looking forward to it.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.280]   So thank you very much.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:40.960]   Thank you.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.040]   Prototypes is the name of the application.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.200]   Definitely check it out.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:49.480]   And just a reminder, before we go anywhere that this,
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.720]   you could have something that looks just like this,
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.400]   except not with a Twit.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.360]   It would be your logo or your name.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.840]   I think there's big ones.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:58.880]   This is the big one, right?
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.680]   So this is the big one.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:04.040]   And you can also just get your name, a couple of lines.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:05.360]   And these are the bricks.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.440]   The thing to remember is that the new studio is really big
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.960]   and really cool and you could be part of the foundation,
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.880]   of putting that together.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.560]   It's bricks.t-- I'm sorry, bricks.twit.tv.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:26.280]   And this is your chance to get your name on the wall.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.120]   At Twit and also really support the incredible investment
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.480]   that Leo has been putting into this--
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.480]   and the whole Twit crew has been putting into the new studio,
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.160]   which is just going to be fantastic.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.400]   I mean, they painted the floor over the weekend.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.640]   It's kind of smelly right now.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.840]   But it's going to be great.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.840]   That's all I'm going to say.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.840]   I guess that's not a very good ad for that.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.120]   It smells like wet paint at the moment.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:56.560]   But really, these bricks are-- I'm getting this one.
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.920]   This is a big pixel core one that's going to be on the wall.
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.840]   I'll take a picture and show it to you.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.160]   But definitely check it out.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:08.240]   bricks.twit.tv and support the development.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.360]   So thank you very much.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:15.200]   And without further ado, we're going to end this.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.400]   Get back to work.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.640]   Back break is over.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.560]   (upbeat music)
