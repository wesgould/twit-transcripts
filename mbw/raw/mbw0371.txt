[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.200]   I'm back. Thank you all for not leaving
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.680]   But you know we had great co-host. Thank you Andy and Renee for filling in for me. Nice job gentlemen
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.760]   I think I think we demonstrated that the format is sturdy enough that even when we do we try to drive people away
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.680]   They'll still be here. So I think that's a good name for it. This is the show with a sturdy format a
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.520]   sturdy format and he and I go from the Chicago Sun times good to see you my friend. Oh, so good to see you
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.960]   We're gonna Lulu. I saw a squirrel in Troy on
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.720]   The walls of Troy. I'll show you later. I went to school there not Michigan, New York
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.120]   Troy in the beautiful country of Turkey
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.880]   Did you go to school there?
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.320]   Well, I wasn't paying much attention during school. So I might as well have been in Turkey for all the professors prepared
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.480]   Thanks to Renee Richie filling in too from imore.com. I'm gonna see you Renee
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.440]   Thank you. It was at a Trojan squirrel and did you let it in it was must have been a Trojan squirrel and inside it was tiny little nuts
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.280]   I had to check show title
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.520]   You know, they don't really by the way Jason Stell from IDG and hello
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.760]   Hey, I'm Trevor director for both Mac world at PC world magazine good to have you as well. It's great to be here
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.720]   They uh, they don't really know that it's Troy, you know schleman went he said I think it's Troy
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.800]   He dug they found walls. He said it's Troy close enough close enough home
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.160]   And they make a big deal of Troy's like a layer cake
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.720]   There's five layers five different Troy's built one on top of the other and they make a big deal of that
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.720]   But they all look like rubble to me
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.000]   But the older rubble's a little
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.400]   It's historical meaningful level. Come on and on the highest level level six. There's a squirrel
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.640]   I had a wonderful trip to kick case nobody's interested, but uh, but I'm ready to get back to work
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.880]   And I understand that something happened with apple during my vacation
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.800]   Something what everything they denied that thing that everyone thought that they were doing
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.200]   But it wasn't true and so we now know it is
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.040]   There's a room or but there could be more a more a more details to come actually the number one question
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.200]   The wrong month to get to take off the number one question. Did you guys get an invitation today?
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.120]   Uh, I did not get an invitation today because if they were gonna do an event on october 15th, this would be the day
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.720]   Yeah, well the day's not over yet, but yeah, when did they do it last year?
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.680]   Uh last year it was I think six weeks after the the event in the previous month
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.000]   So it we would be on track for two weeks from from as we're recording this on the Tuesday and since you're going to
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.520]   I'm supposed to be going to Ireland next week. So please don't have an apple event next week
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.880]   No, I think I think we're all hoping that it's going to be on uh the 22nd 23rd somewhere in there
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   Renee are you hearing any rumbling rumors?
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.440]   Same thing is Jason. I mean it's they do it's like clockwork now
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.560]   It's it's just a matter of when they have the products ready to show off
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.720]   It's not really clockwork because october 23rd, which was last year's event was the first time they'd had a big event in october
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.200]   Yeah, this seems to be the new I mean there's a new clock a little bit
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.000]   It's like for one year and they can do it every two weeks of uh they'd have two weeks where they would do um a warning
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.560]   And now it's down to a week right just so make it as inconvenient as possible for everybody has to fly in
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.720]   And did they announce anything else while I was gone?
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.200]   I know we have a new phone and I want to thank by the way
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.640]   Josh windish on my staff and his wife finessa who works at the apple store who probably broke rules
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.280]   to squirrel aside no
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.280]   I'm sure it was all above board
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.960]   I I pathed him. I said i'm sure nobody did anything that would get them censured or fired from their job
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.560]   Absolutely untoward no no he I she waited in line for me
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.400]   There you go, but this is um unboxing it right now. This is a five s the gold
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.120]   And here I learned something interesting today
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.280]   All of you manly men have gold iPhones. Absolutely. What is the story with that?
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.240]   Well, it's brian clogas. You only acceptable color
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.080]   Well, we know it's different right. I actually want a golden, you know that it is kind of pretty isn't it?
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.680]   It's it's more of a yeah
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.680]   It's it really is a very subtle
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.080]   Understated not it isn't that hey look how much money I have so much money my phone is made out of gold
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.280]   So it's a it's a very classy sort of gold. Yeah, it's not a super shiny
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.720]   It's it's like I mean just like the silver one. This is the gold colored version of that. It's that textured kind of
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.880]   Yeah, it's a like like no, it's not like a warm big rich gold. It's just pretty
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.200]   Yeah, it's totally a distraction the fact that it's still a rounded rectangle Leo totally distract
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.520]   The gold ring around the home button puts it over the top and then this is of course the new touch id
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.360]   Is that what they call it touch id? So of course I was here when the announcements were made I was here for that event
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.120]   So what I didn't know is how well this touch id worked. We've had it for a while now
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   What do you think? Uh is it is the fingerprint sensor? Uh good
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.280]   Works like a charm for me
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.880]   It works really well, but you have to you really have to do a good job
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.880]   I think when you set it up for the first time because I think I I think I did the I I registered like my primary thumb
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.200]   Uh kind of quickly my excitement to get it to work and after like two weeks later of saying try again try again
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.000]   I finally like wiped all my fingerprints not off the my hand off the device and basically did
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.200]   Did a little bit more deliberately well here's where i'm going to be hitting here's where how i'm typically going to be touching this button
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.480]   Now i'm doing something to you do you guys do this i'm waiting till it's english
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.600]   Do you guys do that because once it's english then I can swipe it i'm afraid if I swipe it when it's korean
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.280]   It's just gonna stay that way. Do you guys do that or is that just me? That's just you
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.400]   I found the first touch id set up awkwardly. I like I wasn't used to it. I didn't know what I was quite doing
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.760]   It would vibrate. I pulled my finger off too fast. I put it back too slow
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.480]   It it took me a while. It was a second and third time were far better than the first. Yeah, I agree
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.880]   It was uh it tries to explain what you need to do, but it you've got a you know, I was like tap tap tap tap tap tap
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.000]   No, that's not how you do it. You got to be patient and and and it reads it once and then it actually tells you okay now
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.200]   Shift your position and so that you can get the other you know the corners of your of your print so that if you're in any kind of weird angle
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.000]   Um, it's smart. I like how they did it. It's very friendly and it works pretty well. Yeah
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.320]   It's also it's also nice enough to tell you that if when you're trying to register your fingerprint if it's if you're not giving it what it needs
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.400]   It will actually say hold it hold it longer now. Okay hold it again
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.400]   So it's the same passive disappointment as original GPS systems would get is it gonna do that at some point now
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.760]   Uh, you have to set it up
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.080]   So when you get through everything it'll ask you to if you want to turn on you turn on your passcode and then
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.440]   Um, you can you can have it also remember a thumbprint at that point
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.320]   It's tied to the passcode you have to have a passcode as well
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.000]   So you've got another method of authentication that for digit passcode
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.200]   Well, yeah, it doesn't have to be a four digit passcode in fact when I turn on touch id
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.640]   I went from a four digit passcode up to a much more complicated password
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.960]   Because I don't need to enter it very often
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.520]   So I think it's actually more secure in that way because because my alternate password is much better than
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.680]   The old four digit pin code that I used to use pardon me for covering old material because I know you probably talked about this
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.640]   It's new to me and but it's all i'm the only one it's new to
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.800]   And it's not like we
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.320]   It's like the entire world seems to think that everybody buys a brand new iphone the first week of release and then it steez
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.360]   Is to become of interest to anybody. We're done. What's next? What's new?
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.320]   We're only arriving in october leo. This is new for everybody. Well and that was why I was so pleased that josh
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.280]   Put one aside for me because I did try to order it and it said sometime in october and I thought well god
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.920]   I don't know if I want to be that out of the loop
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:30.480]   Faster yes, noticeably no super faster super faster
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.600]   That's best device for ios 7 I think so far
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.880]   Well, and I noticed that the ios 7 camera is much different
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.160]   I was able to get ios 7 on my i pad mini which I took with me
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.440]   And I and on my iphone my old iphone 5
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:50.320]   The camera is so much different but i i think it really is made this it's made for this camera, right?
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.160]   Yeah, I think the processor has a lot to do with it the dsp the you know signal processor in the in the
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.200]   The chip that's in the 5s. They're using that a lot
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:07.600]   There's a lot of back end processing happening in terms of what they're focusing on and low light and it's doing a lot of really intelligent stuff plus the new flash
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.640]   Um, so that you know the processor is not is new flash. There's a flash right here finally
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.560]   No, oh flash is now the double flash. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So it's now asking me to set up touch id
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.640]   So, uh, i'll do that right. Yeah scan the finger of thumb you normally use on the home button i'm a lefty
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.360]   So I just put it there. Okay lift and rest your finger repeatedly and what's as I do that
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.040]   It's filling in the little whirls and loops now somebody told me it's it's only taking nine points of similarity
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.360]   Which gives it more reliability?
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.240]   It then hashes though as it doesn't store an image
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.960]   Uh actually was a my friend chamala who's a turkish podcaster
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:51.040]   Who's also a security expert has used fingerprint readers for a long time. He said for that reason it's more reliable
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:57.440]   Right, but but the potential for a collision is higher right one and 50 000 so big deal right big deal
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.920]   I mean, what's the chance that one of that 50 that other 50 guy in the 50 000 is a crook
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.440]   That's basically the same chances that you'll have an evil doppelganger or anyone
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:12.800]   Right find your find your fingerprint twin. So I've lifted and rested my finger on the home button repeatedly and now it'll just my grip grip
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   What the hell's that mean just hold it hold the phone a little differently because chances are you use a different finger?
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.960]   No, no same finger
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   Is a finger forever?
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.680]   It'll remember because it's a different angle. Yeah, that's it because you don't always use the exact same angle
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.360]   So it was can I do my right finger?
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.560]   I've now committed to my left members up to five five
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.360]   So this will just be your first one surely basses left finger was the one that didn't make it as a hit
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.560]   Uh touch ID is ready your print can be used continue
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.520]   Now now I have to do a passcode
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:50.240]   Which I will do don't look and it's very very smart because it's one two three four that no, but that's if nobody would guess that I don't think
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:58.000]   We won't tell I like the way that they've really defined the fingerprint as a secondary sort of thing really the the passcode is still your primary
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.840]   Uh, and if you have not used your fingerprint in a while or if you've restarted the phone or a couple of the situations
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.240]   It'll last for your passcode before it will let you use
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.200]   Oh interesting
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.280]   So that passcode is not to be is not just a backup a fallback. It's really part of your primary
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.080]   Yeah, I think that's good
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.960]   You reboot 48 hours of pass since you last used it or you fail five times at alasky for your passcode again
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.080]   So that's it now if I if I lock this phone
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.320]   Now the next time I do this to unlock it
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.800]   Uh, I just slide it. Well, that's to put in the passcode or you can just do this
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.840]   Oh
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.440]   That's pretty cool. It leaves you pull day
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.360]   If you lock it again and then put down the center if I do that again
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.880]   And now I do the uh now pull down notification center first
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.200]   Yeah, now you can watch the icons fly in from underneath notification center. They call the cool kids
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.360]   Watch the icons. Yeah, put your thumb on it. Yeah
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.960]   Oh, I saw them kind of kind of kind of underneath in the translucency. Yeah
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.720]   I have to say of all the thing on iOS 7. I'm not thrilled about is that there's a lot of
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.640]   Flying in of icons. Yeah, and that's and that's why I think that a lot of people who are thrown off by iOS 7
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.320]   If you if you try it on the 5s, that's the first machine
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.520]   I think that's designed so that where the the animation is so smooth and so natural. It seems to make sense, right
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.360]   on my on my ipads and on my earlier generation iPhones
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.080]   It's it's not it's not it's not like it's it's terrible
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.840]   But there's enough of a hesitation. There's enough of a stutter that I'm noticing things moving in as opposed to annoying
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.200]   Okay, you're right. It is not so annoying on this. Yeah, it turns out. There's an uncanny valley for these kind of animations
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.840]   Yeah, funny and this one can manage it. Here's the other thing. I'm not crazy about I'd like to get your take
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.600]   I'm not crazy about the folders. It's open. I hate it. I hate it. It's terrible
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.560]   It's a mistake. They need to fix it. I've decided this idea that it's like they forgotten that when the only thing the folders are good for
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.280]   Are for launching apps from yeah, it's not as though well
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   I of course I want to see all the other game driving games that are in my folder when I quit when I quick it out quit out of that one
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.080]   The home button should be sacrosanct the home button should take me back to the home screen
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.640]   And now whether you're in a folder or a new stand
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.800]   That's the one that gets me as i'm reading an app in new stand and I press the button to go back
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.120]   To switch to another app and it shows me new stand don't want that and then I have to press it again
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.200]   Don't want that to go back out. That's just that's not how the home
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.400]   Don't like that. It's not
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.960]   I
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.400]   Explain what so people see what i'm talking where we're talking about for those of you watching
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.920]   So I opened the extras folder and I opened the calculator now home should and has always in the past brought us home
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.680]   Instead it brings us back to the folder. Yeah, i'm also not crazy about the folder layout
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.120]   I feel like it's a kind of waste of space. Although I learned which is kind of cool that you can have multiple pages in a folder
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.680]   Yeah, which is which is kind of an interesting idea
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   Right that that could be useful
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.600]   But i'm not crazy about the waste of space there. I feel like that's not it could be a little
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.760]   But that's a minor
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.880]   Sure
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.000]   This is I mean this is such a rethink for apple that there are lots of things that are weird about it that
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.480]   One would hope they will be fixing in future updates, but you know, they uh, it's very different and you know what I really like
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.120]   I really like the multi multi tasking
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.520]   Um, this is a really nice way to handle it. It's very webOS, right?
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.640]   Oh, have we seen this before? Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah, I don't know
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.600]   I think I cons help a lot the thumbnail. Yeah
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.920]   The ability to and the ability to swipe these off or the other thing I just learned multi swipe them off
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:29.440]   Yeah, the whole the whole whole down until it starts to jiggle and then there's a little tiny x
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.960]   I mean, that's such an unfriendly behavior. This is better. This is
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.560]   It's prejudiced against the idea that you would ever force quid and app whereas people just seem to think
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.280]   Are more naturally proposed to think that hey, i'm done with this. I want I want this gone now
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:49.120]   The other cool thing is I didn't notice until uh, I was using it for a day or two is that those previous are actually live
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.400]   So if you're playing a video, you will actually see the video continue to play as you as you cycle through that way
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.640]   I do think the camera is superlative
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.720]   Uh, and as much as I've used the other cameras the mojo x had an update. That's what I took to
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.000]   Yeah on my trip, uh, it's there's nothing like the iphone five and the five s is even better. Yeah
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.320]   Well, yeah, that's they made so many steps forward. There's only one step backward
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.880]   The the reason why I have this up here is that the the uh, the uh, the uh,
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.320]   The burst mode is more useful and more significant on the iphone than it is on any other camera
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.360]   Any other camera phone because this will simply shoot two frames per second at the exact same quality
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.000]   It shoots every other picture and I actually shot a video of how long can you hold down
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.640]   That that picked that that button so it got 200 and i was like and when i got back home
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   I was actually timing it out it shot
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.480]   230 something shots at 10 10 frames per second
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:46.720]   And then it slowed down to about seven or eight and it kept on that until about 500 at which point I got bored and stopped
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:53.200]   So that's and and so but i'm sorry what i'm getting at is that every time you're shooting an uncooperative subject or you know
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:00.160]   You're chasing your kid around and the kid is not going to stop and and please stand still please do this or you got a group shot of four or five people
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:06.000]   And not everybody has their eyes over to the same time this this idea of like holding the phone up and clicking one picture
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.200]   That's done on the on the five s you will almost always want to shoot a burst of 10 or 12 because one of these 10 shots is going to be perfect
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.800]   There's this one is the uh, I was shooting a burst of the squirrel in the tree
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.200]   And of 30 shots there happened to be two in which the pose was kind of okay
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.160]   And the the subject was sharp because this was a very there's like just a half an hour before
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.720]   For sunset and but if you if you get one shot at it, you're probably going to miss it
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.240]   But if you take a burst of 10 or 20, you're probably going to find at least one frame
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.200]   It's going to be pretty good. There's there's still one problem that I found with it
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.960]   It's I don't know why but it loves low isos. It will do anything. It will sell its first child
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.480]   Uh, on ebay to to take a picture with a low iso
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.880]   But it's because it's less grainy. You want you want it to do that, right?
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.480]   Yeah, well, but yet well
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.480]   It's a little bit it's going to be a little bit more grainy at a higher iso but the problem is that so it's saying well
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.560]   You're you're inside a library and it's sort of a dimly lit reading hall. I can shoot at 64 iso. Can't I?
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.880]   No, I'm gonna shoot a 64 iso
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.080]   No, I really I'm gonna shoot a 64 iso and if I'm gonna and the shutter speed is going to be one 15th of a second
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.360]   So hold it real real steady. Well, I can't pull it that steady
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.640]   So that's why there's there are there are a lot of shots in which if not for the fact that it was going for 64
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.800]   100 iso and a long exposure of like one 30th or one 15th
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.680]   One 15th it would have taken a better picture than most of the other phones. Is there no way to overrule that?
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:32.240]   None that I know of the the only trick that I've kind of found that kind of works is that I haven't certified this yet
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.600]   But I noticed that when I use the flash it tends to go for a shorter shutter speed
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.200]   But there's no way to force it to go for a shorter speed
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.760]   Yeah, sometimes if you if you tap and hold on a really dark area
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.560]   You you know you force it to adjust to the to the darkness and it will it will actually crank
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:58.000]   The iso is that down or up up so um, but it's it's finicky. It definitely is. Yeah. No, that's that's the one thing. I wish they'd fix
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.600]   I'm holding it wrong. Oh, there. Okay. It took four. We have a new we have a new we're holding it
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.640]   Touching it wrong. Uh, yeah, but I want to program. Maybe this finger to case, right?
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.200]   Yeah, my index finger up to five. I've got two thumbs and index finger. Yeah
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.880]   Okay
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.440]   You what what you'll discover is the all the different ways you happen to pick up your phone. Yeah, I just discovered this. Yes, you're right
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.520]   Yeah, right so I did my left thumb first and then I would use it for a little while I went
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.120]   Oh also right index finger
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.760]   And then I put it down on my kitchen counter and realize I was waking it up with my right thumb and it turns out
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.560]   I have four really common different ways
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.840]   Based on where the phone is that I pick up the phone. I had no idea
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.600]   So I can add uh, oh it says fingerprint one and I can now add fingerprint
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.440]   Okay, one of the nice things about that screen is if you touch your uh, if you touch your thumb to it
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.560]   Yeah
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:55.280]   It'll uh highlight it says oh that's finger so you can actually see my touch which one is which yeah, let me do that again. That's cool
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:00.080]   Yeah, that's finger one. Yeah, you know what finger two is no
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.640]   But there's no people know me a little too well, don't they
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.600]   They know what finger two is. They know what finger two is so now i'm going to do my index finger
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.240]   Because I want to I want to be able to do that as well
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.160]   I noticed when I want to take a picture. That's kind of how I hold my my phone up
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.280]   all right, so um
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:26.320]   I have noticed that the in general the the the feeling is that uh people are very happy is any negatives
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.160]   Well, there was the security issue. So let's talk about that. Vekronet richie. You were
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.280]   I'm more was it you that wrote that article and I'm more
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:39.520]   I saw the article in which uh, you said the media got it wrong and made it a security problem when it wasn't and what it wasn't one
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:45.520]   In fact at all now I avoided that i've already updated between the time I left there've been two versions of
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.440]   iOS 7
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:54.880]   702 Alex Lindsay always said don't use the first version of any apple o s don't use the second version use the third
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:01.520]   That fixes the problems that the second version added when it fixed the problems with the first version by the third by 7.02
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.480]   It's going to be good. So now's the time
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.560]   It wasn't so much the updates that it was just I
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:15.040]   iPhone 5s has these new security features and it has lots of them like activation lock and like touch id and trusted
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.960]   machine, but it also has a ton of new convenience features like
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.240]   um control center and you have to choose as a responsible adult user
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.360]   Whether you want a really convenient iphone or really secure iphone or some middle ground
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.960]   And the problem with the reporting is that they were phrasing in such a way that I was getting continual letters from people like
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.560]   Oh touch id doesn't work. I'm turning it off. I'm not going to have a passcode anymore
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.880]   Or this is a security flaw
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:47.360]   I'm and they were doing they were making choices that degraded their security due to misinformation that was being presented about it
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.240]   And the for example, uh, you can use control center to put your iphone in airplane mode
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:59.120]   From the lock screen and people were afraid that these would steal their iphones put it in airplane mode and they could entrack it
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.000]   Yeah, you can disable that very easily in the settings
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.720]   You can turn seria off so that seria only works from the lock screen with touch id enabled
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   There's all these different settings you can use but that's always been a problem seria was always
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:16.080]   Accessible from the lock screen unless you disabled it. That's not new and now if you disable it
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.600]   It's only accessible from the lock screen with touch id which I think is a much better choice
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.800]   And there were several things like touch id can be foiled
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.360]   Well, yes
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.560]   If you have a csi level person who goes to the trouble of duplicating your fingerprint in a multi step
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.760]   Not, you know, non-trivial process and then happens to get physical access to your phone
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.880]   Within the 48 hour window of you last using it with a finger and but it wasn't reported that way
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:45.040]   It was just reported as you know apple is doomed this stuff doesn't work and that caused a lot of problems how um, okay, so so
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.160]   You you would certainly recommend 702
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.960]   Especially if you're greek because apparently you couldn't
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:57.920]   The greek language didn't work properly and I was in greece who knew by the way i'm a little observation
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.160]   As i'm going around and I think this is going to be very interesting to see what happens
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.640]   Until we got to turkey where a lot of people had iPhones almost everybody had no key of phones
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.480]   I can't tell you how many times I heard do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.840]   Not only do they have no key of phones. They hadn't updated the ringtone
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.320]   No, no, no, it's like
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.360]   Everybody and I and it's of course it's because they're less expensive
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.800]   They're cheap kind of candy bar phones and I really wonder with microsoft buying no kia
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.640]   What's gonna happen in that world and that may be a huge opportunity for apple?
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.760]   I think that's why analysts are saying do a cheap phone apple and that I think maybe it's even more urgent
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.280]   Because no kia's basically I think gonna kill that market
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.400]   Right so anyway, I just just an observation from being somewhere besides the us
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.440]   I just think that we we don't we don't pay enough attention to the I don't care segment of the market
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.480]   The people for whom a phone is just a practical device. They have absolutely no emotional connection to yeah
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.440]   And so that turkey a lot of people had iPhones. It was very interesting
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.600]   I will note that my mother who's had a candy bar phone for her entire life
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.880]   Asked me today what I was doing with my iPhone 5. Yeah, I finished reviewing it. Yeah
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:09.440]   Yeah, there's a market it is it is warhol for her does they pop art iphone. Oh, that's interesting. It is, isn't it?
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.600]   All right, so battery life last question battery life
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:19.680]   Uh, I I find that it's as good as the iphone 5. However, that's disa you're not used
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:25.040]   You're not used to the fact that iOS 7 when you iOS 7 has different sets of defaults than iOS 5
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.760]   Excuse me that iOS 6 did so it's I was getting not as good battery life until I went in and changed all the Wi-Fi settings
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.280]   Back to the way that I had them before all the all the other notification things
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:42.480]   So back to the way I had before so I think that it's as good as the iphone 5 running iOS 6. That's that's good enough apple seems to be
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.640]   Optimizing for the idea that you leave the house in the morning
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.560]   You work and use use the phone a little bit while you're out and then you come home at night and plug it back in and not when you go to bed
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.480]   But before you yeah, and yeah, and that that works for me. I I have almost never had it
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.200]   Drop off before I got home at the end of the day, but that's what they're well
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.520]   You know I want 18 hours. This is what apple but apple once doesn't want to give you a thick phone with a big battery
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.400]   I mean, that's that you mean like this. Yeah, they they want to optimize for it's just a thick phone with such a big battery
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.120]   Yeah, I know it's sickening to even look at it
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.520]   So thick so I do you get absolutely gets I get all day
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.440]   I mean till I go to bed that night. Yeah, I usually do too
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.960]   I think there are some quirks in iOS 7 - where apps can run in the background now truly run in the background
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.240]   And occasionally I will get a misbehaving app and that will lead to tell you but that that happens everywhere
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.880]   You know, but apple obviously is going to solve for what it thinks is the right amount of battery
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.560]   And no more because they don't want to make it any bigger or any heavier
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Okay, so good enough not great
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.680]   Because didn't they isn't like 10% more battery in there. Isn't there more battery in that? Yeah, but it's doing more stuff
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:57.360]   Yeah, it's busier and it's got more background much faster stuff now too. Yeah. Yeah, I mean every time you switch
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.200]   From one app to another is doing so much graphics. Yeah, it's
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:06.320]   You meant that not the that the desk sure the parallax too. Yes every time you turn
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.520]   Which makes the phone so much easier to use
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:16.240]   I was so confused by not knowing if it said this angle versus that angle that the icons were not actually part of the desktop wallpaper
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.640]   Now it's very very clear to me
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.360]   They are trying to save power with some of the sensors like um, it's sensing
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:30.800]   The 5s is sensing when it's sort of like put away somewhere and not hasn't moved lately and it actually scales back
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.760]   The amount of polling it does on the network because it figures nobody's looking at me. Nobody's holding me
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.280]   I might as well slow down a little bit so they are trying to be more active
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   I'm not going to keep looking for Wi-Fi hotspots. I'm not moving around all that kind of stuff
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.880]   I really think that I mean I hold to what I was saying a couple weeks ago that
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.720]   Uh, this is I think the 5s and I with 7 are exciting things today
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.520]   But they're even going to be more exciting five or six months from now
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.000]   Both when the apps come out that are really optimized towards this hardware in this operating system
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.720]   And also when apple comes out with whatever they might be coming out with to really exploit that m7 co-processor
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.160]   Because that's right. I it's good that you're also holding up the mojo x
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.200]   I think that the two the two of the most exciting phones of the year
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.760]   Or the greatest features that I've never seen before
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:20.560]   Before 2013 are all due to an ability to have a processor that does nothing but maintain an awareness of what context
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.840]   What physical context is the phone and right now and the ability to say hey? I'm being taken out of a pocket
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:32.080]   I should do go into a slightly lower power mode right now that will just give someone a piece of information that will cause them to say
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.200]   Okay, no need to wake up the cpu. I can put this right in back my pocket now
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.640]   So that's this is I think there's going to be some exciting stuff coming in 2014
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:44.320]   So everybody in the chat room wants to talk about the the compass being off like is that a big deal?
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   No, it's it
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.840]   So the digital accomplices are never ever right there. They're always you know
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.680]   They've been terrible. You used to have to right fling your hand in a figure rate all the time
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:59.760]   The iphone 5s is consistently different than the previous iphones by about two degrees three degrees on the level
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.800]   And a few degrees on the compass, which is probably you know software
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:09.280]   Calibration fixable. It's just differently wrong than all the other that's bad though if you're using the level to hang pictures
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.240]   Because all your pictures will be tilted
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.480]   But as long as they're doing that
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.280]   Although although if if it helps at all
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.800]   The top and the side they're still a perfect right angle
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.520]   So if you want to use it as a try square when you're doing some framing it does work for that. Exactly
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.000]   Yeah, one thing I really love Leo is that they're doing this thing almost like just in time multitasking
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.480]   Because for a long time in computers, they would just multitask all the time and now they're getting so smart
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.800]   They can say oh Leo checks the news in the morning
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.840]   Yes, Leo doesn't care if we're on all the time or on two seconds before he picks it up as long as it's there when he picks us up
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.840]   There's a huge amount to be gained by by intelligent software and intelligence
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.480]   7 enables some of that stuff that we that has frustrated like Mike I have a Kindle
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.520]   And the physical Kindle you get the newspaper it is auto delivered over Wi-Fi in the morning
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   Duh so that if you walk out the door with your Kindle and get on the bus and there's no Wi-Fi
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:05.760]   It doesn't matter if the paper is there. Yeah, well now with iOS 7 that that's never been possible on the iPad of the iPhone for the Kindle
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:11.600]   Because it doesn't it's just an app it can't do that in the background and now with iOS 7
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.040]   They don't do it yet
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.240]   But I assume that Amazon will update it to do that and there you know
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.920]   All sorts of apps that you think like Insta paper a pocket does this right now
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.160]   Where if you add a story to pocket
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.680]   I love that the pocket app on iOS 7 automatically loads it
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.720]   You don't have to go there and wait for it to load in all the stuff you're saving
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.880]   It saves it if you walk out the door and lose your connection
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.400]   You got all the stuff so the Andy's exactly right in the next six months
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.160]   We're gonna see a lot of really cool apps that are enabled by the stuff that's in iOS 7
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.000]   Um, I did read and I thought this was great
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.160]   Of course, so this week was the second anniversary of the death of Steve Jobs at great loss
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.760]   And the New York Times ran what I hope will be the first in a long series of articles
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.920]   By one of the original iPhone designers about the behind the scenes
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.880]   If you haven't read it was in Sunday's Times
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.080]   Unbelievable fabulous
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.520]   And what it really underscored for me is how tough this was to do
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.720]   Uh golden path
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.120]   Just amazing and so here we are. It's only what six years later
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:20.000]   And uh, we we you know, I really ought to know what time I wake up
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.480]   For crying out loud
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.040]   The way he described I'm let me find the article because it's such a great article the way he describes
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.400]   Um, uh, you know just the issues
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:36.480]   The radios didn't work. Nothing worked. In fact, there was a what you said golden path. Is that what they called it?
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.000]   Yeah, you had to do everything in the precise order or the phone right there was crash
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.120]   There was a sequence because keep in mind that this is a cutting edge product the likes of which had never been seen before
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.360]   There are only six of them and they're demoing it six more than six months before it's done
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.640]   Right. I mean we've that that was that products
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.000]   I held one of those and I think Andy did too went and there were six of them
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.240]   It turns out and it worked
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:04.080]   But you know, they were ready to spring into action if you did anything wrong because they were I do remember that
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:11.200]   No, yeah, I was I was surprised me find the original because this is not the art of a show
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   Let's show the New York Times article. Let me find that anything that seemed particularly dangerous
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.280]   They had removed from the demo. I found my god
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.840]   The only the only thing that I tried to I was trying to remember what my experience
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.800]   I had about what half hour to 45 minutes in that room with them
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:32.000]   And I the only thing that I tried to use that it was not functional was the notes app because that right it was a screenshot
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.520]   It was just a screenshot
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.880]   But the thing was I think that they also didn't
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   The phone app also didn't work, but it wasn't as though I couldn't use the web
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.120]   It wasn't as though I couldn't drill down into apps
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:51.200]   So it was but but this is not the case of just somebody behind closed doors who they're already trusting to not be a bozo
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.960]   Sure, and see oh well the the hardware that I used six months before relief that was a little bit buggy and make a big issue of it
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.120]   but it's but the
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.640]   It really does impress you is how much how much was said to go wrong
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:09.520]   They even the one of the coolest takeaways of that article was that they had actually hard-coded the signal strength to always read five bars
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.200]   Because they did they did not want to take a risk at anybody would say oh well
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.400]   I was getting two and a half but two those with three bars in the middle of San Francisco
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:22.800]   snarky journalist sitting in the audience the whole radio subsystem would crash occasionally and so you would see it would reboot
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.960]   It would reboot you would see it lose all the bars
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.920]   And they were announcing this partnership with singular and they didn't want to defend so full credit here
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.880]   This is Fred Vogelstein who's a contributing editor at Wired
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.680]   And it is an excerpt from a book called dogfight how apple and google went to war and started revolution
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.440]   And so credit i'm going to read that book when it comes out great reporting
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.520]   He's uh, he's it's an interview with Andy green yon or green green yon
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:51.360]   who uh was uh one of the chief engineers of the radios inside the first
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.920]   iPhone
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:59.360]   Just and it talks about the it talks about the best part they were they were drinking in the audience as their
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:05.360]   Every time the demo worked yeah because as each engineer when his part cleared and was fine
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:11.760]   He would be handed the flask and he would take a drink. Yeah. Oh the the other the other cool thing was they knew that remember
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.680]   This was not like in town hall. This wasn't like 150 people. This was fourth
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.400]   Nagro knackeled expo. Yeah, right exactly and so they actually so they're trying to figure out
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:27.680]   How how are we going to be able to get content get access to wifi and make all this work with 5 000 people like in this noisy environment
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:34.960]   They wound up hacking their own code so that it appeared to the the airport base station to be a japanese phone
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.960]   Because because you could do channel you could do channel a higher channel
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.000]   Wi-Fi channels that aren't available and used in the us. Yeah, so crazy
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.280]   They probably had a pay like a 500 or 500. I find the FCC for that one
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:50.320]   But probably what probably money well spent by the end green yon wasn't just relieved. He was drunk
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.000]   He brought a he brought a flask of scotch to calm his nerves
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.960]   And so there we were in the fifth road or something engineers managers all of us doing shots of scotch
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.840]   You know meanwhile we're all sitting back in a little bit not noticing this
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.920]   Every segment of the demo there about five or six of us and after every piece of the demo
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.960]   The person was responsible for that portion did a shot
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:15.360]   They did not expect this to go flawlessly and by the way steve as we all know if something doesn't go flawlessly
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.680]   He'd say things like you're effing up my company
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.880]   He looked right at you during the rehearsals you're effing up my company on stage at mackerelle d'en New York
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.000]   He did uh, he took a digital camera that wasn't working and like literally flung it into the audience
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.120]   But let me get the takeaway from me from this
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:38.400]   Was if you don't have a steve jobs, you don't have an iphone because this what they were trying to do was so hard
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.880]   So impossible
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.760]   Everybody had told jobs you can't do this. We can't do this job said i don't want to do this
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.920]   I don't want to have to deal with phone companies
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.280]   But he literally i feel like muscled this through
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:58.000]   He welded into existence. He welded into existence and i don't know if any other company or any other guy could do this
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.720]   There are very maybe a jeff bezos. There are very few people who could say no
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.440]   I know it's impossible and we're still gonna do it
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:11.920]   And to have the restraint to not do it until it was close enough that the technology to make that phone existed because
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.280]   I was thinking about this they were talking about doing something that was more based on the ipod
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.360]   And I thought what would the world have been like if apple had come out with its first iphone in
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.680]   2004 and it had been based on the ipod and it had been using that pixel
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:25.680]   it would have been the motorbink of a rucker
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:32.560]   And and it would not have been a good experience and they they restrained themselves until 2007 when they were ready
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.480]   And I think about that you mentioned jeff bezos. I mean it's a question about something like the kindle
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:42.880]   Would the kindle I mean the kindle's done okay, but would they have benefited from having the restraint to say I know you're excited about this
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.600]   But it's not good enough wait. Let's wait two more years
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:52.160]   It's such a hard thing to argue that we're gonna stay out of the market and continue spending money building this product until it's ready
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   And that's but if you want to have one
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.960]   That's that's that's not quite the same thing though. I mean that what I
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.000]   Think that the ideal company has a mixture of both approaches
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.120]   I like the fact that people who are both not just early adopters, but early believers early people who have an early belief in
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:13.600]   Digital books or willing to spend close to four hundred dollars for any book reader with not a whole not a huge library of titles
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:20.080]   Uh, and they were the people who were able to just just like the owner of of teslas and and chevy vaults these days
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:27.280]   They are the people who enable the next establish the credibility so that when the next more practical device comes along more people can get on the
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.000]   Get on board and right now we've got a kindle exactly as good as the first one that cost 69 70 bucks
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.280]   So I'm not sure if if they had waited for it to be perfect
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.720]   They would have had a really beautiful $300 device that maybe would not have been able to compete in this market
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.160]   I'm not saying wait till be perfect, but I think that you can do damage to a product category if you come out with something bad
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.880]   I think the newton. Okay, although it was a good an interesting product did some damage to the handheld category
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.840]   And I bought the first kindle and I returned it. It was terrible
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.320]   I think they should have probably waited a year. I'm not saying wait till it's perfect the kindle still not perfect
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.200]   But I you know, I think I just wanted to use that as an example that I think the iphone story would have been very different
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   If they'd come up with a weird ipod based iphone two or three years earlier
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.440]   And I like that they waited and I think that's because steve jobs just you know
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.240]   He had that sense of timing and he knew what he wanted and it wasn't ready
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.640]   And this is not to deprecate the jubrillion engineers who created this thing
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.280]   But without a general to say we're going over that kill those engineers
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.440]   Don't do it without somebody who collects them into a body and and he was doing this
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.400]   He was taking people
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.720]   Done. I mean they were for them to do that that that required somebody to say I don't care
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.280]   We're gonna do multi-touch and you got it you got if you haven't read this article read this article
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:43.760]   It will give you a new appreciation a for what the iphone is for the revolution that it created and for the man who made it possible
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:50.320]   And I think there's no denying the it's amazing when you talk to the people who were involved at the time the combination of relentlessness and patience
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.960]   Like he would just wait and wait, but he wasn't sitting there waiting
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   He was forcing you to do better and better each time and he was willing to drive you that hard
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.000]   But wait for you to get there at the same time and that seems to have been a very good
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.640]   Combination you remember that picture that steve showed at the at the keynote
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.680]   He said we made an iphone it looks like this and uh and everybody laughed
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.080]   But it but what we're learning from this article is in fact
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.400]   It could have looked like that they were looking at an iphone using the dial
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.280]   Those are some of the early apple phone there were apple phone rumors
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.760]   And we see why as they were actually working on this stuff
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.040]   There were apple phone rumors for like five or ten years before the iphone came out
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:31.840]   And one of the strong rumors was this somebody obviously had gotten wind of a click wheel based right ipod phone
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.320]   Which would have been really weird, but
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.280]   model right the big disagreement between 20
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.480]   Tony was the designer the original guy behind the ipod
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   Right, and actually he said I want this to be an i-pod
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.520]   He thought it would be an extension of the ipod
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.760]   Who is the guy doing this with the i-watch? Is it is it uh johnny ive?
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:54.400]   Because you need that guy and i don't think it's tim cook bob man's field is it bob man's well?
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.520]   He's gone now isn't he or is he i don't think there's one guy right?
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.840]   It's the admit now, but you need that guy
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:05.040]   You need the guy who has the respect of the engineers to go in there and say you're f-ing up my company
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.080]   And instead of the guy saying well f you i'm out of here saying you're right steve
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.640]   I'm gonna work harder for you
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:20.400]   I think more I think more than that you need a leader who can absolutely convince the people who are pulling 90 hour weeks and are not
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:26.960]   Attending their kids recitals and their their soccer games that what you're doing is a really really important thing that the entire
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.640]   Company's future is based on this is not a world and i knew that we're playing with this is something
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:38.080]   We were actually making and we're either going to in your work will either lead to one of our greatest successes of 2014 or one of the reasons
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.120]   Why in 2015 we are not able to compete with other companies right now if you can do that
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.240]   That's that's we'll get a people to phone home and say i'm sorry
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.640]   Start dinner without me. I gotta work another three hours. I don't even think it's that i don't think it's the company
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.880]   I think you have to say you're gonna change what what steve said to john scullie you're gonna change the world
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.600]   Yeah, i'm not sure if that will work twice
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.720]   See not only that was it you'll you'll change the world but you'll change the world and look at this big truck full of money
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.480]   I don't know. I have to maybe it's just me
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.680]   But I think that the really good people are not motivated by bucks
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.560]   Not motivated by transforming the company
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.120]   But might be motivated by creating a product that changes the world that makes a huge difference
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:27.040]   That is the best to me. That's the best motivator and the best people are the ones who are going to be motivated by that
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   And that's the things you want. I think you're I think you're very very close. I think it's more like
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.240]   People want everybody wants to do something that matters
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:39.120]   Okay, it doesn't mean doesn't even have to be a revolutionary device that changes the entire planet
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.800]   It's where you create something that is has not been done yet that is that needs to have been made
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.680]   And that is an opportunity that you will not get in any other job at any other company
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:56.240]   You are here at apple right now with the resources of this incredibly creative company in this company that will take risks on
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.920]   Future forward thinking to do this one thing and maybe you were not going to be you're not going to still be at apple five years from now
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:10.320]   But the first generation watch or the first generation cable box or the first generation whatever they're working on will always be a landmark moment in history
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   And again, maybe
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.240]   How many people are still using their original ipods the original iphones now not many?
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.200]   So that the the the influence of that one product is certainly over and done with
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.960]   But it's important to believe that what you're doing right now right now matters and is important
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.840]   That's an opportunity that few companies can give you and apple is one of those few companies in tech right now
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:38.160]   And I hope that there's a guy who's who's who's there who's can can also motivate
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.240]   It's not enough to know that by the way, this is not
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.760]   Gonna change the world fox news
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   Shrinks humans
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:53.600]   Broadcast news is presented to the people and it's in the aware are giant
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:57.280]   This is the straight this of all the things that I saw
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:03.840]   When I was uh on this trip. It was this was the weirdest one. This is I thought that was a photoshop
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.280]   I honestly did I thought it was an onion. I thought it was the onion me too
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.520]   So this is fox news. What's his name?
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   Shepherd smith separate smith. Yeah, is getting a new show. It's not for all of fox news. It's just for shepherd
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:21.280]   Yeah, he's got it. This is their new set. They've built a new set and the set involves 55 inch
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:29.120]   Yeah, they're there what used to be surface. It's these microsoft windows base. Do we know that is it a giant microsoft touch screen
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:37.280]   Running windows eight. It is the most I feel so sorry for the people using this thing because well if you if you take a look at it
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.400]   It's 1080p. It's not uh 4k
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.280]   I mean so the twitter feed is huge
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.840]   And some guy has to sit like a foot away from it. There are four tweets on the screen
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.200]   I honestly think I don't see what you're talking about
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.360]   Look at this guy. This is crazy
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:59.200]   This a year from now if you visit like a friend like in the like who works like at fox in the studios
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   You will see like every third vehicle will have like a 58 inch display
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.840]   Because okay, we turned on that studio and whoever wanted one for 50 bucks. Just get it out of this video
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.320]   Let's live down this chain. I give it a month
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:16.560]   I give it a month. Yeah, the tab the tablet thing is it it's weird because they do look like tiny humans
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.200]   I mean I think that's a big problem there and by the way, these are actors
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.400]   I can promise you having been on many a network news set
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.920]   These are not real people
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:29.120]   They don't use real people because real people do things like pick their nose or get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of a broadcast
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.960]   These will be actors
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:36.880]   And so nobody's really going to be using these giant screens the people in the back using real computers with my secure board
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.840]   And by the way, this is my argument against touch computing in general
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.200]   If you really want to get work done
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.600]   Give me a keyboard and a mouse and a screen that's at arms lengthened this big because that's crazy
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.120]   So the part of this that I like and and Clayton Morris who's a really good guy
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.840]   He was talking about it and he's a co-worker of shepherd smith
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:58.320]   He said that that one of the things that it'll allow shepherd smith to do is sort of call up his own information
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.800]   Basically be his own producer his own director
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.320]   He gives a little demo of that
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.520]   But the people in the background, it's just so strange show this somewhere
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   It's ludicrous
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.880]   touchscreen computers any one of which we can put like an hour's minute
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.440]   That's exactly it
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.200]   It is so crazy and then he shows look at me. I got a tablet. There's a demo
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.280]   Coming up in a bit where shepherd shows how he
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:29.440]   Can manage the news using a simple device that looks oddly like a television remote control
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.080]   Wait a minute. Let me let me let's get to this here
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.440]   I don't know how anybody's gonna watch this and take this seriously
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:40.320]   But I and it has nothing to do with mac and touch but when I saw this I said this is this is crazy
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.600]   It can be running away
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.320]   This is television
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.440]   This is mainstream tv trying to be hip and cool
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.600]   Our brain wants to think that those are iPads
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.000]   Yeah, except then there's a guy
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.960]   Little apportion ipad. What are we seeing? Yeah, um, prob dignagian iPads from prob
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.160]   Whoa, they get a little gulliver's travel in there, huh? How to do it?
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.440]   Yep, little william defo. No, not william defo. That's the other guy
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:09.840]   Okay, wait watch watch shepherd's gonna use his is a piece of equipment that's been installed and never been
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:16.560]   A before but it allows me to manipulate this 30. It's a clicker long video. We call it the clicker
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.920]   For instance, I can take this picture and bring it over here
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.840]   Take this lady who's been evacuating from a hurricane zone and prove it over here
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.960]   She took that lady who's been evacuated from her career to and moved her right
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.840]   Look at that idea of what's happening in a certain area
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.080]   We'll use all of these all right. That's enough. That's show biz. It's show biz
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:40.560]   And and they say the reason they're doing it is because there's a whole new world of television viewers who don't watch linearly
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.800]   They're on twitter. They're doing this. They're doing that. Yeah, but then they're watching linearly a guy
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:50.080]   That's so flipping around by the way. I'm sure that premise really really follows. That's not who's watching fox news
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.320]   It's all the little old ladies who are gonna go
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.400]   Why are there's little people on t-fi?
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.600]   Yeah, it's just like they do this for the presidential elections, right where there's a big touchscreen
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.840]   Somebody's like or Jessica yelling on this
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.360]   And
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.960]   3d holograph she's just in the other room, you know, yeah and
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:13.120]   Jessica's and that's show biz show biz and not that we would ever do that
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.320]   It's kind of too bad though
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.920]   stepping back stepping back a little bit
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.960]   I mean wouldn't it be cool if they instead of having like the 5,000 fingers of missed of dr. T or whatever
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:29.120]   They had a like a four people with actual 4k screens where they can actually be creating
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:34.480]   Using them to their advantage where here's a large touchscreen, which is a huge surface in which if they got information
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.200]   They need to keep over there. They could access it then put it over there
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.520]   They could they keep pictures they keep video they have content they have access to pretty much whatever they want
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:48.560]   Wouldn't it be kind of interesting if that were in the background and people could see people using multi touch in a very effective and productive way for
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:53.680]   Time critical sort of stuff wouldn't that kind of have an influence on how people think about computing
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.200]   But of course, but as it is right now, it's just a stupid blown opportunity
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.640]   This is something you'd get like from the skymall catalog
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.760]   Right now. This is not a good ambassador for multi touch
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:09.600]   Shephard says leave we leave those glasses at home. You've got your
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.280]   Here at the studio shephard says we call these big area touch screens
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:22.480]   No, they call them big ass tablets. Yes, I want to say the word a s s on nightly news
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.760]   Wow
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.400]   All right, I had nothing to do with apple. I want to talk about OS 10 mavericks and a lot more
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.760]   You're watching back break weekly. Yes. I'm back in studio. Sorry do railing discussions once again
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.560]   Andy anaco from the chicago
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:40.880]   Renee richie from i'm more calm from mac world and pc world of course
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.440]   Mr. Jason snell hola when I will see if I go if I do it now
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   Hello's okay, but if I
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:54.320]   Chow if I do it now, is it gonna be an Italian? No, I know it's a giant that five and scream
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:00.400]   It knows that's a us. Uh, I gotta wait. I gotta wait until it's I don't do it now. Do it now. Do it happens
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.440]   It'll be in chinese. Wait, wait, okay. Okay. I'm gonna wait
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:10.080]   Hello, that's my language. Hold on do it. Do it really? Oh, see it didn't even let me ruin everything
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.200]   It always goes back to hello. It doesn't know i'm american. Yeah, yeah
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:18.880]   I don't I have to say if you do the iOS 7 up get her if you haven't done it and you're doing it to existing material to existing
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   Oh good. Let's do an Arabic. Oh
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.480]   You have you do have to and this is very frustrating. It's as if it's a brand new
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:29.200]   Hard not always no not always it did on all my stuff. I too didn't do that to me
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:35.840]   Yeah, it doesn't know no no no no no the first time it goes to iOS 7. It does that not 7.0.0.2
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.000]   Right, but when you but i'm just saying if you're going from six to seven be prepared because you're
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.800]   Basically going to be having a brand new machine in effect. You've got to do no no no
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.600]   No, no authentic authentication. I mean if apps are apps and data that are in place will remain in place. No
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:55.200]   Yes, yeah, but you have to go through a whole bunch of stuff to get it going again
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.320]   It's not as owners you have to you have to sign in you have to reestablish that
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.000]   The reconnect really that the to your to your iTunes store account
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.560]   And also reaffirm that yes, I do want I do want location services to be turned on. Yes
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.160]   I do want this this other service to be turned on it wasn't bad also
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.280]   Maybe this is not if when you think about it
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:20.000]   Maybe it's kind of okay that your first introduction to iOS is not a boom here is uh, here is your operating system for your phone
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.480]   It is we're gonna walk you through some screens. We're gonna sort of desensitize you to this these
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.200]   This new font and this new color scheme
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:34.240]   We will try to get you to not freak out by the fact that the next button is not a button that is a highlighted and and and shadow
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:39.520]   It is actually just the word next in the upper right hand corner of the screen one thing I do would I do appreciate and although
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   I don't know if everybody appreciate this is
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:48.240]   Uniformly everybody who gets a new iOS 7 device has to create a password code, right? You cannot skip I can't skip this step
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:55.840]   You you have to create a new passcode. Oh wait, no there it says don't add passcode, but it's in little you know you're strongly encouraged
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.760]   Strong and I think that's probably good, right?
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.960]   Yep, you can turn off locking if you don't want to do that
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.280]   But um, I think that that's a nice pro security step
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:10.960]   All right, so you're right. It's not it's not uh, it wasn't too bad. I was able to do it while I was talking
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:18.480]   It does tell you the spotlight has moved. That's probably the single biggest point of confusion. You can't swipe left anymore. You have to just kind of
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.040]   I think that's mistake people
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.760]   And people are why things I think are mistakes as well. Sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, I'm sorry
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.080]   No, they miss their tweet and facebook buttons on notifications. That's the biggest complaint I've been getting really
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.200]   Yeah, I I never thought they belong there, but apparently once you give someone something taking it away is bad
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.640]   Huh
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.160]   Interesting
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.160]   All right, we're gonna take a break
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.040]   And come back we can talk more about that if you wish we could talk about other things of course
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.800]   And the new johnny. I've like a camera

[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.120]   I the thing you really spend a lot of money on a like is you want to look like a likea
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.560]   Mmm, but few there's only one of them and only you can have it. It is your friends from having it. There's only one, huh
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:30.000]   Wasn't it one off? I want to bang my inner. Oh, I know why i'm using chrome. Let me go back to safari
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.120]   I use chrome on the trip, but I don't want to use chrome anymore on this. Do you find that I
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:41.840]   Max don't work well with chrome. No, I know a lot of mac users who really like it doesn't work for me for so I prefer it
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.200]   It's it's my my mac got so much more stable when I switch to chrome is my primary. I suppose to safari
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.920]   Really? I use safari, but I use chrome as my backup
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:54.080]   Ah, it's just me then if sorry there it is. Oh, that's pretty
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.120]   What a johnny dude is different actually looks like a likea
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.000]   Oh, it's got uh
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   texture
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.040]   aluminium aluminium and texture
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:11.200]   But you don't what you don't know is that that entire camera including the lens is actually milled out of a single block of aluminum
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:17.680]   It so the it actually kind of looks like maybe a mac pro with the little cheese grater laser
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:23.280]   Laser machined aluminum body and anodized aluminum shell. Oh, that is pretty once they're lasers and aluminum
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:27.680]   That is uh, if johnny, I have wherever to be a james bond super villain and it's to benefit
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.960]   Product red and some aluminium and how much so the deal is it's just as an auction
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:39.760]   Or do you have or what's the deal? Anybody know auction? I'm yeah, if I blew it to one off, isn't it?
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.800]   But how do I get it? Oh, it isn't I think it is an auction. Oh, that's pretty
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.840]   You know what johnny's got chops
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.600]   The dude can do it. He's very employable
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:59.040]   Anybody ever wants a good designer. I can highly recommend sir johnny eyes sir johnny
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:07.760]   It's something something occurred to me that when when prince charles like was uh, like got his title
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.280]   They they they made for him this very 1960s design crown
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.880]   And so we're probably gonna you know, we're gonna we're gonna see like
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:21.200]   The next generation needed to crown what if they got johnny? I have to design an actual like crown for the next king
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.840]   I
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.600]   We've reimagined
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:33.440]   What a crown could be so it is the lightest crown ever made shaving over 18 pounds given that we're no longer stealing jewels from our former
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.440]   It'll be auctioned at saucybe's November 13th to raise money for
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:44.320]   product product product red the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.280]   I thought I said marijuana, but it's malaria
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.880]   Uh, oh wow 561 of them
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:59.520]   Neuliah thaw total 561 models and nearly a thousand prototypes to create one camera and bono has already praised it
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:04.800]   That's pretty cool
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:08.960]   So we don't know what it's gonna go for but if you want to get it go to saucybe's on uh,
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.400]   November 23rd just my point out my birthday is November 29
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:16.320]   Bring your checkbook. What do you get for a guy who has anything?
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.200]   Everything you get him a johnny eye of lyca
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:25.440]   OS 10 maverick's solid gold baby. We're talking the gold master
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.720]   Um, it's out for developers
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.200]   Yeah, that means it's coming soon any day now. What do you think? What's your bit? What's your prediction?
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:39.120]   That's by the way, that's five days ago came out. So yeah, I'm still catching up you understand
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.840]   Um
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:47.120]   Ships with mac pro you think yeah, I figure apples event now. Do they did they slipstream new?
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.480]   I'm act somebody told me that yeah, they knew I knew uh, I'm act speed bumps that are with mountain lion
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:58.720]   Okay with mountain lion with mountain lion so uh, they didn't wait for mavericks for those but to me when I heard that
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:06.720]   It sounded like they were clearing the decks for a because last year remember they had updated everything that they hadn't updated which means everything but the iphone
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.680]   And this big october announcement on october 23rd
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:15.440]   So that means they're not going to do that or they wanted to give iMac big deal not a big deal. We want to do mac pro
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.400]   Haswell mac books
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.400]   And a retina ipad mini
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:27.440]   Maybe if they if they do the max and the ipad together which they might not I mean the mac pro is such a strange product that they could
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:35.120]   They could do a small event or no event at all and and do that then I mean that's the question do they want to mix to mac with the ipad
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:40.080]   They made so much. They've been buying ads and movie theaters for the mac pro. This is not a small thing
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:44.000]   But but also it depends on what kind of message they want to send for the innovate my ass
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.640]   Exactly. That's exactly what i'm getting out of me. It's a really weird super super powerful
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.680]   It is a velocity cannon of does in both physical form and in processing power
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.320]   And if they want to simply say oh and uh, we have a mac our map of gears which look much
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.560]   Our mac books look much like that in last year
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   But they knew processors and we have a new this that the other that the new
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:09.760]   New ipad that looks much the same only we have a new better processor if they can say oh and by the way
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.440]   Here is our velocity ion cannon computer of a desktop
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:19.840]   I want it. I just the name pray we do not alter our bargain further
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.200]   What okay, rene richie rumor master. What have you heard?
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:32.960]   I thought it was awfully quiet there in montreal rene has been uh constrained by the
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.600]   Canadian government from speaking
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.280]   Go ahead. No you muted rene rene rene did you sit on something?
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.960]   Sorry
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:49.680]   I was being preventive no I mean the new ipad I think is going to be a big deal because it gets the new casing design
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:54.800]   It's going to be lighter. It's going to have smaller bezels. It's going to look different and when apple makes products look different
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:00.000]   Um, usually they're much they get much more attention than when they just spec bump them internally
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.760]   You know it's the tick to the tick tock cycle gets them all the excitement and then the mac pro is going to be a huge deal too
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:13.200]   Just because it's exactly what Andy said it's apple showing that they can make the hypercar still that they can do the big amazing thing in technology
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.920]   So if you have an october event that has the ipad 5 the retina ipad mini
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:24.400]   And the mac pro and by the way where has well bumping, you know the rest of the lineup. I think that's a really exciting event
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:28.720]   Is uh, is it possible they won't have an event this year?
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:33.840]   No, I think they'll definitely have an event I my skepticism is only about the
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.280]   um
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:41.120]   The mac pro and whether they do it as a part of that event or they do another little mac pro something in november
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.400]   Mac pro is much less of a holiday season kind of product
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.800]   So they could put it off it doesn't mean they will necessarily but they could put it off
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.720]   But I think they said it would be out this year
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:56.080]   iPod touched it out this year but again, it's not a holiday. They don't need to fill the channel for the holiday
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.000]   They're not going to announce it December 31st
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.920]   No, but they could do it they could do it in november or even december if they wanted a third event
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.160]   Maybe but or they could pack it all in in uh in late october
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.960]   Depends on how much of our money they want to report in the holiday quarter
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:15.680]   It does feel like a good thing to put on stage given that they're going to have a lot of new tools and a lot of production stuff
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.520]   That has never been seen before I think that the mac pro is going to demo really really well
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.880]   If you think about the sort of companies they will invite on stage
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:27.040]   It's a we gave mac pro's to a few selected developers to see how they could
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:31.760]   They could make best use of the exciting new possibilities of it and here is our you know
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:38.640]   Is our liaison for the nsa who can knows who can i do keyword searches on a hundred thousand phone calls a second instead of just ten?
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   Well, mavericks they can make a big deal about mavericks too, right? They can say here's mavericks. It's great. Here's the mac pro
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:50.400]   It's great. This is you know, we've also speed bumped these other things the retina macbook pro is so great
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.600]   And then you know whether they do that and then also pivot
[00:59:53.600 --> 01:00:00.160]   Ooh pivot that's an exciting word and say we're going to talk about the new ipads too or whether they kind of like do that in separate chapters
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:04.160]   Uh, there's certainly a lot to talk about right is final cup pro worth a demo
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.640]   Or is it just going to be you know made aware for the mac pro?
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.440]   I mean if they've got new versions of their pro tools they probably want to show them off
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.360]   But if they're just made to work with the mac pro then it's not as big a demo
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:18.640]   But they're going to want to show off the power of the mac pro and that means they're going to need to do software demos
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.840]   So that may be where something like final cut comes out
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.640]   Just because they've already boasted that the final cut stuff is going to be so much better on the new mac pro
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.840]   And so if that's the case then they're going to want to do the demo just to just to show off the power of the mac pro
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.840]   Because a lot of apps are not going to look that different on the new mac pro
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.400]   You're going to want the ones that really take advantage of it
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.040]   Well, you know what my conspiracy theory is is they're going to bundle pro apps on this new mac pro
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.080]   Right so they'll have
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.960]   That's your exactly right final cut pro. They did just update logic. So that's not
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.280]   Right, but they could still demo it. I mean it's not necessarily an announcement so much is just showcasing all the pro
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.920]   This is this is a pro app
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.800]   And I work hardware with pro apps and it's all bundled. I think that makes sense to me
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.880]   But we'll see they have new version of iWork apps finally. What was the last one Jason? I work 99
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.120]   No, well, they'll be also have iWork in the cloud
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.520]   No, no, no, no, no, no, yes, but
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:24.160]   9783 iWork Apple works Apple works. No, iWork 09 is my current. Yeah, it's timely as the days headlines
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.240]   I work good. It's fine
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.040]   You know what they're going to do though is they're going to focus on i'd predict just as Microsoft has on the online
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.760]   Portion of this right and they're and they've done that
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.160]   I mean they got their web apps and they've got their iOS apps
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.120]   But the the mac apps could probably stand a refresh maybe
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.680]   Yeah, we'll say four k-dis plays leo you know apple branded four k-dis plays with any mac pro
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.200]   Well, you did see that they hired Jean-Francois mule
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.160]   Hola hola. Hola. He is a he's from cable labs
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.680]   Where he was uh, I was with the cable card people senior vice president of technology development
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.120]   Why would you hire a guy like that to head an unnamed?
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:06.240]   Engineering project something big think that would be a tv related project
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.160]   You think it's gonna be a set up
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.240]   I agree with Renee though that that new mac pro you really want to see a uh
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:19.120]   A retina or 4k or both display as a part of that story
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.120]   Can they make something a retina display that big?
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:28.240]   Well, the 4k is not written the display which is might be an easy out for them because they couldn't do it with the iMac
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:33.600]   And the iMacs usually get it first but 4k the like 2160p is not what a retina
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.440]   27 screen would really work out too. So it's sort of a an easy out
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:43.120]   Are there uh, I mean, I know you can buy TVs at 4k TVs, but they're pretty well. Wait, no is there's a cheap one though
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.920]   There's like a thousand 18 dollar one. Yeah, it goes
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.560]   It's really cheap one but they're gonna go to 30
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:53.840]   Refresh for only 30 and the HDMI has to be updated doesn't support it. You'd have to get the new HDMI
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.080]   Although I presume this mac pro will support that
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:02.880]   Yeah, and I really I really don't think that any that the mac pro is going to be targeted to anybody who is looking to pinch pennies anywhere
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.720]   So I think I
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.160]   I'm sorry. I mean that that's where if you want the if they do come up the 4k display for an apple branded 4k display
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.560]   There that bezel let that housing's gonna cost a lot of money to produce because it
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:21.360]   People are gonna be wanting to buy a premium product with no compromises about it. Here's this is the sakey 50 inch 4k
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.200]   for
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.280]   Under a thousand bucks now obviously this is a panel that apples not would never sell
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:35.600]   But maybe there's somebody making this panel at a higher quality with imagine rene's right imagine a 27 inch 4k display thunderbolt display essentially
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:40.480]   Um, I'd buy that and that'll cost what is the thunderbolt display cost? I mean, that's a that's a what?
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.320]   $1,000 no, it's a thousand. That's a thousand no. No, I mean the 4k
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.000]   So make a two thousand you already spent five grand on the mac pro. Yeah, and you get the free the free
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.160]   That's why you want the free final cut 10 sure just throw it in there
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:04:02.000]   Throw it in the software just because you're such a nice because I know how I was in the grand bizarre in Istanbul
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.960]   I know exactly how this works. Yeah, take out picture take a lot of
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:11.920]   Aputure how much would you have some tea while we do while we sit and discuss this new monitor your body by the way
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.240]   DHL is gonna come with a bunch of boxes in a few days
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.200]   I fell for it
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:29.440]   Do you really do you really think 27 inches? I I would imagine that again, hi expensive premium product people who really want to be impressed with a
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:35.740]   Harge display something that really shows off. Oh, I can't I would never be able to appreciate that level of detail 30
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:39.980]   On any sort of things 38 42. I've heard rumors over 30
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:46.700]   But I never know what the TV rumors because they're all just so so many of them. Yeah, but it's always this the apple TV
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:50.060]   No, but it's a no, but it depends on what they want to do right
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:53.980]   They could do a smaller one and call it retina and say it's true retina on the desktop
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:59.420]   Or they could do a bigger one and just say it's 4k and touch you know make it make it easier for
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.420]   I don't think so no
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:06.140]   The problem with the rumors about the television is every time someone has said, you know, it's always the same person
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:10.860]   There's gonna be an apple television. It's like the first rumor about it. It ended up being a 27 inch iMac
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:16.220]   So for apple they're working on that panel and you know just being a 4k panel does not mean at all a television set
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:20.780]   But because you say 4k it sounds to a lot of people like oh apple's working on a television set again, right
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:28.060]   I want to see an event. I know you're going to Ireland, but I want to see an event this month. Yeah, oh sure
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:30.060]   Just don't do it. You come back
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:35.500]   If if they do with the event next week, I will not I'll cancel my plans probably so please make it the week after
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.780]   But if it's the if it's the if it's the
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:45.340]   22nd would that be okay? Yeah, okay. I think we would know by now. We would have invitation and this is Tim
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:53.340]   Hey, Tim. Hey, Jason. I just want to say roll time and come home. You know, I watched the I watched the original iPhone
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:57.820]   Keynote this weekend. Oh, me too. Isn't that something after reading that New York Times article
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:02.380]   And it is a thing to behold especially now. I know that the engineers were getting drunk in the fifth row
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:09.260]   Finest out but the part that killed me is that one of the first sample phone calls is from Tim and it's hey, Steve. This is Tim
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:13.900]   Is this the one we call Starbucks and orders coffee for the yeah, yeah
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.540]   And now we call the sushi restaurant
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:20.140]   I don't want to talk to them and now we know that the engineer said no don't make a call Steve
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:27.740]   Please don't make a call that was the thing that was almost certain to crash it and they went through many many rehearsals in a crashed every single time
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.300]   And they had they had Phil Schiller out in the audience
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:34.460]   And they were they had to fight with the uh like the feedback that they were giving over
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:39.520]   He's like holding the phone like this trying to keep the feedback out and jonnie was so happy to talk to stahat
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.220]   Hi, you hi just so happy. Yeah
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:46.300]   Yeah, it's great theater demos crash every time on shipping products
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:52.940]   Steve jobs can demo like those things doesn't work at all makes a call bill gates boots up as four-year-old version of windows and it crashes so unfair
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:55.740]   It's like the grateful dead
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:03.100]   You go to a grateful dead concert after grateful dead concert and then suddenly you realize you were at the concert 1977
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:06.540]   In upstate new york that everybody agrees with the best concert ever
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:10.380]   We were at I think I have to say I I think there's no question in my mind
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:14.140]   Not only steve jobs finest hour, but there will never be a keynote
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:20.620]   A demo as good as that ever again. That was it. It's the definitive fact that was the grateful dead 1972
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:26.060]   Well, I I think that the iphone keynote and the ipad keynote were like
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:30.540]   Sergeant pepper and revolver. Okay. It's like once you've got those two
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:34.460]   That's the those are there there the two best for two different reasons
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:40.220]   But they're both for the same reason of you see a man who is one of the most powerful people in the world
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.620]   When the richest man the world, but he is like a 14 year old kid showing off this
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.740]   Awesome action figure that he got
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:53.340]   I'm going to put a word in for the for the original ipad event, which was at the town hall a little theater
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:57.820]   I was at that event and that was not a guy at the top of this game, right?
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:02.700]   I was I was I was watching this guy, you know, and we're like, okay steve try to prove this to us
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.620]   Like there was huge skepticism
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:08.780]   Really apple's gonna do a music player and steve jobs had to do full salesman like let me explain
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:13.500]   Why we even bothered to do that with the iphone? It's like hey, we're apple. We're gonna do crazy stuff like this
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:18.780]   That was that was like the Beatles and shay stadium. It was the beginning you knew there's please please me
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.540]   please so
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:23.900]   Did kutura nail that in the movie because that's how the Ashton kutura
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.460]   No, and it's not and it's not actually that event
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:31.020]   It's like some event that may or may not have happened that was to the to the inner people who worked at apple
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.020]   Yeah, it wasn't the same
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:38.700]   I haven't my pocket. He said it was a great. Yeah, but they're you know, they were trying to prove something and the iphone
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:43.260]   He was and he's exactly right top of his game. It was cenatra at the sand. Yeah
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.420]   Yeah, master of his craft at the height of his powers
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:50.860]   And also with with 4,000 people who knew that something amazing was going to happen
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.900]   Oh, I'm sitting there with scott born who could prat it was actually floating
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.620]   Off of his throw as his palm trio on the floor
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.380]   Isn't that the urban legend was it was scott?
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:06.060]   Alex lindsey. I was mr. Lin there. I can't remember but it was the original mac break weekly crew were sitting in a row
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:11.740]   And I will never forget and when he goes it's an iphone. It's an internet you get it
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.540]   And it I mean it was like
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:19.260]   My brain
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.900]   Um
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:25.660]   What else what else anything else we want to talk about before we move on to the picks of the week
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:28.700]   Oh retina retina ipad mini is that possible?
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.420]   Renee you've been poo pooing it
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:34.380]   No, it's not that i'm poo pooing it. It's that it's a non trivial thing
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:37.660]   And I know when like when the next the seven came out everyone said well if google can do it
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:42.780]   Why can't apple and you have to look very carefully and see that uh retina next to seven has you know only
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:46.860]   75 of the pixels and gets only seven hours compared to ten hours of battery life
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:50.380]   Apples had a prototype for the retina ipad mini for almost a year
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:53.420]   But they're not going to release it till it has ten hours of battery life
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.540]   And that's not you know, that's not easy to do previously
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:10:00.620]   You could have retina you could have lightness or you could have battery life and you get to pick two of them
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:04.060]   So the big ipad had battery life and retina but no lightness
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.580]   The mini had lightness and battery life but no retina and now it sounds like they finally got both the ipad
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:15.260]   Five with you know the big screen and it's much lighter now and the ipad mini and it's got retina now
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:20.700]   So there might be constraints like there were with any new iphone because retina is really really hard to do
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.020]   But it sounds like they've gotten there
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.380]   Analysts at kennicord genuity
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:30.060]   I think they should change your name. That's a really bad name between us
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:37.340]   Says that the iphone five s is outselling the galaxy s4 at both at and t and sprint in fact
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:43.100]   The iphone five c is also outselling the galaxy s4
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:51.740]   I no question I guess assuming this analyst is rec is correct and I see no reason not to think so that
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:56.940]   The iphone they did apples done it again. It's told nine million the first weekend while you're gone Leo
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:00.140]   Really? Is that the number? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, holy
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.580]   Come only but this but this is the same reason why we also ignore
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:10.220]   The numbers about how badly the iphone was being outsold right during the first week of uh of samson's ley's phone
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.900]   But I mean it's there they're two very different phones to very different markets
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.540]   Uh, but yeah, I mean there's there's there's nothing
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:21.100]   And you were even it was even kind of hard to find with the usual
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.620]   Doubting thomas is in a certain from certain
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:30.460]   Publications uh saying did I that the iphone five s was anything less than a complete success?
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.780]   Did they break apart? I'm looking at the press release. Did they break it down between s and c or no?
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.700]   So it's nine million total
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.820]   But they wait every year they report the total amount and every year they have three models
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:44.540]   Does anybody have any insight into the success of the c is I mean, it's never been out of stock
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:50.460]   And maybe that's because it's easier to make. I don't know. Yeah, well, I mean they're already ramped up from the iphone five and it's the same stuff
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.580]   Same stuff in the five
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.660]   It's way easier to make and they meant it to be a lot
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.580]   It's not supposed to be the iphone that people line up for it
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.260]   It's supposed to be the colorful one on the shelf that you walk into the store for months and months to come
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:04.380]   Right, I just want to buy it. So uh presumably it's selling as well as the s
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:10.780]   Yeah, well, I don't know because there's there's this peak of all the frenzied people who are like really excited about the s
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:14.300]   And those are the people who wait in line and it's all of us tech nerds who are getting the s
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.660]   I think the c
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:19.100]   I hear people talking about it. I hear people getting it for the kids in the long run
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:23.580]   I think the c is going to sell better than yes, but in the short run you've got this frenzy about the s
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.140]   And so that's probably sold better so far. Yes, l's
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:29.260]   Get let's get through the holidays and the c is going to be
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:32.140]   The uh, bananas. Yeah, come on. I agree. I agree 100%
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:36.460]   I think I think people are going people who walk into the store in january february march
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:40.060]   They're going to see oh wow. It's $100 less. Oh wow
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:45.340]   It's available in these really cool colors. Wow and it's run the and to when they hold them both in their hands
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.980]   They're going to see the same phone running the same operating system
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:51.820]   And I think that most people are going to go for their five c and they'll go for the five s
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:56.700]   If they have a reason to go for the five s we were talking about how fast the the five s is
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:03.100]   But the it's not as big a difference between the five and the five s or the five c and the five s as it was between the four s and the five
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.100]   So when you're talking about somebody upgrading they're on a two-year contract. They're just coming off
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:12.460]   They've got a four s and then and now leo is licking his i'm just i'm curious if the if my tongue
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:15.260]   Can i can i get my tongue
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.260]   My point is the people who are upgrading
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:22.060]   Um from the four s the five c is going to be so much faster than the four s
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:26.860]   That you know, they're not going to feel that it's a compromise and you're right packaging is packaged like an ipod
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:30.620]   They want you to see the color and they want it to be there very visual for you
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:33.500]   Yeah, and it's also down at 49 now at
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.820]   By in walmart. Yeah, so it's uh, it's going to be perceived as this value phone
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:39.900]   They're going to sell a lot of them a lot of them
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:45.980]   Yeah, even the five c even has that the the ios sticker on the front of it makes it look like it's running ios
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:49.340]   So now i've got like a fourth like a window decal on my
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:53.580]   And those for those weren't things you'd see on the iphone. Yeah
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:59.980]   Cool. All right. It's it's not a less expensive iphone. It's a pop iphone. Yeah. No, there are a lot of people who seem to
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:04.540]   Believers really in the sea after they held it. They said, you know what?
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:08.780]   This is pretty sweet, you know, if this morning I had the exact same experience
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.180]   I always have whenever I hand the the five seed to someone who has never held one before they are shocked
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:16.140]   It feels so solid. They it's they're shocked it feels so good because
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:21.660]   To the the meme is that this is the cheap to produce plastic iphone as like no, what is it?
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:27.340]   It is it is happens made may have a plastic it costs $99, but it is a premium phone sold for 99 bucks
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.340]   Yeah
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:33.820]   Apple's never been in the business of making the super cheap thing that everybody mean even when you said all those
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.900]   You saw
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:39.740]   The that the you know apple's not gonna replace most of the people who just want to have phone
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:42.220]   You know those those are gonna be android phones not this
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:46.940]   iPod socks were phenomenal. Are you training it to recognize your tongue now? I don't think it's gonna work
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.500]   Hard to get him on kiddies feet though
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:53.500]   You're fogging up the screen something awful there
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:58.860]   Right no you just you just turned a dot red, you know that leo
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:03.020]   It's a bad idea
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.100]   It won't it won't get more rules
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:09.340]   No
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.340]   Chatham said it will work
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.900]   It doesn't work with moisture the surface is wet it won't work. Oh
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.940]   Oops, it was it'll work with your toes
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.340]   Was this just a ploy to make sure that no one else would try to try to take your iphone five
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.820]   Yeah, I've looked at now you can't have it
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:28.060]   Belongs to you now. It's mine. I've put my DNA all over it
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:30.780]   uh, let's uh, let's uh
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.900]   Okay, last call any other stories that we should be talking. I'm really I'm sorry
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:39.420]   I apologize, but I just really feel like I've been out of touch and anything I missed. Nope. This was fun
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:41.340]   I think we got it all. Yeah
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:43.340]   I think we've got it all
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.500]   Um, it somebody says it works with nipples
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:50.380]   Yes, one surprise skin. Yeah, any any anatomy with a pattern on it you can use
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:53.100]   I think unlocking it with your nipple would be inconvenient
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.420]   You can use your pit ball if you want
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:57.980]   My what your pit ball your dog your cat
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:00.860]   Never call in a pit ball before is that what you call it?
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.580]   We're gonna take a break
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:09.340]   And no, let's not let's just go on. Let's go on. Let's not stop. I'd like to stop. I wish I could stop
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:15.260]   But I can't we have no more commercials. So let's get our tip our uh products of the week
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:18.140]   And who shall I start with?
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.380]   Any, any more?
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:23.900]   I think we'll start with rene richy today your your tip your product of the week sir
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.580]   I have to the first one
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:29.580]   You know, Jason mentioned at the top of the show that we're gonna be at the singleton symposium in montreal
[01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:36.540]   And even though I live in montreal I don't live in that part of montreal which means i'm gonna be at a hotel for long stretches of time
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:40.940]   And the iphone battery it's not a razor max. It's not one of those giant, you know things
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:46.380]   So what I do is I I bought these last year. I bought two of them. It's the mophie juice pack
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:52.700]   And it's the duo that's so it's got two usb so there's one for me and one for a wayward american friend
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:56.300]   Just visiting montreal who didn't know that we have the same power outlets that they do
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:03.420]   Really it's american in the command of the yeah, we use the same power different money same power
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:04.700]   Um
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:10.380]   So this is great. It'll recharge an iphone twice. It'll also charge an ipad so I have two of these with me
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:16.780]   And I've also got I saw this at ces and I didn't get one for a while, but I finally picked one up
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:20.780]   It's the element case for the ipad mini and I'll hold it further away
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:25.820]   And it's it's not a smart cover, but it's made with their typical, you know, sort of
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:29.980]   Uh race car stylings and it holds the ipad mini very well
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:35.740]   It's got a nice interior. It's got a flap on the inside so that you can set it up like a stand
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:40.940]   Um, and if you want something that protects the back as well as the front
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:42.460]   You know, some people get a lot of scratches on it
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:46.140]   They don't like the millennium falcon chic that others of us enjoy
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:52.220]   It's just a very nice very solid very well made case for the ipad mini very cool
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.980]   Element case. Yeah, jacie snell your pick of the week
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.940]   Uh one password for came out
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.540]   Oh
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:05.340]   From agile bits agile bits dot com. Yes
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:09.180]   It's a paid upgrade or if you've never bought it
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.340]   It's you know, spend the money on it. It is even with maverick's coming out with some
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:18.140]   Password memory kind of stuff. This is my preferred way of storing all my passwords
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:23.100]   You have one master password. It locks all your other website passwords away
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.540]   You don't have to remember them. You just have to remember the the web master password
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:31.260]   Sinks with iphone syncs with ipad works with dropbox if you're on some random computer somewhere
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:36.220]   You can actually get there's an html file hidden inside that you can launch and it's like a web app
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:42.540]   Really versatile. Um, it'll generate random passwords for you. You can put your credit cards in there
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:48.380]   You can put your passport number in there. It's all strongly encrypted and really I don't go anywhere without it
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.180]   Now that's where I keep all those numbers that I can't memorize. So
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:56.940]   um, even with uh maverick's coming out with much better support the iCloud keychain stuff. I really
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:03.100]   Um, it works with browser plugins. It's really great. So one password is my choice for staying secure
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:08.460]   You don't want to use the same password on every website because if it gets cracked in one place suddenly you're completely
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.260]   Yes
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:09.900]   insecure
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:16.540]   So what you want is different random passwords on all your different sites and then lock it all up with the one password that you use on your
[01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:18.540]   Mac or your iphone
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:20.780]   Great product. Love it. Yeah, I love it too
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:22.940]   Andy cannot go your pick of the week
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:29.020]   Uh, this is the click desk stand by the joy factory for the ipad
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:34.060]   Uh really nice sturdy the joy festant really the joy factory exactly well
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:39.020]   Apparently, this is what joy looks like if there's joy missing from your life look around the house to see something like this
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:43.820]   Yeah, uh or look at the rest of the stuff that got on the catalog. Maybe you have you've had it laying around
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.700]   You just didn't know what to call it. Hey, that looks like something I saw in fox news
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:54.300]   Only exactly it's like for this giant imagine imagine like fox news for squirrels
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:20:08.060]   So back back to the pick of the week, um, it's if you're using like your your ipad for like home use
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:10.860]   It's obviously really good if you're using it like on the desktop
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:18.380]   For like typing it's has a so but also i've been i have my older ipad in this because i've been using it
[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:22.780]   In my living room as a source for uh for streaming to my apple tv
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:27.180]   That has two really good features of it number one this mount on the back of it
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:32.140]   Which allows you to rotate it pretty much like you have it on the coffee table then rotate it all the way up
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:35.420]   So you can be like looking down as you do it or just put a drink on top of it
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:39.100]   Which you shouldn't do but you could do it, uh, and also you can rotate it
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:45.340]   Portrait and landscape, but the other nice thing about it is that he said trying to drop his ipad
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:51.020]   This actually removes completely leaving behind just a simple not not terribly thin
[01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:57.740]   But useful shell on your ipad so that number one you can actually go to the website and buy other
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:01.740]   Are these little mounts so that you can i can take this out from the living room
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:05.580]   And then click it into a mount that's i've screwed into like a kitchen cabinet
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:08.220]   And i use this in the kitchen like for for food network stuff
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:09.900]   Uh or
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:14.620]   Because they've left this area this the smart to cover hinge exposed
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.740]   You can actually take it out then take it into the car and take it into the work for you
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:21.980]   With you and just put your smart cover right back on it. So, um, it's not terribly cheap
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.980]   It's 59.99
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:28.780]   Uh, but it's one of the few table stops tans table top stands
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:31.740]   I've seen that is good for a number of different uses
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:40.540]   That doesn't turn basically lock your ipad into now suddenly only being a desk mounted or cabinet mounted or table mounted, uh ipad
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.580]   Cool that's neat. I have an ipad stand too
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.420]   But before I do that, I want to do an anti-pick
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:50.380]   I blew the fuse in every hotel room i checked into and the ship
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:54.460]   You were real popular
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:58.140]   Lisa couldn't believe it. She said you did it again. I said yes
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:04.060]   And the reason is I kept plugging this in it's a from trip light. It's a mobile surge protector
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:07.900]   I thought this was going to be great. You know I had an adapter for it. It's a three prong plug
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:11.820]   But of course in in europe they use those two prong plugs i plugged it in
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:16.140]   I should have looked more careful. I mean it says it's a tr it says it calls it a travel
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:20.780]   adapter i'd maybe even you recommended this any i can't remember but that wasn't me
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:25.580]   Yeah, you're right not to because it's only 110 it is not 220
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:28.140]   So every time I plug this in
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.140]   Power surge into it
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:36.940]   And for some reason their giant sparks would fly and then the room would go dark and I would have to embarrassly call the front desk
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:40.060]   the world's old the oldest hotel and say um
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:43.260]   Scoozy
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:45.260]   El power o out o
[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:49.020]   And uh, fortunately they were very kind about it, but this don't bring this with you
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:54.380]   It says it works in us in canada. So you can take it to uh montreal with you nice, but nowhere else
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:58.060]   It's trip light makes great stuff. I should have read it more carefully
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:03.580]   Uh, it says it's a traveler, but it's a traveler only if you don't go outside the us or canada
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:07.180]   It requires 110 volts not doesn't support 220
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:15.020]   I found that out on the last day of the trip after blowing the final fuse. I realized you know that it might be this
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:24.300]   Um, anyway, my pick of the week is this it's an ipad stand just like yours, Andy. I hope you don't mind
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.780]   But I think this is gonna bring you more happiness
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:32.780]   Um, what's your joy here? It is there's if you want joy. This is the this is uh, this ipad stand
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:37.980]   Is suitable for the place where you probably use the ipad more than any other device
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.620]   Uh a special room
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:43.500]   You know one of the things in this
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:48.220]   It said it's that steve jobs wanted a way to use is you wanted that way to surf
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:51.420]   Anyway, it'll hold
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:57.100]   I'm sure if like can I just say that if you if you feel a need for this sort of device and a use for this device
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.260]   You should be going to a better class of restaurant
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:02.620]   See it's well that paper roll you've already fed
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:07.100]   This is uh, who's this who makes this? I don't know anything about it. It just appeared
[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:09.980]   what
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.500]   Bnh photo
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.780]   sells this uh it conveniently has a toilet paper roll and
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:21.900]   An ipad stand on a goose neck. So, you know, you can read read it in any uh orientation does it does it have a
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:24.620]   supplemental stand for for sterile wipes
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:29.740]   There's a there's another more expensive model that hooks into the water and is also of the day
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:33.020]   I think so the treatment how much was this?
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:40.460]   $40 I cannot wait to get this into my new home. You can't put a price on that can't put a price on that
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:42.940]   What says class like an ipad
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:48.940]   Partio bunker we're alive today. Do you leave an ipad in it for your guests when they come over?
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:52.300]   I think that's only fair if you have this in the guest bathroom anyway
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:56.060]   The sadness is that now now we know that steve really is gone
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:59.820]   I would
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:06.620]   With your face by the way the good news is does run ios 7 so you're you're good there the paper is flat
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.780]   It is
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:14.060]   This is papers a little skeuomorphic, but you know, I think it's good in the toilet paper roll you you want a little skeu morphism there
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:18.860]   There it is the cta digital pedestal stand
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:25.660]   With toilet paper part digital part analog nice to cbnh for you know branching out
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:35.100]   musicians probably use this as a mic stand I have to tell you everywhere we went whenever I saw a band even
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:37.900]   Even playing classical music they all had ipads
[01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:46.220]   Everybody used ipads for setlists for lyrics for music it is it's become de rigor on the performing stage
[01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:52.380]   And in the bathroom bathrooms everywhere the acoustics are fantastic
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.580]   different kind of performance stage
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:03.260]   By the way, this is a european roll of european toilet paper made to iso standard
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:05.660]   3,042
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.660]   It feels like sandpaper and it is
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:12.860]   Why do europeans have tougher butts
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:20.300]   Then what is it like in canada? How is your toilet paper up there? We have all the american brands you would okay good. Okay

[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:25.260]   So looking for my squirrel squirrel squirrel squirrel. I know it's here somewhere. It was a trojan squirrel
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:28.700]   This is why I have a whole separate ipad just for the squirrel pictures
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:33.660]   You probably should it's high availability. It's probably a good idea
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:35.900]   Oh, there it is
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:37.740]   But you can't see it. No
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.740]   Dang nabbit
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:45.020]   Is it me? Is it you? Is it life? Well, there we go. Got it. Oh, you got it, but that's not a squirrel now
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:49.900]   Wow, here's the squirrel. Here's the squirrel. This is a trojan squirrel
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:54.060]   This is the money show on the walls of Troy just for you and the anaco
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:57.340]   the trojan squirrel
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.980]   By the way, that's what Troy looks like
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:02.380]   That's it
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:07.420]   There's no no kiddies. No at least they left their rock stacked very neatly
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:13.820]   That's uh cycling that nice. I'm gonna I may be wrong check me if i'm wrong. I think that's layer four
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:18.300]   Layer four had better rocks than layer there you go. There's a squirrel
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:21.660]   Is it layer four chocolate frosting and then they had the job
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:27.020]   I don't think yeah somewhere I have pictures of this was this was an unfortunate
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:31.100]   We thought this was our boat and when we found out it wasn't we were much relieved
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:36.380]   All right. Anyway, I'll show not time to show pictures. We'll do that later

[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:58.380]   YouTube had that solved in three seconds after the launch event
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:04.460]   Does it have worlds is that worlds it's got to have unique worlds
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.220]   Warhol how do you pronounce that word world worlds worlds not world? It's warhols
[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.900]   But it's pronounced world squirrel squirrels
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.780]   Unique squirrel squirrels
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:20.780]   And i'm looking back at my pictures a lot of pictures of rocks for some reason
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:23.900]   This seems like all I did was look at rocks
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:30.460]   Rocks everywhere sideways rots Instagram filter on them. Oh until leo's vacation photos. We sleep by the way

[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:40.220]   It's like an old-fashioned slide show
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:42.940]   Because glios here
