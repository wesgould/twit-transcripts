[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   in which we discuss basically obsessively everything
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   that's going on at a Cupertino.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Joining us right now from the National Association of
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Broadcasters, meaning NAB in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   It's Alex Lindsey in his hotel room.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Hey, Alex.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   How's it going?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Thanks for taking the morning off to be with us.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   It's my pleasure.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I want to get a report, so we'll talk about NAB in just a second.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Also here from back.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   He's back in Boston from Colorado.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Is it the World Affairs Council?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Mr. Andy Inaco.

[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   The week I spent at Altitude was able to link
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   the train for the Boston Marathon coming in three days.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I'm hoping to have my first sub three-hour marathon.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I actually want to mention a marathon a second.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Before we do that, let me introduce our third, my iPad.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   No, no.

[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   All right, third.

[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Mr. Craig Severson.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Hello, Craig.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Thanks.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It's practically iPads are practically a guest on the show.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   It's getting close anyway.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Craig, do you?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I got my iPad.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Of course you picked it up.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's got the first generation.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And really happy.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   That's a beauty.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's the original.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Awesome.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It's also known as a.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I found with the stylus, you can actually use it on the iPad.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   On the new iPad.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You just got to put a little mozzarella on the end of the tip.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Well, cheese works.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's interesting because Apple must have learned that lesson
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   from the Newton that handwriting recognition is a bad deal.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But I have been using the Pogo stylus that's on the iPad.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   That's nice.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   The puffball stylus.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   You like that.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I think we're drawing actually.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's probably a good idea, isn't it?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's, you know, the screen is so much better in terms of the
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   capacitance.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It's so much more reactive than the iPhone.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   So I've been, yeah, I barely.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I got to wonder one of those.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I didn't even think of that.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I got, I've given away two of them so far because I've been just
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   talking to artists for the past three days.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's like, okay, I know that I know that you'll put it to better
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   use than I can.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   But it really does.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   With the auto desk app, I'd be surprised if they don't start
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   doing some sort of a package thing where either you either you
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   get a bulk pack of Pogo sticks or even if they'll just develop a
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Bluetooth pressure sensitive stylus that only works with auto
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   desk apps because that's what people are really, really looking
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   for.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Pogo stick.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   We should, we should just mention who makes a Pogo stick?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Pogo people.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   The Pogo people.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   They make software too for iPhone.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Oh, what is it?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   They actually make, they make a really cool signature app that
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   will insert, you can have people sign stuff.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Heaven design.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   There it is.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   T-N-O.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Ten-one design.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Ten-one design.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   They make a really neat application.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   The reason I know this is because somebody called, a contractor
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   called a radio show and said, I'd like to have my estimates on
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   my notebook and then have them be able to sign it on an iPhone
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   or something.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I said, yeah, this is it.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Ten-one design.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   You have the application running on your iPhone.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You have one little Pogo sticks.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   They sign.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It goes, "Shh!"
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Out of the iPhone into your Mac or Windows and then you place it
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   in the document.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It's a very clever idea.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I got to find somewhere to buy these Pogo sticks.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It doesn't look like you can buy them.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I think that I keep on going to stores that are supposed to have
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   them.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Because I tried to order from Amazon and then they said there was a
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   supply thing.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Like it was there.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I ordered it and then it didn't come.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And so then I figured, well, I'll just go to the Apple store and
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   they said, "Oh, we're sold out."
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And then I went to the next Apple store.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I sold out.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I had them say probably.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And it sounded like they didn't get it.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I was really anxious to try it.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It's really good.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I almost bought one at Macworld at their booth and I'm still
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   kicking myself for not getting it.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   It is definitely something worth having.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I mean, I even thought about it.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Buy two.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It works.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Doesn't it work on the touchpad as well, on the Mac?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Hey, it does.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   The last touchpad.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It does.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Right.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So you can sign your Mac.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   You also have a little bit of sketch.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You can do little sketches on your touchpads.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I got a lack of tablet for that, but that's kind of cool.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   But this is great for the full fingerprint thing when I'm doing demos and such.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Because I'm planning to do some trainings on the iPad and I'm concerned about over time
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   because it's going to be a live camera.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   How much I'm going to smudge it up.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Right.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So with the pen, it actually helps out a lot.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It keeps the screen clean.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Very clever.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I know.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I didn't get to say who Craig is, but you probably remember him from many Mac
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   weeks past.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   He's also a brilliant designer.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.880]   Did some training used to do.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.040]   Do you still do the training videos?
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   I know you have a.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.520]   I did for for Linda dot com.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520]   Yep.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   For keynote.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   linda dot com.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.640]   No tech.tv is his place.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.040]   But he was the pod grunt and the video grunt.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.120]   And that's is that is that gone?
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120]   Pretty much.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   Yeah, I got, you know, I got to work.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   Great job.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.120]   I got a job.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.120]   Grunt media and all that.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.120]   It was great.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.120]   It was like the best video podcast ever.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.120]   So now you're working where Yahoo.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.120]   Yahoo.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.040]   Doing user experience design for the way we're integrating social media.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.200]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   It's moving fast.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   It's really interesting.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   That's very cool.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.160]   We're bringing in Twitter and Facebook and matching it all up.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.640]   So I think it's going to be cool.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.000]   Ex, X, X, X.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.360]   Well, welcome, Craig.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.360]   It's good to have you.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.360]   People asking about Merlin.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.080]   Merlin's been on hiatus because he's working on something, you know, Merlin gets.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.120]   He's very protective of his time and now he's busy again.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.120]   But he'll be back.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.320]   He'll be back and we're glad we can use this opportunity actually to get a number of other
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   people on the show as well.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.800]   So boy, there's a lot to talk about.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.480]   I do want to talk about the iWork Suite on the iPad.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.720]   That's one of the reasons we brought you, Craig.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.200]   But before we do that, how's NEB going?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.640]   Tell me what's the big, now Alex, you're going to be doing a sole bunch of pastel videos
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   from NEB.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   So we're going to do probably, I mean, it's probably going to be, I think it's going to
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.080]   be split up among Mac break video as well as Gear Media Tech and a bunch of other podcasts.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.400]   We're not going to do them all in one long feed and there's going to be segments and
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   episodes.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.480]   It'll be about eight or ten episodes that are made up of, you know, probably shoot a
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.120]   total of 60 segments on Thursday.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.200]   And so I'm doing all the research for it right now.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.160]   Of course, some of the big stuff that's going on, everyone's 3D.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.440]   I mean, we saw 3D at CES.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.880]   What we saw at CES was the consumer end of it.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.920]   And of course, it has ripple effects, you know, way down the line.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.960]   You don't think about things, but like the mixers have to be 3D.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.280]   So when you have a video mixer, it has to be able to manage to, you know, be switching
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.680]   two streams at a time, you know, to keep track of all that stuff, the graphics.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.920]   So they were showing, you can see, you know, motion graphics like this lower third that
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.960]   you're seeing here.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.840]   But it's in 3D, you know, and so the graphics, I'll have to be able to be rendered out that
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   way.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.040]   So the glasses laying everywhere, Panasonic has released a camera or announced a camera
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.800]   that is actually, it's got, you know, it's a 3D video camera.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.640]   It's $20,000 and it's got two chips in it.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.840]   So 3D is a big thing.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.960]   And the other thing you've seen a lot of is these DSLR solutions that people are getting
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.760]   really excited about.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.720]   In addition to that, miniaturization and stuff for the web, of course, a lot of what
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.240]   you see, what I went through for the first tour was what the big companies are doing,
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.320]   these huge compressors and big, you know, to do the streams.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.520]   But as you start moving towards the central and south hall, you're seeing just tons of
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.800]   how do you empower people to be, you know, broadcasting from anywhere.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   I love that.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.680]   And that's, and that's the kind of stuff we're doing.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   And we're wandering around.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.000]   We're kind of, we had a little bit of a fall start yesterday, but we're wandering around
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.080]   with the live U-Box.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.080]   So we'll be doing some live.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   Oh, you got one.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.080]   Oh, that's great.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.520]   So we got one, we, we were a little trouble with the battery and you streamed us yesterday.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.400]   But we'll have the, we'll be shooting about six o'clock, we'll be at a soft homage event
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.200]   and then we're going to go to the final cut user group tonight with it.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.480]   And so we'll be walking around getting people's reactions to CS5 and talking about, you know,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.240]   what they're seeing, what, what they love.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.080]   So where will people see these feeds, the live feeds?
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.520]   These will, people can go to Picsupport.com and at Picsupport.com you'll see an NAB.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.320]   There'll be an, there's an NAB button at the top so you can just click on it.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.840]   And when it's running live, you'll see us there and we should be there.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.160]   Between six to six thirty, we'll start broadcasting tonight from one event and we'll be going
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.880]   on and off all evening, both tonight and tomorrow.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.320]   So it should be, it should be a lot of fun.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.920]   We're pretty excited about it.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.320]   And Picsupport.com and then go to NAB.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.520]   Right in the menu bar and that's where the live stream from.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.520]   That's where the live stream will be.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.520]   Okay.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.960]   And you, they can also go, of course, to, you know, if they go to the channels within
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.480]   Ustream, it's just PXC, NAB to 2010.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.240]   So they can, they can look at, look at it there too.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.640]   And it's kind of fun.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   The box is a lot of fun.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.040]   It gets a lot of, I'm sure you got a lot of attention.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.880]   It's out by Southwest, but let me tell you, you get a lot of attention on the boxes,
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.480]   you know, NAB, because everyone's like, what is that?
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   How are you doing?
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480]   What are you doing?
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.520]   And so, and then there's other people coming out with boxes like that.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.120]   I, you know, there's a lot of miniaturized switchers.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.160]   So the inter graphics switcher, you know, like there's, I saw one that we're going to,
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.000]   we're going to cover, which is eight, eight SDI channels in HD or SD.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.760]   It has all the graphics all built in.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.960]   It's a, it's a, it's a portable box.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.440]   You can just close it up.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   How portable.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.240]   It's like the size, I think it's close to carry on.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.680]   I'm not sure if it's exactly carry on size, but it's literally you open it up, plug everything
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.560]   in the back and hit go.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   How much?
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.120]   20, well, this SD version is 21,000 and the HD version is 27,000.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.920]   Um, anyway, this, we don't want to get too much into the broadcast stuff because I know
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.840]   that most of our audience is not into that.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.400]   But there will be lots to talk about tonight at pixel core.com Tuesday night.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   I'm going to suck.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.400]   By the way, a lot of coverage.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.880]   Of course, CS five, which covered releases.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.920]   Yeah, we're going to get to that too.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.840]   Cause we, that we will cover and the new Mac books are out finally, uh, and we've got
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.360]   to talk about iPhone 4.0.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.400]   We talked a little bit about the launch on Twitch, but we haven't had a chance to talk
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   about it on Mac break weekly.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.760]   And I'm going to say right now, maya kalpa, I was wrong.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.760]   I said there will never be multitasking.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.600]   Yeah, it's, it's, it's multi functions.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   Maybe I was right.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   We'll find out.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   Just a little bit.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   Let me take a break.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   We're going to come back.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   I do want to talk about those new Mac books.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   No, I did not buy a Mac book.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   It just happened.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   I was wondering about that.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.960]   Without many, my, any cooperation on my part, I'm thrilled.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.200]   I knew it was like the sub show.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.040]   You buy 10 before the announcement.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.600]   You get the first one after the announcement.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   Yachts.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   That's two.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.760]   Um, but I do want to mention our friends at Citrix, the folks who do the great go to
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.840]   my PC, great remote access product that works on the Mac as well as on the PC.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.960]   In fact, you can even visit Macs from a PC or PCs from a Mac completely flexible.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.480]   And you can try it free right now by going to go to my PC.com/Mac break.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.360]   Here's how it works.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.120]   You go to the PC or Mac you want to make the remote host.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.520]   Most people do it with their office computer, but maybe it's your home computer.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.360]   You open up your web browser and you just go to go to my PC.com/Mac break.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   That's it.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.040]   I mean, it really is simple.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.160]   It takes about a minute to install.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.600]   I don't know exactly what they're doing.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:35.840]   I think it's a Java, a little Java stub because it downloads like instantly.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.600]   I mean, it couldn't be faster.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.160]   And now you're done.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:46.920]   There's no router configuration DMZing firewall port forwarding, nothing like that.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.880]   It uses a natural, versatile and very sophisticated technologies to make it happen automatically.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.240]   128-bit SSL encryption as well.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.440]   And now you got it free for 30 days.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.720]   So when you want to access this computer, you go to any other computer PC or Mac.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   You open up the web browser on that computer and you go to go to my PC.com and you'll see
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.760]   there's a link right there.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.520]   Join or not join a visit another computer or something like that.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.400]   Now you log on to your account when I say it.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.840]   I only do this every day.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.680]   You log on to your account with your email and your secure password.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.120]   You click the connect button and boom, you're in.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.200]   You are now on your computer, Mac or PC seeing the other remote computer.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.800]   And I'm not just seeing it.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   You're working with it.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.800]   You can run programs.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.120]   You can access emails and receive.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.400]   You can access any network resource.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.440]   You can even drag and drop files from one computer to the other.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.600]   Simply, easily and most importantly, securely.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.240]   That is something that is difficult for road access products to save it and not forget
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.240]   my PC.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.160]   I always been 100% secure using state of the art SSL.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.800]   Go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.000]   Try it free today.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.080]   It is more than fun, more than a convenience.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.440]   It is a must have utility.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.000]   Go to my PC.com/Macbreak.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   So they did it.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.880]   They did it this morning, early in the morning.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.920]   The Apple store went down.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.880]   This is exactly what the rumor mongers were saying in fact that it would happen today.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:23.800]   And prices were exactly what Mac rumors had.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:30.040]   There was a leaked price list from one of the Mac resellers.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.240]   So here we have them, the new laptops.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.120]   Now, a surprise.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   No update for the $1,000 MacBook.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.240]   That's the same.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.840]   No update, really a surprise for the MacBook Air, which is really long in the tooth.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.480]   And I don't think after this anybody is going to buy it ever again.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.640]   But the MacBook Pros are looking sweet, except another surprise, the i5 and the i7 are only
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.160]   in the 15 and 17 inches.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.240]   The 13 inch gets the core 2 still.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   Still stuck with it.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:07.120]   It's a faster core 2 and a faster bus, I believe, 1,066 megahertz bus, the gigahertz bus.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:13.320]   But better video, much better video, the 320M G-force graphics.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:19.040]   But here's the thing that makes me want the 13, even though it's still a core 2, 10 hour
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.280]   battery life, they claim.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.320]   Aren't they claiming that for most of them there?
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320]   I mean, it's pretty.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.200]   No, eight hours for the 8 to 9 for the 15 inch and the 17 inch.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.040]   The 17, by the way, is not an i7.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.800]   It's an i5.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.520]   So the 17 isn't really the workhorse.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.840]   If you want the fastest laptop Apple makes, you're going to get a 15 inch, believe it or
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.840]   not.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   That makes sense to me.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.560]   It's a 17 inch, I think you can do a $200 upgrade to the 17 inch to move it to ISO.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.080]   Oh, yeah, there's, I should say there's BTO options, of course.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080]   What am I thinking?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   Yeah, there's an i7 BTO.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   That's not bad.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.080]   200 bucks.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.080]   That's not bad.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.520]   8 gigs of RAM for 400 bucks.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.520]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:01.320]   Now, for the most affordable, they are putting solid state drives in at a fairly normal premium,
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.160]   128 gigs for 200 bucks, 256 for 650.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.960]   And if you want a 512 gigabyte solid state drive, it's a mere $1,300.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.320]   I've definitely decided that my next install, I'm just been putting off trying to rebuild
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.120]   my computer from scratch.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.480]   My next install is definitely going to be with an SSID.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.080]   Oh, no, there's no reason at this point.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:30.000]   I have an SSD that I put in after the fact of my 15, my old unibody 15, and I couldn't
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.760]   go back to a solid state and non solid state drive.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.760]   I just couldn't.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.080]   So you have any durability issues?
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.720]   Not that I can tell, and I've been talking to, we have a PC hardware show this week in
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.880]   computer hardware, and there's a hardware expert from PC perspective, Alan Malvin-Tano
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.920]   is great, and the king of SSDs.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.280]   And he says, as far as we can tell, he's been testing them for a long time.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.880]   There's not any, the life expectancy is the same or better.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.400]   Now, I don't know what drives, I would hope that Apple for the price they're charging
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.680]   is using the premium Intel drives X25M, I bet it's not.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.200]   Oh, no.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.960]   But we present a high-high-high resolution screen, too.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.600]   Yeah, I like that VTO off option.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   That's new.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   Yeah, then that's in the 15 only.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   15, yeah.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.200]   Or this, maybe the 17, too.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   I didn't see it.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   Let me see.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.200]   Yeah, 15, 40 by 900.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   Yeah, isn't that awesome?
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   What would you get that for?
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.880]   It's not, it's not, no, no, it's by 10, 50.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.880]   It's, isn't it?
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   Oh, let me see.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.800]   Oh, 15-inch, the highest-high-high resolution is 1440 and 900.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   900.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:46.760]   Oh, and then on the 17, you can go 19, 20 by 1200, or, uh, no, I guess that's it.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.760]   That's your choice.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.360]   No, on the 15, you can get a 1680 by 1050.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.360]   That's what I thought.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.800]   Yeah, it's in there.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   Okay.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.600]   I'm in the store now looking at it.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.800]   So if you go to high-end 15, you can buy--
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.360]   That's a lot of pixel density.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.600]   It's not, you know what's sad?
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.600]   It's not quite 1080p.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.000]   It's like, so 30 pixels short.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.680]   I think that I would argue that, uh, at the size of the screen, a 15-inch screen, uh,
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.680]   you're not going to, you wouldn't really--
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   You don't want to--
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.520]   You're able to tell the difference between 1080p and 720p.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.320]   It just doesn't resolve really that well.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.400]   I mean, they probably look very simple.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.920]   You just need, you need a lot more screen than one thing to really--
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.680]   It's only a hundred bucks more to get 1680 by 1050.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.680]   So graphics guys, why would I get the lower-res screen?
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.680]   It wouldn't.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.680]   You wouldn't.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   That wouldn't.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.960]   But the thing is, all of this stuff stacks up as costs for Apple.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.200]   So what they're doing is they keep the cost down so people don't complain about getting,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.880]   you know, that Apple is so expensive, is what they do is they give you these low prices
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.280]   and then they let you build the order.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.000]   By the time you build what you really want it, you end up spending another thousand--
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   $3,000?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   So, um--
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   But then-- but they don't want--
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.400]   That's the base price because that's the-- but you definitely want to go in and configure
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.120]   these because they are really kind of minimized.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.240]   They did keep the base prices close to the previous price.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.280]   I think it's up a hundred on the low end and down a hundred on the high end.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.920]   So they're really right in the same-- as usual with Apple, they try not-- they try to give
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.440]   you more for the same amount of money, not more for less, not less for more, more for
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.160]   the same.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.720]   So memory, do we go to-- do we go to eight gigs children?
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.240]   I always put as much rent-- one of the fastest ways to accelerate the speed of your computer
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.240]   is RAM, you know, and so--
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   All right.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.240]   So I'm going to put eight gigs in here.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.560]   256 gig solid-state drive, right?
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.600]   I can't-- I'm not going to spend that.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.960]   I mean, I almost tempted just to go with 128.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.960]   Just go with 128.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   [LAUGHS]
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   Got to get the 15-- 1680 by 1050, glossy, though.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   Glossy or any glare?
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.960]   Any glare?
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.960]   Any glare?
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   And a glossy?
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   I like glossy.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.960]   So it's two to two on that.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:51.760]   But really, are you spending that much money on this huge, powerful computer with this huge
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.760]   display?
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.240]   And I'm going to have 128 gigabytes of storage.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.240]   So I can have one Photoshop app and almost four movies.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.240]   [LAUGHS]
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.240]   I got an iPad for the movies.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   All right.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   I'm not buying this anyway.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.240]   OK, so--
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   Ah!
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.240]   So I'm just playing.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.640]   So you're saying-- you're saying what?
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.040]   Get the spinning drive?
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.960]   I'm saying unless you can afford the big-ass SSD, get yourself a half-terabyte mechanical
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.680]   drive and just back the damn thing up.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.240]   You can, for 50 bucks more, get 7,200 RPMs.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.240]   There you go.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.040]   And just back it up.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   Just back it up.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   Just back it up.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.440]   I'm not as big of a fan of SSDs on laptops as some other people are.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.440]   Oh, I am.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.240]   Because the money is just not there.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.840]   I would much rather have a mechanical hard drive and four days in Maui than have the
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   SSD.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   It's just a hell lot more.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   All right.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.840]   So here it is.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.840]   I've configured it for eight gigs.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:49.440]   I listened to Andy and only bumped it to the 7,200 RPM spinning drive.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.920]   I have put in the high res anti-glare widescreen 1080 by 1080 by 1050 display.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   That's it.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   Just a little-- a few upgrades.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.920]   And what have I got it to?
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.920]   $27.99.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.920]   And the only three of them.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   Anybody else?
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:09.400]   I was talking to somebody who was showing me his just super duper gaming PC that could
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.400]   probably be close to those specifications and he paid like $1,200 for it.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.160]   But it's running Windows 7.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.240]   It's running Windows 7, but it's running at hell a fast.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.640]   He can also run the probably the CS5 apps just as fast on it.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.600]   Andy, would you like to be on Windows Weekly?
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.000]   It can be arranged.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Oh.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.720]   I'm on-- I was about to say something really rude.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.720]   OK, good.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.720]   I'm glad you didn't--
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   Well, let's see.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   Well, let's see.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   The Windows Weekly probably has a much, much wider audience being 80% of the market share.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   Well, I get paid more for it maybe.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   I don't know.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.720]   You might.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.720]   You might.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   You might.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.360]   Are you just a money grubber, Andy?
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.520]   Is that all you care about?
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.920]   Have you know soul, my friend?
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.800]   I'm a freelance journalist and a rapidly collapsing print market.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.720]   If there were money out there to grub, I would be grubbing it, grubbing it, grubbing it.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.080]   No, no, it's something.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.120]   There's an economy that does well below $1,000.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.440]   Who bought my aunt a Mac book, her first Mac, just a few weeks ago.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.240]   And for $1,000, you're definitely in there.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.240]   They're paying a couple hundred dollar premium.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.280]   And as I explained to my aunt, this is the cheapest Mac that Apple makes, but it's still
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.200]   the equivalent of a premium Windows notebook.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.720]   And you can sort of sell that idea.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.640]   That's only a couple hundred bucks more than what you'd be spending on the Windows side.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.480]   But when you're starting to say, yes, you're going to be spending an extra $800 to $900
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.640]   for that added level of performance over what you would get on a Windows 7 notebook.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:43.440]   And now, Windows 7, the fair, be honest, is not the equal of Mac OS.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.680]   It's definitely a very, very competitive, very, very easy to use and very reliable operating
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.680]   system.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.000]   So it just worries me that when Apple does the speed bump to these things, it's always
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.680]   well-weight for all.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.680]   You can almost build the order one for a little less than $1,800 if you just make sure that
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   you just don't do anything.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.000]   So they'll have you hold out your hands and they'll just pour silica into your hands and
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.600]   you have to sort of mash the app together.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   Make it yourself.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   Build your own.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   Not build the order.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   Build your own.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.520]   And notice that the star of the show is still the star of the show.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.940]   If you go to apple.com, the front page thing is still the iPad, you have to click into a
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.200]   second page and then look carefully in the middle of that page to notice that, oh, wait,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.000]   is that the word new next to Mac books?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Oh, there it is.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Oh, this little thing here.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.440]   I think it's representative of the revenue being generated by those apps.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.080]   I feel relieved though, because I was a little concerned, remember we've talked a little
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.600]   bit about maybe Apple's going to turn its back on the desktops and OS 10.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.240]   I realized there's only one way you can develop for the iPhone now.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   Right.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   With a Mac desktop.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.560]   So at least I think they'll keep those going just for the developers.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:57.120]   So they're continuing the fine tradition of having the Mac be like the Lisa was with
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   a Macintosh.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   Right.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.800]   We're about two years away from putting this thing in a landfill in a warm Utah.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   What about the now?
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.120]   See, I got to say, what about going with the 13?
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.440]   Because of that improved battery left 10 hours.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.360]   Do you think now in the past, Apple has always, this is a really interesting thing.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.040]   The iPad has completely changed the past.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.120]   Apple's always like every other company highly inflated the battery life.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.960]   The iPad everybody's shocked actually gets some sometimes better battery life than they
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.960]   said.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.560]   Do you think they've said a new standard and now we can actually expect 10 hours from
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.080]   the 13 inch?
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.640]   I think so.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   My fat's from experience with with my own to new Mac book and I'm amazed that it's one
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.440]   of those things that the sales person added to the Apple store had to correct me on because
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   I was saying, oh, five or six hours and they're saying, oh, this one, the new ones, you'll
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.600]   definitely get nine or 10.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.560]   I think that that definitely ups the ante.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.040]   But another thing where at least in the marketing materials for most Windows notebooks, things
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.600]   like netbooks and things like the less expensive models are being marketed towards students
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.000]   are also advertising six, seven, eight, nine, and even 10 hours of battery life.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:11.240]   One of our chat room folks put together a buy list for the PC said, you know, I think
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.040]   they're all saying, well, you could just hackintosh a lesser laptop and get the same
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.120]   specs for, you know, a lot less.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:28.120]   Although he put together a duplicate of a Mac Pro with a Xeon E5520, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   I mean, Windows seven and it's about half as much, $1771 compared to 3542.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.040]   I know, right?
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:50.120]   Greg, I start to sort of lose my confidence the more you spend on a hackintosh, a $350
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.320]   Dell mini 10 V converter to a Macintosh is a great, still a great buy, still a great deal
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.920]   if you need like a real notebook with a keyboard and stuff.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.160]   I don't know if I'd spend a thousand bucks, $1,100, $1,200 on something that could just
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160]   go poo down.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.240]   And on the battery life question on the 13 inch, I, I'd kind of be surprised there.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   I am again, the iPad.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   I was kind of.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.040]   I was obviously a focus.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.640]   I remember my farm is go, it needs help.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   It's a.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.640]   Oh, you need help.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.720]   I want to play fair with fire.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.520]   I'm putting MLB dot MLB 10 on this one.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.280]   I got to watch the damn Red Sox.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   Isn't it?
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.160]   I got to say, but then we'll let you talk, Craig.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:35.360]   MLB, MLB, I bought it for the Android and I did not want to buy it for the iPad, but
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   you know what?
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.360]   It's so freaking awesome.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   Yes.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.360]   Yes.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.160]   That I just had to most ready to buy the TV option just to make it that much awesome
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.320]   or you could put TV on this to video on it.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   You get live video.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   That's an additional subscription, but you can basically turn this into your mobile,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.440]   just mobile baseball, just battle station.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.120]   I think I'm going to watch the Yankees game right now.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.040]   I mean, it's practically video because you get the play by play and all of that stuff.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   Go for a touchdown, Leo.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.920]   Yeah, it's like watching like EA baseball, only being played by professional baseball
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   players.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.760]   You know, I want to take this to the game and watch the pitches go across the plate
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.760]   and everything.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.880]   I mean, because baseball geeks really love all this extra stats and information and
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.960]   it's all here, you know, you can see everything that's going on right here.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   Anyway, I'm sorry, Craig, you were going to talk about something of actual interest.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   Go ahead.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.320]   Well, I was thinking of the battery life claims on the 13th.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   Did you say batter batter?
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   Hey, batter batter.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   Hey, batter batter.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   Hey, batter batter.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:38.440]   I think on a laptop, it's, you know, really does go into the, it depends question.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:44.000]   I think the interesting thing about the iPad is there's not great differences in the processing
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.880]   power given the limitations of the platform.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.000]   So, you know, you can sort of predict this long battery and the fact that the thing is
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.320]   practically one big battery with a little electronics as opposed to the laptop where,
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.960]   you know, if someone's what you do really does affect the battery in a much different
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.960]   way.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   You can do so much more on the laptop than you can on the iPad.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.720]   Well, and I, you know, I have to admit my expectation of my internal battery is about
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.320]   two hours, you know, two, two and a half hours.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.360]   So even five would be good, but.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.400]   Well, if it did five, I have met minds turned up to high performance, use the big graphics
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.080]   chip and then I'm using it for graphics and putting it.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.080]   So I'm going to wait.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   I think I'm going to wait.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.840]   I'm going to wait and see what the real battery life is.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:27.080]   But if it really worked 10 hours with reasonable usage and I have to say that my reaction to
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.480]   it is that I have this hyper Mac, you know, my hyper Mac battery, which is, you know,
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:36.200]   I got the kind of the second from the biggest one that'll do add 17 hours to it.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.440]   And it just sits in the bottom of my bag and it's got a little thing that plugs into my,
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.000]   my power and I.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.440]   And so when I'm traveling, I don't really feel it, I don't really think about it.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.560]   I don't use it that often.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.240]   I find plugs whenever I can find them.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:54.160]   But if I need to, I'm portable for at least a day, you know, without, without having my
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.640]   battery have to last that long.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.920]   So I've become kind of insensitive to the, I mean, it has to have a reasonable amount
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.200]   of battery power, but it doesn't have to be any longer.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.280]   I mean, for me, if it was three hours or three and a half hours, fine, but it doesn't need
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.080]   to be any more than that because I have others.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.320]   I'm starting to feel a little bifurcation too, by the way.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.880]   I don't feel the pressure to buy a notebook.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   I've got an iPad and I think I'm wondering if the iPad may cut into a little bit into
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.120]   the sales of the new notebooks.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.800]   I think it's going to, I think it's sliding the category down a little bit.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:28.600]   Like I have a 13 inch, I have a fix those buttons.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:33.280]   I've got a 13 inch MacBook Pro now and I really liked the portability of it as opposed to
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.040]   15, which I've always had, but I'm paying the price with the, with the slower graphics
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.680]   card and not quite the performance that I would want for doing real video production.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.560]   But now that I've got the iPad, I'm looking at my next one.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.720]   I'm not even, not even get a notebook again.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.400]   I might just get an iMac.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   That's powerful enough.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.080]   Well, and I have to admit, I've been moving towards thinking of getting the 17 inch as
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.600]   a replacement, which I said I would never do, mostly because I need the Express card slot
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.440]   that's in the side of the 17 inch to interface with some of our tools.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.280]   And I feel like if I'm just going to be walking around and I want portability, I'm going to
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   be using my iPad.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.480]   And if I'm going to be doing production on set, then I need something that's a portable
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.360]   workhorse that really does all the things that I need.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.800]   So I'm kind of just, it is kind of just completely splitting those.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.240]   There's not an in between like, I don't, if I'm just going to walk around, I just, I really
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.280]   have been moving to my iPad very quickly and been pretty happy.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.440]   You know, I wish I could do my key, all my keynote presentations on it.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.440]   I tried.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440]   I did.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.440]   And because there was only one that I had out of the four that didn't have any video
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   in it.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.440]   Oh, it won't do video.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.440]   It will.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.440]   It will.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.440]   Will it?
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.440]   Do you have to build it on?
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.840]   I couldn't, can you import the video?
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.200]   You have to, I couldn't figure out a way to get it into keynote.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.600]   That part I haven't looked at yet.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   Still looking into all the parts.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   All right.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   Save this.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.000]   This is a good conversation because Craig is the I work king and the key and even more
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   so a keynote king.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   So good.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   This is good.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   I want to, I want to have this conversation.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.960]   We're going to get to that in just a little bit.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:06.360]   There is a lot to talk about including a lot of upset over Apple's new restrictions in
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.600]   iPhone 4.0.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.160]   My question, somebody was asking this, I think, at Hacker News.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.240]   How many of the people who are upset are actually iPhone developers and how many of
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.800]   them are not?
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.680]   Do the iPhone, are the iPhone developers upset about this?
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.560]   The people who are actually going to be affected by these rules or is it an abstract political
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   debate?
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.560]   I don't know.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.560]   We'll find out.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.400]   But I also need to take a little time out here.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.320]   So you may smoke them if you've got them, gentlemen.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.480]   If you'd like to spill wine in my carpet, go right ahead.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.200]   There's plenty there already.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.280]   We were talking before the show.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.280]   My daughter had a party.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:47.320]   I'm going to say it was not a good party.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   Squarespace.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.280]   It was like that one in the movies.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.560]   It was like in Superbad.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.720]   That party in Superbad.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.000]   The guy pours out all the time, detergent, and puts beer in there.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   It was like that.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.040]   It was that party.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.280]   The fight breaks out in the backyard.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.840]   That party was at my house last night.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.400]   If you are starting a website, my friends, I got to tell you about Squarespace.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.400]   What a great place.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   Where's the website?
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   I know it's here somewhere.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.560]   Squarespace.com.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.560]   That's right.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:23.920]   So the secret behinds exceptional websites, may I remind you, is squarespace.com.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.560]   If you're happy with your web hosting company, if they're giving you everything you want
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.120]   at a great price and you've got the greatest content management system, you don't need
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.120]   to listen to this commercial.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.320]   On the other hand, if you're looking for great web hosting, that includes software that is
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:44.720]   to die for the best looking stuff out there, including amazing iPhone application.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.120]   I'm sure there'll be an iPad application soon.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:57.760]   Social integration, stats, intuitive editing, form and data collection, photo galleries.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.880]   You got to look at Squarespace.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.840]   Go to the squarespace.com/macbreak and then check out the examples page.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.320]   These are people who have done Squarespace sites.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.320]   I've mentioned this before.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:13.480]   The thing I love about Squarespace is no site looks like a Squarespace site.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.200]   Some of these other CMSs, content management systems, you know, oh, I could tell that's
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.240]   a Drupal site or I could tell that's a --
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.360]   >> Our Pixel core.com.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.280]   The new pixel core.com site is all squarespace.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   >> That's a beautiful site.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.760]   You did a nice job with that.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.760]   >> Thank you.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   >> Easy to do.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.880]   First of all, you start with great templates.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.880]   But then you could customize them to your heart's desire, even use JavaScript and CSS
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.720]   to make it completely unique.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.360]   Look, here's our blog inside that Twit.tv.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.760]   We love this blog.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   >> Right.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.560]   >> You want to make changes when you want to add pages.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.960]   >> You want to do all those things.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.760]   >> It's just a piece of cake.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.600]   And you just throw them in there.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.840]   >> Squarespace, it's a piece of cake.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.240]   You heard it here first.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.320]   Now I got a way you can get 10% off for the life of your site.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.280]   Now that's a good deal.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.680]   When you try it free, no credit card needed when you go to squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.680]   So that's kind of nice.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.200]   That makes it very simple.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.360]   And then if you decide to sign up after your two-week credit card free trial and you decide
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:17.560]   to give them a credit card number and build that site, use the coupon code MACBRAKE.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:23.320]   You get 10% off not just for the first year or the first five years, but the first forever.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.720]   The second forever is up to you.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.880]   10% off.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.000]   That could add up to hundreds of dollars, thousands even.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.720]   Use the promo code MACBRAKE.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.720]   It's a great way.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   Just try it.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   You don't have to take our work for it.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.720]   Just try it.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.080]   A great way to make a great site.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.160]   And so say all of us.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.880]   We have so many stories.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:52.240]   Let's talk about the iPhone 4 because I think that's really funny that somebody wrote to
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   Steve Jobs.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.400]   Steve Jobs is very forthcoming these days in his email.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.480]   Wrote to Steve Jobs and said, "Hey, I hate this.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.040]   And Jobs wrote back and said, 'We think Gruber got it right.'"
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   That was cool.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   Now I don't know.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.640]   The other thing, how do you think we should get Gruber's on last week?
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.840]   We should get him on again because I wonder how he feels.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.440]   Is that good or bad if you're a blogger?
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.560]   And the mothership says, "Oh, yeah, Gruber's the guy."
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.960]   I mean, it's good.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   It's good.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.800]   It's good because his point of view was good.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   Okay.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   Let's talk about it.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   So first of all, let's say what happened.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.160]   iPhone 4.0, 7.10th polls, blah, blah, blah, multi-- we'll talk about, I guess, some of
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   those multitasking, better business support.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.160]   I adds.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.360]   Not so crazy about the new gaming platform.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.800]   It's kind of driving some of these other guys crazy.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.400]   But there was no announcement of what many think was the most important part of iPhone
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   4.0.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   Steve didn't say anything about it.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.560]   Somebody had to dig through the developer's agreement.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.240]   The agreement says, "You may not use non-Apple tools to develop for the iPhone."
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   Period.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.640]   Now, everybody knows that Dobi was developing a cross-platform tool based on Flash so that
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:04.440]   you could write once and run on all the platforms.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.440]   And it's now-- it's dead.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.520]   In fact, it's NCS5.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.680]   It's dead.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:16.320]   So now, Gruber wrote two blog posts.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:22.440]   And I think it was the second post that Steve was referring to when he says, "John speaks
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   for us."
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.440]   Jeez.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:31.640]   And let me see if I can read the salient.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:37.000]   So what Apple does not want is for some other company to establish a de facto software platform
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.560]   on top of Coco Touch for several reasons.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.160]   I mean, there's a pure business reason.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:53.200]   If there's a cross-platform app market, there's no differentiation for the iPhone.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.560]   All the phones can do the same thing.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.200]   But it makes a second point, which I think is very good, which is that and a meta platform
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.000]   like that would be out of Apple's control.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.360]   Consider a world where some other company's cross-platform toolkit proved wildly popular
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.880]   than Apple releases a major new feature to the iPhone and the other toolkit doesn't adopt
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   it.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.000]   At that point, it's the other company that controls what third-party developers can do.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.320]   And Apple's, of course, that's an ethnom-- an ethnomata Steve Jobs.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.800]   So you agree with that, Craig?
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   I do.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   I do.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.280]   I mean, also, when you have these cross-platform tools and you start porting them over, I
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.040]   mean, you can't get some weird libraries that are laying around in the code.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.720]   It can just affect the performance somewhat.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.320]   It's much better if you kind of use the tools that Apple's providing.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.480]   And they're not that they're crummy tools.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   They're actually really good tools.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.920]   No, they're great tools.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.920]   That's not the point.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:50.280]   What if Microsoft had said you can only develop with Microsoft tools for Windows?
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.280]   And Windows--
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.280]   They'd said that early on.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.280]   That's what it would have done.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.280]   That's what it would have done.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   That's what it would have done.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.240]   Well, that's that train runs on-- trains run on time, are you?
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.240]   I mean, a dictatorship does produce--
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.920]   But I think one of the issues is that as a Mac user, a long time Mac user, I've watched
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.360]   some of my favorite apps get ported to the PC.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.560]   And none of them run better after they were ported to the PC on the Mac.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.800]   It never turns out well for a Mac user.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.040]   It always is.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.520]   Because it's the lowest common denominator.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.280]   What a PC can't do that or we start conforming to the Windows.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.760]   I don't know if you remember what Photoshop was like before.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.760]   That was just going to say.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.760]   I think of Adobe.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.480]   And so the thing-- I mean, we're going right back to the company that's complaining about
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   it.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.000]   It is that those-- the Adobe apps are great.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.760]   I use them every day.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.600]   And they feel like a PC app being put into a Mac.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.160]   They don't feel like a true Mac all the way app.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.080]   They're not taking full advantage of all the things that they could do.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.600]   They would be a better--
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   Really?
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.400]   Photoshop would be better if it was only written for the Mac.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.600]   If it wasn't a cross-platform, we weren't trying to deal with the PC.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.000]   We weren't lowest common denominator in between the two.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.640]   It would be a better app for a Mac.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.120]   I thought my favorite part of that blog post was it just cut right to the point.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   He used the example of the Kindle app, which is available-- Amazon did a Kindle app for
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   the iPhone.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.000]   They did a Kindle app for the Mac.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.720]   For the iPhone, they had to use Apple's tools and all of Apple's APIs and build an iPhone
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   app.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.720]   And it looks great.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.520]   For the Mac version, they just simply ported code using whatever framework would get it
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.520]   done quickly.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.520]   You tease with these.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.800]   It's a window that has text in it.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.520]   It is technically a book reader.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.840]   But it's just a stuff that is not good at all.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.320]   I had a long argument last week.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.160]   Actually, I'm sorry, I was mostly one-way argument because I was trying to understand
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:42.080]   this analyst's point of view about why no journalist would ever want to have their content
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.640]   published through Apple Store, whether it was Time magazine, whether it was a book publisher,
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.640]   whether it was someone like me.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.400]   And I'm trying to get to where the core of his argument was.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:58.200]   And it seemed to be that Apple was behaving like Stalin, like a tyrannical dictator.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.880]   And I just don't get that.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.160]   I don't get where people think that this is a huge deal.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.720]   I think that the correct way to look at this is that this is a decision that Apple made.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.440]   They're not trying to control the world and not trying to control the users.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.400]   They're just kind of trying to control their own platform.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.640]   And if this is the bad choice, then the one group that's going to really pay for it is
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.640]   going to be Apple.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.000]   So that's a risk that they have the ability to take.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.320]   No one's being sent to a Gulag anywhere.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.200]   This is just deciding how applications get built on the iPhone and the iPad period.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.720]   No one's forcing them to do that.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.360]   I guess the question is, is this, yeah, of course, Apple can do it and you don't have
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.440]   to buy an iPhone.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.960]   But I guess the question is, is this the right thing to do for the iPhone users?
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   Is this good for iPhone users is the question?
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.600]   It will result in better software.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.840]   So yes, it will.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.840]   I think it's better for the iPhone user because I think that the issue is, the question
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:55.480]   is, there was here at N&B, there was a big hubbub about a lot of producers who are making
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:59.680]   3D films are really upset about Clash of the Titans because Clash of, I mean, they were
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.320]   a little upset about Alice in Wonderland.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.120]   They're really upset with Clash of the Titans because it's bad 3D.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.000]   It is, you might as well not even bother to see Clash of the Titans in 3D because they
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   just wanted to make some money.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.280]   So they just wanted to port it over to 3D, cut some stuff up, try to give it a little
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.080]   bit of dimension.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.920]   And they said, if people keep on releasing films like this, no one's going to buy any,
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.640]   no one's going to buy 3D.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:28.360]   In the same way, the issue with the iPhone is that we will get lower quality, less stable
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.040]   applications through these kind of ports.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:35.120]   And I won't feel safe of, oh, it's going to be a good application.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   And it could be flooded.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.400]   I mean, it could end up being, a third of the apps are done that way.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:46.000]   And so do we have to, if a user, if we do end up with stuff that is written by third
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.480]   parties, I want badges on and said that's what it is because I can tell you right now
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.040]   that unless it was extremely compelling.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.040]   Aren't there a bunch of crappy products in the 185,000 title app store?
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.040]   Yes.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.840]   I think it would only be native tools.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:41:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.800]   I don't know, but I think it would only, this would only exacerbate that situation.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.840]   Exacerbate and Exacerbate.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:11.000]   Yeah, I think reducing the development platform is going to reduce a lot of these junky apps
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.360]   that are out there.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.360]   And I think that's going to be a big plus for the brand.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.600]   You know, it's interesting, I look back on, or the early days of Mac and all the Windows
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.000]   people are saying, we got all these apps and isn't it great?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.280]   And us Mac people are like, well, no, we've got plenty and the ones we have are really
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.760]   good and a lot better than the thousands you have.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.720]   Now this argument is kind of coming back around to Apple in the other way.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.920]   I actually think that this is probably one way that Steve is actually going to trim down
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.360]   the amount of apps that are out there.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.680]   I'm just going to increase the quality rather than the quantity.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:47.480]   Just by the way, not just Adobe products, there's a good post on 37signals.com.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.880]   Five rational arguments against Apple's policy.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:55.520]   And they, in that post say there's also titanium gambit scheme, mono touch and Unity 3D.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.400]   A bunch of game mentions.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   It's not merely that you can't use non-Apple tools.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.560]   You have to use Objective-C.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.440]   And their developers don't want to use Objective-C.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.440]   And it doesn't...
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.520]   I think I want to argue that one of the ones that the map was built.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.840]   What I really want to know from Apple is, is this limitation a outright restriction
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.760]   and ban saying that if you're using any external code libraries, if your software is not written
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.760]   to...
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.040]   With our tools with Objective-C, we will ban the...
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.920]   We will not approve those apps.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.360]   Or is that just the potential poison pill saying that we reserve the right to ban your
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.720]   app if it does not use our tools.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.320]   We also reserve the right to make your app completely incompatible and not care with future OS
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.320]   releases.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.000]   Those are two slightly different positions.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.160]   One is simply saying, we want to control the direction of our platform.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.920]   The other one is saying is we want to absolutely control the direction of our platform.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.280]   I'm guessing it's the latter.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   But yeah.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:59.240]   There are some people that are pointing out that one of the issues could be also stuff
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.040]   with the multitasking, with being able to have full control over the apps and what they
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   do in the background, with being able...
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.320]   There's a lot of things that need to be tied in there that they have to follow a bunch
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.400]   of rules.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:16.040]   And there's not a guarantee that they would follow those if they're not built in Xcode
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.960]   because that's code has given you a bunch of libraries.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.400]   But it's also given you the structure that Apple needs you to work within so that it
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.880]   can manage all the things it needs at an OS level.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.800]   These are all coherent arguments.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.520]   And I think that the 37 Signals blog post, finally when it boils down to it, is simply
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:37.680]   this, developers are an independent lot and don't like to be told how they can develop.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   They have their preferences.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.720]   They have the ways they like to do it.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:47.160]   And he says at the end of the post, "It is better to be loved than feared, especially
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.520]   when it comes to developers."
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.160]   And Apple, he says, "has jumped the gun.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.720]   We weren't done loving you before you made us fear you."
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.200]   And I think that that's a legitimate point.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.200]   Oh, God.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:06.600]   Well, I guess as a consumer of the iPhone and as a developer for the iPhone, I strongly
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.800]   feel that if people think this is a bad idea, they should, especially if they think it's
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.720]   a bad idea to develop for Apple because they did this, I definitely think they should just
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.880]   develop for another platform.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.680]   Well, and I wonder is this good for this?
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.120]   This is very good for Android.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:23.320]   In fact, there's a move at Google to support Android development with Ruby and Python and
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.320]   other things.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.320]   And of course, it's not wrong.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.320]   It's not illegal.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.600]   In fact, it's in the house at Google.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.360]   I think the other thing that keeps seeing in a lot of these blog post is the idea that
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:38.000]   Apple is supposed to be your dad.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   It's my dad.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.240]   He's supposed to do everything that I think is good and holy and upright and upstanding
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.920]   that I could never have any qualm with that makes absolute total crystal clear sense to
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.280]   me at first blush.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.080]   And Apple is a business.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.440]   Apple is a business and they're going to do things that are, you don't understand right
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.000]   now that are for the best interests of the users.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   They're also going to do things that you don't understand right now that are solely in the
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.560]   best interests of Apple.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.880]   So if you're going to complain about some of their policies, you really have to complain
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:08.400]   directly about what they're doing and simply not say, Oh man, you give us the iPad and we
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.360]   thought you were gods and now you're telling us that developers can't do what they want
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.960]   to do with the software they want to build.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.120]   Well, again, wake up.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   It's a company.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.120]   It's not your dad.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.440]   Well, I'm just okay.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.360]   So let's make the argument on those terms.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.080]   It may be a bad business decision as well.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.080]   That's something that the developer community will vote on.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.080]   That's something that the consumers are going to vote on.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.080]   And in the end, the people who are going to pay the price are the same people who made
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.080]   that decision.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.080]   It's a very nice, it's a very nice balanced sort of risk-reward sort of thing.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.080]   Here's a surprise.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.080]   Go ahead.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   If you want to go to from Craig Severson finalize this idea.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:51.080]   There's a lot of bifurcation in the idea of there's the developers and then there's
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   the product people.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   I find that a lot.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.080]   The engineering side and the product side and the design side.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   Apple is clearly on the product side.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.080]   They're not necessarily totally focused on the engineering part of things.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   They're making beautiful products.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   They're making things that have emotional responses with people.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.080]   And I think this policy fits right into that.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   I think it is a super long-term decision.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.080]   I think it's probably a very good business decision for them as well.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.080]   But they think differently.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   The geeks get upset when it's not open and it's not all of these things that geeks like.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.080]   But Apple's not making geekdom.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.080]   They're making actual consumer products.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.080]   Excellent point.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.080]   Here's a surprise.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.080]   I thought I was wrong about two things.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.080]   I said Apple will never put multitasking in the iPhone.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.080]   Oh, we should probably talk more about iPhone 4.0.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   And they will never, ever in a million years will they allow Opera to appear on the iPhone.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.080]   What was I wrong on both?
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.080]   Opera Mini today in the iPhone store.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:56.080]   I mean, it's not something I'm not going to run and jump and start using it.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.080]   I think Safari is still superior.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   But people who want to have a choice now have a choice and I never would have credited this to Apple, to be honest.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   Why did they do this?
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   It's super smart to do that too.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.080]   Because it's not as good as Safari.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.080]   Right.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.080]   If it were a threat, they wouldn't have done it.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.080]   Mm-hmm.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.080]   Yep.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:19.080]   I like the idea that we have an alternative browser just to do things like see how well a web page with search would be.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:24.080]   So I can search the contents of the page, all kinds of other features and all kinds of other user interfaces.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:29.080]   In terms of the thing that Opera is supposed to be good at, which is loading in pages super fast,
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:33.080]   I don't think it works all that much better than Safari.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:39.080]   I even tried it on my edge, my old first generation phone to try it under Edge.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.080]   And it didn't really work that much better.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:51.080]   I'm sorry, I turned off the best test to turn off 3G on your, even on your modern phone and see how well it loaded on that really super slow network.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   And it was faster, but it wasn't so fast that's worth downloading another app.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.080]   I love finding the page though.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:01.080]   I mean, God, that's something we need to have real time.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:07.080]   I'm more disappointed that it's not available on the iPad Safari than on the iPhone Safari because I just missed that.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.080]   There is a JavaScript hack, you know, you can add a JavaScript bookmark that will do it, but it's a bit of a hack.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:17.080]   Yeah, but again, the hack and bookmark and JavaScript are three words that should not be associated with searching the text of a web page.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.080]   No, I agree.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.080]   I agree.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.080]   It's snappy.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:27.080]   You know, there's a lot of real estate used by the user interface, but you may be able to turn that off.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   I haven't played with it that much yet.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.080]   It's nice to have a little competition, right?
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.080]   It's the most intimidating to me, though.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.080]   It does, doesn't it?
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:42.080]   One thing Opera Mini does, it's my understanding, is it proxies all the caches, all the graphics.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:52.080]   You're not connecting to the web directly or connected to their servers that cooks up a lower bandwidth version of every site that you want to go through.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:59.080]   And there's enough responsibility to me on what happens on that server that I don't know if I want to do my online banking through that sort of thing.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.080]   Yeah, they actually strip off the certificates.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:07.080]   So you might want to just be aware of that difference when you use Opera Mini.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   I'm just going to log into my webinar and not show you my log in my Twitter.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:16.080]   There is a full screen button I see, so I can go full screen on it.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.080]   I don't know.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.080]   I mean, I won't uninstall it.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.080]   I bet I won't use it much.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.080]   And why do you think Apple did this?
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.080]   You said this was a good idea, Craig.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   Right, it helps diffuse some of the noise that people are complaining that Apple is not open to competitive type apps.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:42.080]   But also, I mean, think of the iPhone whole platform is about this integration and this simplicity that's transparent to the user.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.080]   I mean, excuse me, it's opaque to the user, right?
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.080]   There's no file structure, there's no nothing.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   So all of the things that are going to be happening on the phone are going to default to Safari anyway.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.080]   No one's going to do these hats.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.080]   Right.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   So there's really no harm in letting this thing out.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:00.080]   And there would be more harm in not putting it out, not letting it go out.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.080]   So, simple decision.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   I really wish I knew whether this was as political a decision as that or whether it was a simple question of the versions that they had been submitting had some super secret thing that Apple could not approve, but they made some sort of small modification that just on a technical
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.080]   reason said, great, we don't care whether it's a browser or not.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   I don't care that you were doing this thing improperly or that you were laying things to a proxy and not really identifying that to the user properly and we'll never know.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.080]   Right.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:35.080]   Some say, and I think this might be true, Opera's been very aggressive in the EU pursuing Microsoft like a dog with a bone.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   And some say this might be really just to stay out of the way of the European Union.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080]   And that may make sense.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:54.080]   And because Apple has in the past rejected many in app because they, quote, duplicate a function already in the iPhone and I can't think of a function more clearly duplicated than a browser.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:59.080]   One thing, the one problem that Apple may have is that this does create a little bit more confusion.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:06.080]   It's not the rules, not as clear when they start letting in apps that clearly are duplicating something and then say, now it looks more arbitrary.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:12.080]   Like when they do it all the time and straight through, I think you can have the appearance of being fair.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   When you let some in and then not let other ones in, then it becomes the appearance of, you know, that it might be arbitrary, becomes much more apparent.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:29.080]   By the way, John Sirqza, we've talked to before from ours, I think.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   It says concurs with my thinking that this is a gamble.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:43.080]   It says Apple's decisions regarding its mobile platform in particular have been extremely protective from the very start, obviously.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   Cumulatively, these actions represent a huge bet placed by Apple.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.080]   The proposition is this.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.080]   Apple is betting.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:54.080]   It can grow its platform fast enough using any means necessary.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.080]   The developers will stick around despite all the hardships and shoddy treatment.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   Each time it chooses to do what it thinks is best for the future of the iPhone OS platform, instead of what will please developers, Apple is pushing more chips into the pot.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.080]   You agree?
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.080]   It's a gamble.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:17.080]   And it is shoddy treatment for some developers, but Apple's gambling, they won't care because it's such a strong platform, they will have to develop for it.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:23.080]   I'm not sure if I agree 100% with the idea that developers feel as though they're being treated shoddily.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.080]   They don't like the term.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:35.080]   The ones I talk to, they don't like most of all is the uncertainty of working on an app and not knowing 100% what Apple is going to prove it or not.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:43.080]   They're as many different opinions about Apple as there are different developers, but I don't see what I talk about.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:49.080]   They tell me it's not why am I running for Apple, why am I letting myself be handcuffed like this?
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.080]   Always.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.080]   Uh oh.
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.080]   Andy, we're breaking up a little bit.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   Say that whole sentence again, because that was a good sentence and we lost about half of it.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.080]   Maybe don't say anything at all.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.080]   Just sit there frozen and stunned silence.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.080]   That's all.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   You really still.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.080]   Everybody not move.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.080]   Just wait for Andy to come back.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.080]   And there he goes.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.080]   Boom.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:18.080]   I'm going to get him back because that was a good, what he was saying was good.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:24.080]   And then we'll get to the seven tent poles.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   My phone four point.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.080]   It's a big tent.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.080]   It's a big tent.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.080]   I'm thinking of a tent.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:35.080]   I have a tent like that on my farm on We Rule.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   Oh, to put it down.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.080]   Hey, I harvested the beans and I planted the.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.080]   I'm really glad to hear that.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.080]   Because I think it's good to have a very diet for my little people.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.080]   Yes.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.080]   I'm getting all your updates on your Facebook feed.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.080]   So you don't have to tell me.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.080]   No, We Rule is not sending stuff to Facebook, is it?
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.080]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.080]   Oh, I hope not.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   God, that would be embarrassing.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:00.080]   It's two in the morning and Leo just planted artichokes.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.080]   Oh, dear.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.080]   Andy's not coming.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   I'm getting him back as soon as I can.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.080]   But don't you think that's a pretty little farm?
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:13.080]   I've planted some little extra things to make the people happy, the little people here.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.080]   We've got a picnic table somewhere.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:21.080]   I try to keep the mining and forestry operations away from the houses.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:24.080]   I want them to be a happy.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.080]   Now, there's for some reason there's a giant frog and a wizard here.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.080]   I don't know what's going on there.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.080]   Hello, hello.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.080]   Ah, there we go.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.080]   Andy.
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.080]   See what I touch?
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.080]   I keep all back in a minute and I've done yelling about Skype yet.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:38.080]   I still have some voice left.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.080]   Leo, put it down.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.080]   Sorry.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.080]   Okay.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.080]   I'm just killing time waiting for Andy to come back.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   If you were this, start your camera there.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   Oh, sorry.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   I am Chief Twit on We Rule.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   My plus name is Chief Twit.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.080]   Thank you.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.080]   Thank you very much.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:59.080]   Of course, that's one of the tent poles, isn't it?
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   That Apple will do its own gaming community.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.080]   Yes.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.080]   There we go.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.080]   Okay.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   I want you to start over Andy at the part where you said I've talked to a lot of developers
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   and their reaction is.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   I've talked to a lot of developers and the first words out of their mouths are not, "Oh,
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.080]   Apple's so cruel to us."
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.080]   This is a terrible situation we're in.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   I wish that we had better terms.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   It's always about the apps they want to build, the tools that they get to use.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   They're not at all happy that if there's one thing they're unhappy about, it's that,
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:37.080]   of course, they're going to put all this work in on an app without a 100% guarantee that they will actually be able to sell the fruits of their labors.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   But honestly, I also acknowledge that there are as many different opinions about Apple as there are developers.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   But I really don't get the sense that there is a tortures and pitchfork sort of mentality from the developers.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.080]   They seem to think that they have a business relationship with Apple.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:58.080]   Apple is having the upper hand is going to dictate certain terms of that business arrangement,
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   but it's the arrangement that they are overall willing to undertake.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.080]   Mm-hmm.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.080]   Exactly.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.080]   I think well said, all of you.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   I think we've covered this sufficiently.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:11.080]   Let's talk about the seven tent poles of iPhone 4.0.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.080]   By the way, Gruber got it, I think, 100% right.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.080]   It's almost as if he knew.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.080]   Maybe he and Steve are like buddies.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.080]   Yeah, he's just saying.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.080]   Just listen to John.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.080]   He's kind of, he can be Steve's Joe Ab.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   He can go out there.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   I choose not to speak, but John will do my speaking for me.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.080]   [laughter]
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.080]   Bring me the head of John the Gruber.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   [laughter]
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:42.080]   John said multitasking, and it happened.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.080]   I'm shocked.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   Is it now, Greg, you were saying it's kind of not, it is or it isn't multitasking?
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:53.080]   Well, it depends on how you define it, but I think it's the best way, or it's a good way
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.080]   of doing multitasking for this particular platform.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:58:00.080]   I was nervous because, you know, I have experienced with multitasking phones and they hang and
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.080]   they get slow.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.080]   I didn't want more.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   It's always had it, but I wasn't necessarily dying to have more things except for the classic
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.080]   idea of Pandora.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.080]   And of course, they bring him out on stage with that.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.080]   Immediately.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.080]   Because that was the main kind of use case that most of us are concerned about.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.080]   Right.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:21.080]   Let us play Pandora music in the background as well as iPod music.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.080]   Right.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.080]   On Skype.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.080]   On Skype.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.080]   Like a big thing.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:28.080]   I think that got me more excited than anything else we talked about.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:31.080]   Do you think that's a shot at AT&T?
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.080]   I just think it's a shot that all of us want it.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.080]   I mean, I don't know if they need to do anything against AT&T.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:41.880]   I mean, I just, it's so frustrating to have to keep Skype open and in the front just to
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.080]   make calls.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:49.480]   That was, for me, that was the most important thing that I saw in that whole session.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:54.680]   They really need to improve the notification system though, if you're going to have background
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.680]   processes.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.840]   The notification system on the iPhone currently on the iPad is one at a time.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.640]   It's so much nicer on the Android where you can stack them, you can read a bunch of them,
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   you can clear them.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:12.240]   And they just, you know, I gave out my handle and we rule while we a minute ago.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:18.560]   And now my, basically I can't do anything on my iPad because anytime I try to do something,
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:23.440]   I get a notification from we rule saying, "Oh, somebody's just joined, did we rule?"
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.560]   So it interrupts an application.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:29.160]   If you're playing plants versus zombies in the middle of a very important, you know,
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.040]   and all of a sudden you get a notification that sucks.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.080]   And they're not fixing that, by the way.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.880]   That's not to be fixed.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.480]   I mean, I think Android does exceptionally well.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:44.400]   I think the pre-desert best of all, my problem with the way that Android does it is that
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:48.680]   if you leave your phone alone for 90 minutes, suddenly you've got this huge, huge Venetian
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.680]   blind of stuff.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.840]   And the one thing that you really need to be notified about gets buried in the middle
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:53.840]   of it.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:54.840]   At least they're all there.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:01.760]   So what I'm not concerned about is I'm wondering if the home button at the bottom of the screen
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:05.800]   was designed to be punched as often as it's going to be used, what it becomes, the mechanism
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.960]   for switching between applications.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.360]   Is it press and hold?
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.200]   Because that's kind of what it is.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   It's double press.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.200]   Double press.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.200]   Right.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.200]   To bring up the running apps.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:21.000]   And we already have a sort of behavior on the phone as our mechanism for just getting
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.080]   for one app to another.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.640]   But given that we're not multitasking, we tend not to leave one app and go to another
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.320]   until we feel as though we're kind of done with that app.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:33.160]   When it becomes, and when I've got instant messaging on, I've got my music player on
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:37.240]   when I've got a couple other apps on at the same time, I'm wondering what happens when
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.840]   I'm just clicking this little, this button that probably did not cost $8 per unit.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.640]   I'm double tapping it every like three times a minute.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.600]   No, I killed the button on my 3G.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.640]   And it would, you know, it would go off at a moment's notice.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.640]   So I'm really curious to see.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.120]   When we see the new, the new fourth generation hardware this summer, which I think we all
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.640]   agree we're definitely going to be saying, I'm wondering if we're going to see like an
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.920]   upgraded build just to just to support this sort of stuff.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   Wouldn't you?
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.080]   I'm so glad you're saying that, Andy.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.680]   I thought it was just me being totally weird about the home button.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.440]   I had these same thoughts.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.360]   Even now I don't double click to go back to the home page.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.440]   I flick through just to preserve that button.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440]   Really?
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.080]   But yeah, it's just we either thought it was a weird quirk that, you know, protect the
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.600]   home button, whatever you do.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.880]   The button, but I think Andy's home button security is really good.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.480]   If they do and beef up that button, that would be that would be very smart.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.600]   I do have to admit I approach it as well.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.520]   I bought AppleCare and it's very easy to replace my phone.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.440]   Just back it up.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.240]   I mean, it's not going to be me that's paying for that button.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.680]   It's going to be Apple.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.120]   So this may be really this iPhone 4.0 really may be in support of AppleCare.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.920]   You know, yes.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.120]   It also overclocks the processor.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.360]   We're going to make AppleCare $10 more to cover the fact that we're going to replace
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.360]   the button.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.360]   A lot of buttons.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.360]   Other tent poll.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.360]   Well, so multitasking.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.360]   I think we needed that.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:07.720]   You know, everything that Apple did though, I have to say, was in reaction to other platforms.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.960]   So in reaction to Android, they added multi-t- well, actually everybody because they were
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.040]   the last phone not to do it.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:20.840]   And also in reaction to Android, what are the tent polls?
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.800]   I use the iads.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.840]   But this is a rather reaction to Google.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.840]   That's right.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.480]   Doing its own ad platform since they lost AdMob to Google.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:34.040]   That the unified inbox for mail, which is also reaction to Android.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.320]   That was reaction to Leo.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.320]   Someone was complaining about that.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.920]   You know, they saw our show last week and you were talking about it and they were like,
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.920]   you know, Leo, we're really, you know, just for me.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920]   They did that, huh?
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.360]   Yeah, I think that was actually a Leo.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.520]   Now, you know, I don't care that much about a unified inbox.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.640]   Although on the iPad, it's really is a pain to flick.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.800]   You got to go back, back, back, back, back.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.120]   You got to drill up and down all the time to go to multiple accounts.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.200]   It'd be nice to have one inbox.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.200]   That's nice.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.520]   And I think there are a lot of features that we're not seeing.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.360]   These are just their tent poll features.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.320]   Interestingly, they're going to do a gaming network.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.040]   This is equivalent to Twitter saying we're going to make a Twitter client.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:18.720]   There are a number of very good gaming networks like Plus and OpenFaint already on the iPhone.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.360]   I think the biggest deal of them all, especially with multitasking, is arranging things into
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.360]   folders finally.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.360]   Folders.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.360]   That's a response to it.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.360]   That's an end-to-end response.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.800]   Also, it's interesting that they're making it automatic organizations so that if you want
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:36.040]   to automatically have all your games and all your category apps in the separate folders,
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.720]   that'll handle that automatically.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.360]   But yeah, I mean, all of us have...
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.240]   How soon did it take any of us to max out all the screens we had available here?
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.720]   And so it's definitely going to be...
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.520]   If that's going to be the...
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:55.400]   I sometimes like to sort of part out, do a tear down of all the features that are available
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.760]   on an operating system update.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:02.080]   So if Leopard costs $129 to upgrade, how much is this feature worth?
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.360]   How much is that feature worth?
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.360]   I think already we've got...
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.200]   I'll give you $10 for folders on my iPhone right now.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.440]   This is the beginning of a slippery slope, I think, for Apple's dealing with having all
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.480]   these things on the phone and iPad platforms.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.160]   We're going to start seeing it with documents like an eyewarp where you have to start dealing
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.440]   with and you have a lot of individual bits.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.920]   I think it's going to be a big user experience challenge for them.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.280]   So far, I think Folders is the best idea, but it's a slippery slope.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.720]   It's going to get worse and worse.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.560]   There definitely is a little bit more complexity that's being added in.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.520]   Both with the mechanism for switching between apps and the mechanism for setting up and
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.640]   moving between folders like that, I'm wondering if some of the elegance of the iPhone is going
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.760]   to get lost in that.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.520]   I don't see that being a problem with the iPad, but on the iPhone, I tried myself on the
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.720]   fact that there are features that you can just figure out and discover really, really
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.720]   easy.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   That was kind of my feeling.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.720]   Mm-hmm.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.720]   Right.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.960]   They're going after RIM with better support for business.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.080]   The kinds of things businesses want, like remote installation, remote configuration, two
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:11.520]   exchange servers, better encryption, that kind of thing.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.840]   And they had to do that.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:17.400]   I wonder if they'll make an iPhone without a camera, since many businesses require no
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.400]   cameras on the phone.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.400]   Oh, that's a touch.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   That's a touch, isn't it?
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400]   Kind of sort of.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400]   Well, yeah.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.400]   Get out of the phone.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.200]   Isn't that just as simple as producing a different kind of case back that has no hold
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200]   cut off with the camera?
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.160]   Wouldn't that be more like, look, if you want one, we will charge you an extra $3 to
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.960]   do you know, cover the whole up.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.960]   You can take a picture, but it will be dark.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:45.880]   Well, yeah, because it'll have the exact same camera features as the iPad.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:51.880]   Now, Microsoft this weekend, adds two social phones, the Kin, which are basically their
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.880]   danger phones.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:06:03.120]   They've got, of course, Windows Mobile, Windows 7 phone series coming in the fall.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.680]   So this has gotten to be a very, and I think actually this brings Microsoft back into the
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.680]   game where they've really been failing.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.680]   Palm's gone.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.720]   In fact, Palm, apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal has hired somebody to
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.800]   help put them up for sale.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.080]   So Palm is just, I think history.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080]   What are you buying?
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.760]   I mean, other than the desks.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.760]   What do you?
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.760]   WebOS.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760]   What do you buy?
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.760]   What do you buy?
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.760]   What property have that?
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:29.760]   Somebody, you know what you buy?
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:30.760]   You buy the patents and somebody suggested I think this probably would happen.
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:36.240]   HTC buys them so that they can have mutually assured destruction in their war with Apple.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.240]   That's who's going to buy them.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.240]   They're going to buy them for the patents.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:45.040]   You think I threatened it all from any of these other phones?
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.800]   I mean, I think, I have to say, I give Apple a lot of credit for putting the iPhone out
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.080]   and making a great phone.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.960]   And it took a while, but I think other companies are now responding.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.280]   I think Android's coming on pretty strong.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:01.720]   It does provide an alternative to disgruntled developers that will be, I think, soon.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.000]   Well, maybe not as big as the iPhone, but a good strong platform.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   Microsoft's back.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.120]   I mean, the thing we have to remember is that no matter how big the iPhone market gets is
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.800]   that Apple had a thriving market at 5% of the market.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.360]   It doesn't matter that you, you know, because the smartphone market is the future.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:24.440]   I mean, it'll be everything everywhere, you know, in the not too distant future.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.320]   I mean, you won't go to buy something that doesn't do smart.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.320]   There isn't a smartphone.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.800]   So this is a massive market.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.960]   It's bigger than the computer market.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.320]   And Apple did fine at 5%.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:36.960]   So if the Android gets to 10% or 15% or 20%, that'll be a massive market.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.920]   It'll be very successful in its own right.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.440]   It doesn't have to win.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.440]   Right.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.440]   To win.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.040]   You're totally right, especially in developing countries too.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.800]   Like we're looking at for your Yahoo where we're putting out things for different countries.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:54.120]   And a lot of these developing countries, we're just making the assumption they're not going
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.600]   to have any kind of a laptop or a desktop.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.600]   It's all going to be smartphone.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.000]   We'll be at the platform that they're on.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.720]   So it's going to get bigger.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.720]   Okay.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.720]   Any other tent poles?
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.720]   Let's just venture.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.640]   What do you guys think of the I ads?
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.880]   I think the I ads were actually pretty.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.360]   I mean, I thought that the ads themselves were pretty cool.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.360]   Yeah, I'm not thrilled about anything that puts more ads on my stuff.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360]   Be honest.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.800]   And then when Steve Jobs says, what did he say?
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:22.600]   One billion ad impressions a day, I'm going, Oh God.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.240]   I'm still that impression.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.240]   What did he say?
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.480]   So let's say there is by the end of the year, a hundred million of these iPhone iPod touches
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.720]   and iPads.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:39.960]   And he says each user watches that screen for around half an hour, right, a day.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:43.720]   I'm not sure what this somebody said at every 10 minutes, but I think it's actually three
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.720]   ads.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.800]   I mean, it's it's it's a hundred million times 10 ads.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.120]   So I think it's an ad every three minutes is what he's talking about because he said
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.360]   a billion ad impressions a day.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.720]   I guess all if they were if they were built the way that they showed them there, I mean,
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.240]   the only thing that I was concerned about is is it sounded like they're going to sell
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.240]   all the ads.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.320]   And so it doesn't doesn't seem like I feel like I lose a lot of control.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.800]   If I allow them to put ads on my in my app over the kind of it, I want to have that interactivity.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.840]   When I looked at the interactivity that they had with those ads, that's the kind of stuff
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.440]   that you thought that was cool.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.600]   We did that in Mac break three and a half years ago.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.440]   We're a little thing in the blower third.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.160]   Yeah, I bet there's so little real estate on the phone and maybe that's okay on the iPad,
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.160]   but I hate it.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.160]   And what I know, we'll see.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.480]   I mean, if it's only in free apps, okay, you look, you're getting a free app or a cheap
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.880]   app and it's supported that way.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.560]   But wouldn't it be wouldn't?
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   I hate to see it.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.560]   It's a paid apps.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.160]   You're doing a true 16 by nine image even on the iPhone.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.320]   You actually have 40 I think it's like 40 pixels on the bottom that you could put stuff
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:45.760]   down there and that's just sitting there.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:51.240]   And it would be nice to have Squarespace or Citrix or whatever you wanted that's going
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.440]   down along that bottom area and people can choose to click on it if they want.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.120]   Or it could come up, maybe we can get it.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.520]   And I love the idea that it's not just text.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:06.400]   As someone who wants to use advertising and also, I mean, I'd like to, if Apple can aggregate
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.320]   and I can make money on possibly, I mean, they didn't say that what if they were making
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.240]   money on our podcast, not our podcasts, but somebody's podcast, you put them up there
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.800]   and you get a big following, you don't have to think about the advertising.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.160]   You know, Apple's going to blow stuff in there.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160]   I don't mind it.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.640]   And they take a mere 40%.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.000]   Actually that's industry standard.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   So I'm not.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.280]   That's the whole big deal.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:31.040]   People who otherwise would be thinking, I really need to, I really want to make some money
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.040]   off this app.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.240]   I really want to give away that app for free, but I don't have the time or the expertise
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.200]   to figure out how to choose an ad network, how to support that ad network.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.800]   If it's just a simple standardized thing, we're just like Apple will take care of the
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.240]   marketing and the transaction fees for the sales of my app.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.520]   They'll also handle all the, all the, the, the scutt work involved in putting ads in
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.880]   the app.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.440]   That might make a lot more apps, uh, self-sustainable.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.240]   I think it'll also mean that the, that, uh, if it means more good free apps, that's great.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.120]   It means that my 99 cent apps will also have ads of them.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120]   That's not a good thing for me.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.120]   Right.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:09.040]   Hey, Alex, have they, has Apple, uh, revealed how they're going to deal with the network
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.640]   or how the, uh, people who want to advertise are going to interact with, with them on that.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.720]   Is there any details on that?
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.600]   I don't think they really, I think they just said we're going to do it.
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.000]   I don't think they did this as, as, in they showed some examples.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.200]   It did say, the one thing that I did key on is that we'll sell them all for you.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.920]   So that there was, I was like, you know, um, yeah, but, but at the same time, if they
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.840]   gave us the ability to add those in on our own, but I don't think it doesn't sound like
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:30.840]   they're going to let us.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.320]   And it sounds like we're talking about big advertisers oftentimes or ones that want to
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.320]   target it.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.200]   It's going to be very much like you can buy advertising.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   I don't know.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.440]   It'll be just like Facebook, right?
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.840]   You buy, um, teenagers, you buy women, you buy.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.840]   Right.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840]   Mm hmm.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.120]   So we'll see lots of Coca Cola and that kind of thing.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.120]   Sorry.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.200]   But if I'm putting out podcasts that aren't, that I'm not selling ads for right now, uh,
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:01.080]   and I'm making some extra money on them, I'm not necessarily going to complain about that.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.120]   Well, and I don't mind on a podcast because it's an audio thing that if it takes up some
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.520]   screen real estate, I'm, I'm mind on a game.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.520]   I might not know.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.680]   But I think you'll have, I think as a, as a game developer, you're going to have some
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.000]   opportunities to figure out.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.320]   I don't think it has to be persistent either.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.800]   I think you can probably have it where you want to have it.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.280]   Even with the ones that are out there, some of the ones that are playing with it now,
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.040]   it's not like it's on the whole screen all the time.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.040]   Right.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.120]   You know, it's there at a certain times, uh, and it's there available.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.440]   And I bet you, I bet you you're going to have ways to kind of wire that in on your own.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.440]   All right.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.920]   Well, I'll reserve judgment until I see how it's implemented, I guess.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.480]   I'm excited for it actually, just to see how this might help redefine the cost.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.920]   The quality of ads, the aesthetic quality and the experiential quality of them.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:43.360]   This is something we've been thinking about Alex, you know, back five years ago, like
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.720]   how, how can ads be more interesting and more engaging?
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.640]   And I think it's interesting that, that Apple's going to tackle this.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:54.560]   And it was an emphasis that Steve kept making that, you know, that it, they are going to
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.560]   look nice.
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.960]   They're, they're not going to be intrusive because no one wins with that.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:04.280]   I think some of the examples right now that are working for me, uh, are things like in,
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:09.360]   in Twitter, these in line ads that are graphically very beautiful.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.160]   And as a, you know, visual person, it doesn't bother me.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:16.560]   I actually appreciate the fact that, that these advertisers are making aesthetic decisions
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.080]   and not trying to, you know, blow the thing apart visually.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.600]   Well, and I also think that I, I do think that this is a, it, it is a, um, should be
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:30.520]   scary to, to Google to some, some degree because this is a very valuable segment.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:35.080]   I mean, the people who are willing to pay what we pay for iPads and iPhones and, and
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.120]   applications and everything else, these are consumers that spend a lot of money.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.720]   It is a very valuable segment and you're, you're taking that rich segment and you're
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.720]   taking control of it.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.640]   And I think that that's going to be something that, uh, is problematic for other, uh, you
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.880]   know, add aggregates.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   Mm hmm.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.360]   Let's see what else.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.360]   I work.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360]   I work.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360]   I work.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.360]   Okay.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.240]   I work because Craig Sieversen is here.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.240]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.440]   And Danny should we should put you in, I want to hear what he says.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440]   Now I'm in playing with it.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   I have some complaints.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.880]   I mean, okay, I'm an idiot.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.040]   I was, I'm using, um, uh, I pages.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.040]   Is that what it's called?
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.040]   No, just pages.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.720]   In, uh, in landscape mode.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:27.440]   And I can't find any, I keep tapping it three times and everything.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.440]   What happened?
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.440]   I can't find any controls.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.520]   I find this is a problem with a number of iPad apps because there's no standard, right?
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:35.800]   That's why I keep hitting it with three fingers.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.360]   Cause on some programs, like sketchpad, three fingers does something.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.360]   Right.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.440]   So finally, like an idiot, I finally figure out, oh, you got to be.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.440]   And I don't know.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.720]   And you got to be in portrait mode, but I don't know if that's a good design feature
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.720]   or not.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.400]   I actually think it's not.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.880]   It's confusing for an idiot like me.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.640]   No, I did it first.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.400]   Then I decided I figured out why I think they do.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.400]   I have no idea.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.800]   I didn't talk to anyone there, but I have my, my thing is, is that I do like it once I've
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.040]   decided I'm going to type to turn it and I've set it up and the type away and have a little
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.440]   bit and have as much screen real estate as I possibly can have and not be thinking about
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.440]   anything else.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:15.480]   So the text, I did sink into me that I'm not sure if I hate it.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.360]   I hated it for the first 10 minutes.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.360]   They did exactly.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360]   You did for 10 minutes.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   I said there couldn't figure out like it.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.320]   And it made me feel dumb, which I guess I was.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.320]   No, you weren't.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.040]   That's a total design problem.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:30.360]   However, I do like the idea.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.760]   I'm still of the opinion that the iPad is really a mostly content consumption device.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.160]   It's like TV 2.0 to me.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.160]   And so it puzzled me even at the announcement that Apple was kind of doing these content
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.520]   creation tools because I knew they would be somewhat, I mean, they'd have to be, but
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.440]   necessarily there's no file system, somewhat limited and complicated.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.640]   Like try to print.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.920]   You know, you got to copy it to a computer to print or use it.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.760]   You know, actually my pick of the, I have a couple of picks of the week.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:04.200]   Actually some of them will help you print, but still I just feel like it's really not
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.200]   a content creation device.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.120]   And yet this is what you do, Craig.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.120]   What do you think?
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.120]   Right.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:14.000]   I think I was, when the announcement came out during the keynote that they included
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.560]   iWork to me that completely changed the iPad.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.120]   It was, it was, that was a shocker for me actually.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:25.960]   And the fact that they also allowed the external keyboard because it really started to place
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:32.240]   it into this point of being a something that could substitute your laptop in certain cases.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:39.480]   And I'm a little, the, the naming of the iWork apps as the same name as the desktop apps.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.480]   Right.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:46.200]   I think it's a bit misleading because the functionality isn't at all a mirror.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.720]   It's very much a lightweight version of the desktop apps.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:59.240]   So, you know, I got it right away.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.840]   Really working on it.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:06.240]   And I came in Monday morning, had a presentation, jacked a keynote into the projector and it
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.240]   just worked.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.040]   And it was, it was great.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.520]   And then later in that day I had to create a new presentation and I jumped on the iPad
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.600]   and I stopped because I just could not work with that fluidity.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:25.280]   And so, I'm finding that the way the apps have been designed and how they're working, there's
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.040]   a certain sort of period of time that they're appropriate.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.240]   I think they're very appropriate when you're starting a project and you want to get ideas
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.760]   down, quick, get them down quickly.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.000]   But in the middle, that hard part where you're really building up something, I think you go
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.720]   to the desktop and work on that.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.880]   And then the presentation and the distribution and the showing of the document can go back
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.120]   on the iPad and you can make some small changes if you're on the road.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.640]   I think that's the use case that they designed around.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.880]   And for that purpose, it's quite good.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   What are the problems?
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.520]   Whatever you say you have to be a plane.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.680]   Every all these developers do.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.680]   My favorite word processor is Scrivener that I've spoken so much about.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.000]   The developer is contemplating doing an iPad version and I hope that he doesn't get intimidated
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.240]   by the idea of doing the full Scrivener for iPad because it seems to me as a user, the
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.840]   methodology is just pack me a lunch.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.640]   I don't need to have the full kitchen, just pack me a lunch.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:27.000]   Let me take the project I'm working on right now, pack it up and let me put it on the iPad
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.400]   and a version where I can do meaningful work on, give me an application that will let me
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.720]   do meaningful work on it.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:36.480]   If I don't have every single feature available and then when I get back home, I'll have made
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.200]   forward progress in this project without having to have my full laptop with me.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.200]   Exactly.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.200]   I feel that way.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:47.480]   The other point too that I find with, so now let's take the apps and think of them as standalone
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.520]   content creation devices.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:55.480]   This is the perfect suite of apps for my mother-in-law, which I think the iPad itself is a great
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.760]   replacement for her instead of a netbook.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.200]   Here now she can write letters, very simple ones.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.040]   She could look at spreadsheets or whatever.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:11.640]   It's just that basic functionality from a creation point of view is also really valuable
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.840]   within that context.
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:19.040]   If you want to do real work, you really need to go onto the desktop.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.040]   Okay.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.040]   It's an accessory.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.040]   It's a toy.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.680]   It's a tool, but it's a toy.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.440]   I was concerned because some people had talked about keynotes crashing.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:35.080]   Keynotes that were created on the Mac being brought in and then crashing on the iPad when
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.320]   they were trying to do presentations.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.400]   I tried to build mine completely on the iPad.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:44.480]   One thing that I had, as I said, I couldn't add movies when I was in the iPad version of
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480]   Keynotes.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.000]   Craig, was I missing something?
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.160]   I couldn't find it in the help.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.160]   I didn't see it there.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:56.440]   It seemed that if I want to have movies there, I would have to create them over at the desktop
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.440]   version.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.640]   Did you find that to be the case?
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:03.760]   I found that if I got the movies into my camera on the...
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:09.160]   If I synced it with iTunes in the Photos app, you could put videos in the Photos app and
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:14.000]   then you have access to the Photos app within Keynotes to pull in images.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:20.760]   I put videos in the iPhoto and I couldn't get them to sync up.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.400]   I got them synced to the...
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:27.040]   I said that's a library that I want, but they didn't show me the wrong format that I
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.040]   didn't want to put back.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:36.160]   I'm still teasing out all these use cases with a breaking video in and out, because that
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.960]   was one of the first things that I tried.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.560]   I got it to work and it plays nicely.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:45.160]   That was the only thing I was missing from me as far as putting stuff together.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:48.720]   I forced myself to build the app, build the presentations in Keynote.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:52.920]   I did find that it was probably half the speed at what I do on the desktop.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:57.160]   I did find that it got a lot faster and it was fun when I started realizing all the different
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.760]   finger things that I had to do.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.880]   The shift was cool because you just hold down on something and just click on the other things
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:05.240]   that you want to group select and then move them around.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.600]   Those types of things, by forcing myself to go through it, in a pinch, I could definitely
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.120]   see myself putting stuff together in there.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.600]   I do think it is much faster to do on the desktop, but I think it's also a little bit
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.360]   of learning a new language with my fingers.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.800]   I'm just very fast on the mouse as well.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.360]   You're totally right.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:29.400]   I'm finding it really fascinating how now I'm using, instead of just one point of contact,
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.880]   I have two or three.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.720]   The really interesting things that are happening when you actually start mucking around with
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.000]   data and images, it's a totally different thing, a different part of the brain than
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.160]   using this discrete mouse.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.800]   I think we're seeing just the beginning of it.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:51.920]   I think they did a pretty darn good job given how complex all of these apps are, how they
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.520]   unified the experience on the iPad from an interaction point of view pretty well.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:01.240]   They're some irritating things, but it's 1.0.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.560]   I think that the applications are absolutely necessary for the EDU market.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.040]   Ah, of course.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.680]   You can't sell this to a school unless you have the process.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.080]   You add those plus all the other stuff and you have the perfect school device.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.080]   Right.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.080]   Yep.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.080]   Exactly.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.080]   That's an interesting question.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:23.760]   I'm bringing this to my kids high school tomorrow, to the board of directors meeting
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:29.840]   to show them, because right now they give the kids a laptop, a MacBook.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.280]   I'm wondering if this, I don't know if this would make a good replacement.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.280]   I would replace it.
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.280]   It's half as much.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:37.280]   Really?
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.280]   I don't know.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.360]   It makes sense from an economic point of view, but I was talking to somebody Saturday night
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:48.040]   who was asking me that sort of question where they can either buy a new iBook or a new
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:49.040]   MacBook.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.640]   And my first question was, well, what's what called is your MacBook?
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.800]   And it's still a power PC model.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:58.000]   And I'm saying, okay, so now you're talking about this will have to be your real main
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   computer.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   Right.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   If you had any sort of an Intel MacBook, I could say, well, great.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   It's sturdy enough.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.120]   You can still run Snow Leopard.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.040]   You can still use it to sync stuff up with.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:11.880]   And you can still, you'll still have a credible computer at home, but they were a little bit
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:15.400]   more interested in getting themselves an iPad and trying to use that as their main thing.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   Right.
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.160]   And that you can, you do need to have that tether to a desktop for a couple of pretty
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.160]   key features.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.160]   Right.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.840]   I do think though, that for a school and what they really want to, not only key features
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:28.280]   to turn it on, you need to test it.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:30.120]   You can't even use it.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.840]   But I think which thing do we look at?
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.840]   What I would do is a key feature.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:35.840]   That's a key feature.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.000]   The ability to actually use it for anything requires you to use iTunes.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.640]   I was kind of disappointed by that.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.840]   I bought one from my 80 year old father-in-law and I'm going to have to go down with my
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.720]   laptop to activate it.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.080]   But he's got to back it up.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.640]   So he's got to get him something.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.400]   He doesn't have to back it up.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.400]   Yeah, you do.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.400]   Especially if we're going to be making stuff on it now.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.800]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:04.840]   That's why really to me, it's kind of a poor solution for content creation.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:12.120]   It's the integration of these apps with iWork.com and with iDISK is not there.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.120]   It's really sad.
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.680]   I'm hoping it's an artifact of 1.0.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.120]   I'm hoping they're building it up.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.320]   What would you do to fix it?
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:24.240]   I would have at least a much more better versioning system of how do you keep track
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:30.000]   of what document is actually coming off of the iPad and onto the desktop and back.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.440]   Right now you're just making duplicates of the same file.
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.720]   Groover talked about this and I totally agree with them.
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.320]   It's so quickly, can you have three copies of the same thing?
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.480]   And now all the different places, one's in the iTunes library, one's on your iPad, one's
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.400]   on your desktop, maybe one's even on iWork.com.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.680]   All four are different.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:49.680]   It's a mess.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:55.240]   And I was thinking this is going to be the big user experience problem that they're going
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:00.000]   to be solving is how are these discrete files going to be working on a platform that's so
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.560]   minimized like this.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.560]   I think it can work.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.800]   I was begging on Twitter that Apple by Dropbox this week just to...
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   Oh yeah.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.440]   But they have Dropbox, it's called Mobile Me.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.440]   It just sucks.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:16.160]   Mobile Me doesn't suck, but iDIS, I have not had to go in.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.280]   Oh right, that feature Mobile Me, yeah.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.280]   And what's...
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.160]   Is it odd that iWork is in no way related to Mobile Me?
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.160]   Only it's not...
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.440]   Shouldn't those iWork files be visible on the iDIS?
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:34.120]   iWork.com is a little bit more of a professional context, so you want to have a bit more privacy
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.120]   control.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.000]   Although you can still have it on the iDIS.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.800]   So I do find it a little odd that there...
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.800]   Seems like they've got two different solutions that are...
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.200]   Right, but iWork.com has a lot more previewing features and commenting features and they're
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.640]   much more document oriented than file system oriented.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:55.440]   I think the thing that I think I'm hoping that iWork.com points towards is that I do
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.240]   think that Apple can improve on the idea of a net application, which is that I would
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.360]   much rather buy from iTunes than buy from a web store.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:09.360]   I've said that before, but I'd much rather work in iWork and have it, but have it do the
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:13.320]   same thing essentially that is being done when I use Google Docs, which is that I'm updating
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.840]   an online file.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.280]   I'm not dealing with the web page.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.640]   I'm not in Safari or Firefox.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.200]   I don't need those.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.360]   I just want it to do the same thing where it's connecting to that and Apple can do that
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.360]   with Mobile Me.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:28.400]   They can do it with all these different platforms and I think that they can provide a better
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.800]   user experience than what we get with Google Docs.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.920]   But as it is, we, all of our documents begin in Google Docs when we're working on the
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:40.840]   company because everyone can sit there and make all their adjustments to it.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.840]   It then goes back out to pages.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840]   That's what it could be.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.680]   It could be so close to that.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.960]   It's close to I think Alex, I think it would be a sinking thing rather than offline.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:54.960]   It's you know what the truth is they could do it with it like this because Google Docs
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.520]   does accept arbitrary documents.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.520]   You could put Microsoft Office documents on it.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.560]   All they'd have to do is make a connector.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:05.360]   In fact, maybe some third party could do this.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.320]   Then you'd be done and you have your iWork documents there.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.000]   You can connect Google Docs.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.400]   There are a lot of programs to connect Google Docs to the iPad.
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.400]   Read only.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.320]   Yeah, it's kind of a funky solution.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:21.980]   I think the thing that we're sort of universally missing here is that the iPad needs a version
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.160]   of the Finder.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:27.160]   Not necessarily the actual Apple Finder, but it sort of shows us how important it is to
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.600]   have some sort of essential file oriented concierge.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:31.600]   See, I disagree.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.160]   Well, no, well, so I disagree with your disagreement.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.040]   I think that an application like air sharing is going to be very, very necessary to be
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:46.240]   that one place where you can deal with entities as they exist as files, not necessarily as
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.280]   data that's associated with a different app.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.080]   And that application is the one that connects to iDesc or connects to your Dropbox or connects
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:56.640]   to your box.net account and makes those files visible to other apps and will act as a centralized
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:01.080]   sync service to all these other applications that are on side of the device.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.640]   We've tried to get buy without that for the past couple of weeks, and now we just sort
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:10.000]   of realize that we need to be able to deal with files as files.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.080]   Even if all of this version control, that's going to be a very, very important thing.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:17.720]   If you want to use it as a content creation device, and that's where my disagreement is.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.640]   Oh, I think anybody's going to want to use it as everybody is going to want it, use it
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:23.200]   as a content creation device.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:28.680]   It's one of the classic use models of this thing for me from day one has always been,
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.720]   this is the device I'm going to take with me wherever I go, whenever I don't.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.360]   I just want to be able to watch movies or listen to music in my car or whatever.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.360]   But you know what?
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:39.680]   It's 1.30 in the afternoon in Apple or Microsoft has just announced something and I need to
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.760]   get 500 words written and published.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.160]   So thank God I have the ability to create and publish.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.880]   Thank God I have the ability when I get finally this book chapter that I'm sort of wrestling
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.480]   with for the past two or three days.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.920]   I know how the damn thing starts, I can at least write down those first three or four
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:54.920]   points.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:55.920]   You can do that.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.520]   Well, that's content that did not exist until I created it.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.520]   Hence, content creation.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.840]   Yeah, but this is my feeling is that this and I have a feeling there's a debate with
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:07.240]   even within Apple because you feel a little schizophrenia over this.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.640]   Now we're going to make it simple.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.920]   We're not going to have any file system.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.920]   We're not going to have any backup issues.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.560]   We're not going to you don't even know that their files are being created.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.560]   Oh, but we're going to give you some content creation tools and third party tools too as
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.560]   well.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.600]   I mean, there's quite a few drawing tools.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:27.160]   So that kind of muddies the waters and I think that adds complexity.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:31.640]   I guess if you have the thing I like about things like air sharing is well, if somebody
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:34.720]   wants this capability, if you want to add it under the hood and you know what's going
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:41.240]   on, but when I give it to say my wife or my father in law, I like it that they don't
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.040]   have this complexity.
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:47.000]   The content creation that they're doing is email at best.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.360]   It's function related.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.360]   It's not.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.500]   I mean, this is the whole the whole vibe around the iPad.
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:54.840]   It's about what are you doing?
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:57.080]   The function of the app takes up the whole screen.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.320]   It takes up your whole experience.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:01.600]   It's modal, which is funny because that's what Apple was against in the early days.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.600]   Exactly.
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:05.960]   But you're thinking about the content or you're thinking about the app.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:09.360]   You're not really thinking about you don't want to be thinking about the files.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:13.960]   I would agree, Andy, that I think a central repository is probably going to be necessary.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:18.520]   But do you think that should be revealed to the casual user?
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.960]   I think that should be like the center.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:24.680]   I think that the centerpiece of the iPad experience should be springboard.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680]   It should not be.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:29.240]   Here's a list of all your files on the device.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:34.200]   I do think that if Apple doesn't do it, then there's going to be about a five-way battle
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:37.560]   between five really big manufacturers to make an app like that.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.640]   And then that's going to be the de facto thing.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:44.640]   Just take a look at this six months from now and find out that if you have eight people
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:49.120]   with iPads in the room, how many people will have an app like earsharing just to manage
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.400]   files and just to read files?
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.280]   I think there's going to be at least six out of eight are going to have those apps.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.000]   That's as good a vote as you can possibly see.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.400]   As long as pages and keynote can access that earsharing file or that folder.
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:06.720]   See, I can't wait for really good third-party office type apps to come out.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:11.640]   That's when pages and keynote and numbers have to really start finding for survival.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:17.280]   I talked last week about a conversation I had with the folks who do a box.net that they
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:22.920]   have APIs so that third-party developers can write iPad apps and iPhone apps that can
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:28.040]   just sort of transparently access cloud stores that's available on box.net.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:32.840]   And if I come across a really good word processor that simply can natively say, "Oh, here's
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.960]   your folder of all the arbitrary files you put in your box.net share," I will read from
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.840]   them, I will write to them.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:44.840]   And then when I soon as I get back, so I don't ever have to explicitly sync the contents
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:48.080]   of this project folder for my desktop up to the iPad.
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:51.200]   I never have to explicitly sync it right back down again.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:55.400]   Box.net or whoever does that sort of a service, they, boy, they become the Microsoft of that
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.400]   product category.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.400]   Got to go.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.040]   And that's what we wish I work.com would be.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:09.280]   So anyone use the external keyboard and one of your experiences with that works great.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:13.840]   I was really shocked by the fact that I was really pleased back in January to find that
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:17.000]   the Command and Key equivalents for cut copy and paste were great.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.880]   And so I sit down, I launch pages and I crack my knuckles and I say, "Well, I guess Command
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:21.880]   B is going to work.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:22.880]   No, Command B doesn't do anything.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.200]   Well, Command I to a tileset.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.200]   No, Command I doesn't do anything."
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:31.680]   That all these Command Key equivalents, especially in the context of if Apple, if I
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:37.440]   have taken the time to plug in an external keyboard, either via Bluetooth or mechanically,
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:42.040]   chances are I don't want to have to reach up and tap a bold face button or more likely.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:47.400]   I'm not going to have to reach up, turn the side ways, tap the bold face button, turn
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:51.160]   it back on its side, put it back down on my easel and start tapping the typing again.
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.160]   That's just dumb.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:58.080]   These are exactly the things I was curious about when waiting for this thing to come out
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:03.880]   is the actual, the ergonomics and the actual feeling of reaching up to do stuff and this
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.200]   touch back and forth.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:09.080]   It kind of goes back to this thing I was talking about with the general function of
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.080]   the apps.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.280]   It's something you start with and you end with.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:17.080]   With typing I found that I get everything set up and if I want to start typing, then
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.080]   I'll just type.
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.920]   And if there's a lot of errors, I'll just go back to them later.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:28.040]   But I really find that reaching up or reaching over to do simple things is not quite right.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.880]   But it's great if I just want to spew out a bunch of words, I'll pull out the other
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.120]   keyboard and go.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.000]   Well, it's not perfect.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.600]   I guess Andy, you want it to be more like a laptop or a netbook.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.080]   I just like it to be a TV.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.080]   With some.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:48.880]   I just, last week, I cannot count how many times I was asked for a quick synopsis of
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.040]   how good or how bad the iPad is at this conference.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.920]   And it really helped me to sort of narrow down what I like about the iPad.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:01.960]   And it's the fact that it is a blank screen upon which any software can project any feature
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.960]   that I need at any given moment.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:08.160]   So I don't need it to be a notebook, but I need it to be something that I can write
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.160]   800 words on.
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.840]   I need it to be pretty capable.
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.080]   So I don't necessarily need Microsoft Word.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.560]   But if I had, let's say, text edit on it, so I can create and edit Word documents with
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:22.160]   not big formatting, but just give me limited style, give me limited font control and let
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.600]   me hit command B off the keyboard.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:30.520]   The other thing I can't believe that I missed is the having a tab key on the virtual keyboard,
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:33.880]   because there are times when you just want to do a little bit of formatting or you're
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.840]   trying to move the cursor from one place to another.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:41.320]   And I instinctively was typing my ring finger to the left of the keyboard and say, okay,
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.400]   well, I just typed a queue there instead of having over to the side there.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.880]   So I can't wait for other versions of mobile Word apps.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:52.560]   That's going to be a game changer for me.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.560]   You do, I mean, pages, as you know, opens up Word docs.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:00.520]   And I was somewhat delighted to be getting Word docs and email, double clicking them,
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.840]   and then I get a preview screen and then I can open it and pages right away.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.800]   That was really, that was fluid.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:06.800]   That worked.
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.360]   I'm disappointed that the Word files that Scrivener exports apparently are not compatible
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:14.960]   with pages because it simply tells me that it's an invalid file type.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.960]   So I'm fine.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:19.800]   Well, and I know that's my fault because there's a Word doc is not a Word doc is not
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.800]   a Word doc right now.
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:25.920]   I'm going through three different kinds between Office 90 Office of seven, the XML version
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.360]   of Office.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:31.120]   But I have to sort of think a little bit carefully before I export a file to know that it's going
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.920]   to be something that I can edit then on the iPad.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.240]   All right, we have to work.
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.240]   Boy, this is a long show.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.680]   Of course, there's a lot to talk about.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.440]   Thank you, Apple for saving it all up.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:46.000]   Dumping it all on the same time.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.920]   But we boys, this is a great conversation.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.160]   We'll do we'll do some more.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.200]   Craig, we're going to get to our picks of the week.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.160]   If you want to prepare one, you're welcome to.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.320]   You could also do a tip if you want to do something with I work.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:56.320]   It's up to you.
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.320]   Okay.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:01.120]   Before we do that, let's we do have a pick from audible.com.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.120]   Audibles are great.
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.120]   Oh, audible.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:06.120]   Oh, that's the kind of case.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:09.440]   It's the kind of innocent audible.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.440]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:14.200]   You can get a free book by signing up for that gold account and canceled anytime with
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:22.200]   a book is yours forever runs great on all your I devices, your phone, pad, touch, pod, whatever
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:24.120]   it is that you have also runs.
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:29.440]   If you're one of those weird listeners, it has a zoom runs on the Kindle runs on GPS
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:30.840]   devices, a lot of devices.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.920]   If you go to we don't morally judge, we just they just want your money.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:37.480]   They just want your money doesn't run on the droid yet still working on that.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.960]   Can't wait.
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.280]   Although I have to say who knows it may be moot because when I the new iPhone comes out,
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.600]   I may well switch back in June if it's like that all this if it had if it has a five
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:51.040]   megapixel camera and an OLED screen.
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.400]   I'm there.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:37:00.280]   That's all that's all I ask either way I listen to audible all the time I listen to it when
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.680]   I go to bed and listen to it when I oh by the way there scratch your head when I there
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.680]   you go Andy.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.120]   I was just checking to see who's whose followers are stupid or yours or mine.
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:14.120]   Apparently, Leo LaPortz fans are more stupid than a not goes fans just by quite a bit.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.680]   I prefer to think that my fans are more intelligent than yours.
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.360]   They're smart as a whip.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.480]   Mine are thick as two short planks.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.920]   Just so you know.
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.720]   That's the the famous stupid fight.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:30.400]   Isn't that actually like the name of your fan club the Leo LaPortz sack of doorknobs?
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:33.480]   Or is it the bag of hammers?
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.800]   You know how they figure out who's stupider who who's fans talk back to them more.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.600]   In the presumption being if your celebrity your fans will only stupid people would talk
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.600]   to you.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:47.240]   You see Leo that's that's where it helps to for my position to make lots and lots of
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:48.880]   mistakes.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.400]   Factual mistakes grammatical errors just you know stuff like that.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.240]   They'll talk back to you and you'll get that score way back up.
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:00.800]   Actually it says we use several stupid indicators including multiple exclamation marks endlessly
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.600]   abbreviating OMG.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:05.600]   Do they do it all in caps?
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:10.760]   So we're seeing a little little tangent prejudice here aren't we?
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:13.600]   I see lots of sentences ended with prepositions.
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600]   Clearly fool.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.360]   There must be some Eastern Europeans in their fanbase.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.360]   Oh god.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.320]   That god of that.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.880]   Not a William and Mary grads but by any major episode.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.600]   So app audible where do we go?
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.560]   I've got lost some here with with this silly stupid battle.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:38.000]   Go to the device center you can see all the devices that Apple or audible supports it
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:44.080]   from Amazon Apple co-op creative higher insignia I river belt on and on and on and on including
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.880]   sandus the sands is all of the most popular devices.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:49.400]   Now once you get the book you can listen on your computer or you can copy it over to
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.200]   your device listen wherever you go.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:55.440]   The files are fairly small they do have a new enhanced format that's much bigger but
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.560]   now that we have a lot of storage it's not so much bigger that it means you can't store
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:03.480]   about hundred books on most portable devices and you're going to want a hundred books as
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.320]   soon as you start browsing around audible.com you start to say wow I'd like to listen that
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:11.320]   oh I want to always want to read oh my goodness I meant to read that in high school I never
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.320]   got around to it.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.280]   I mean it just goes on and on I'm excited about kitty Kelly's biography of Oprah looking
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:23.760]   forward to reading that never did have time to read that 20 hour magnum opress but I will
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.600]   be I will be reading it maybe Andy you have a better recommendation though save me Andy.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:32.160]   Well the Oprah still has a number of shows left I'm still hoping to get booked on the
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:37.120]   show so until then I am not going to support kitty Kelly's book even indirectly.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.000]   Smart man I'm in your fan club Oprah.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000]   Love you Oprah.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.800]   Coming up this year I could really use your support.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:47.280]   Let me just see yeah we're just money in a box Oprah that will do me just fine.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.560]   Compare your followers to Oprah's followers.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:55.960]   Hey this might be an old audible pick but have you listened to pattern recognition by
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.680]   William Gibson as the audio book.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:59.920]   I've read it I've never listened is it a good audio book.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:04.080]   It's a really good audio book the reader is wonderful a woman who does it and she sets
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.040]   just the right tone so it's one of those books that that really translates well into
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:12.640]   audio and really translates well because she's just doing a perfect job it's just it's I
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:16.840]   think it's one of Gibson's better books and I just really really enjoy have been enjoying
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:17.840]   the audible version.
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.840]   I'm putting it on my list right now that's that's great.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:27.000]   Pattern recognition by William Gibson they don't have neuromancer I think.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.280]   No I mean there's you know he did his own version of that which I have.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.360]   Corey Doctor wrote past it on to me is no longer in print.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.640]   It's rather difficult to listen to.
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.640]   Kind of coffee.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.120]   Not good.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:43.320]   That's where you really you better appreciate the talent.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:48.080]   Yeah exactly audible really has great actors reading Shelley Frazier does this is good I'm
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.920]   going to I'm going to yeah she's great I'm going to get this one Andy you have something
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:55.280]   oh look they've got an FM now on audible oh no that's exciting.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.160]   Yeah that's long it was it's been out for a while.
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.080]   I guess it came out day and day didn't it.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:02.800]   Thirty two hours and thirty minutes.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:08.400]   So long that they actually had to have four narrators to actually die during the recording
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:13.080]   of it because of the union rules of course they have to record it all in one session
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:15.640]   or else they pay the studio double.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.640]   That's right.
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:19.680]   So it's like one of those 1920s dance competitions.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.760]   I love that book so much I really did I might have to get that on the audio and listen to
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.760]   it again.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.280]   There's a lot of good choices Andy do you want to throw one in to the mix.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.520]   I do have a pick if you want to save it for next week I'll save it for next week we already
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.520]   have two really good.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:37.200]   I can't let's let's oh you know people are going to say but what you gave me too many
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:42.400]   choices I can't I can't choose I I well well listen that's one of the many problems you
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:48.680]   will face when faced with the unending quality and breadth of content available on audible.com
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.680]   it's so true.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:53.960]   It's such a wide range of talented voice professionals reading it to.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.800]   It's why you'll almost want to kill yourself.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:58.680]   But don't don't please.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:05.080]   Automals well one lovely lovely audible book audible.com slash Mac break your chance to
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.560]   try it today.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:07.720]   We're not suggesting suicide.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:08.720]   We really are.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:15.360]   That's never the answer never the answer unless you're Hitler and I think you're not.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:18.920]   How come these audible ads always degenerated to something like isn't that God wins law
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:21.680]   that eventually all audible ads will.
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:25.280]   I don't want to be responsible like maybe like Hitler's out there like his brains in
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.240]   a journey thinking of finally ending it okay and I'm responsible for giving him the
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.960]   you know the will to live I don't think so.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:34.520]   I want that in my conscious Leo.
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:35.520]   Automals.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:41.040]   It is slash Mac break Alex Lindsey you're an AB you got to pick from an AB or do something
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.000]   more pedestrian.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.920]   I have a I don't have a pick from an AB because I think that I'm gonna stick with my iPad and
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:53.920]   one of the things hard not to pick stuff on the iPad is I know it's a whole new little
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.640]   area that we can talk about that so the I actually want to pick two books to take a
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:05.120]   look at and but one that I just think is I think that they point to you know a lot of
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.280]   these we're not I mean I think the I books are gonna be great for people who really like
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:11.680]   that book experience but I've talked to a lot of people who are developing and I think
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:14.480]   I talked about this on the shows that they really feel like if you have a big picture
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:18.800]   book it's not really the the best format for it and so people are building their own
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:23.080]   apps but one of the things I I'm really interested in as as we start to see books is books that
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:29.520]   start to break that that break the all of what a book is and one of the ones that I think
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:34.400]   is simple but very effective is cat in the hat have you seen cat in the hat no I don't
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:39.360]   really have occasion to buy it I have well on top of being a big doctor Seuss you know
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:45.520]   I grew up obviously all of all of them but I'm I love doctor Seuss and and and so I got
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.840]   cat in the hat for my son so I can so we can sit and you know get cat in all it needed
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:55.920]   to do was just change the pages and I would have been happy but instead what they added
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.240]   was what what really to me started pointing towards the future of what's gonna happen
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:04.560]   with books just the beginning which is you can when you click on it you got these little
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:08.720]   floating things you can have it read to you you can read it yourself you can set it to
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:13.200]   autoplay and it'll it'll you know do all of those things and but when you when you say
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.840]   you want to read it yours you know read it when you click on it it actually sometimes
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:22.360]   when you when you flick your and starts off simple you just changes the words with the
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:28.560]   same photo but then when you start moving on it'll start doing zooms so you see it zooms
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:31.480]   back and then the and then the and then the text appears so it makes it a little bit
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:35.640]   more of an interactive experience also when you click on the books it says books when
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:41.200]   you click on the milk it says milk I mean the thing is it's great it's a great little
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.160]   experience that I can play with my son it's way more than a book or it's becoming a fair
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.360]   bit more more than a book I think another one that that I saw that I wanted to talk about
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:54.480]   was Alice you know I can't wait to get that yeah I got it and it I have to say it's a little
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:58.440]   gimmicky it's a little gimmicky that it's a little physics simulator that you can play
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:05.360]   with and it's it's also nine dollars right although there's a free version I guess I would download
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:08.680]   the free version my pick is for the free version because you can see the gimmicks and you can
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.520]   play with it I'm not sure if it totally works it's not I'm not sure I bought the regular
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:18.800]   one but but I have to say that both of these things point towards this idea of moving past
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:22.280]   just have just changing a page and I think this is just the beginning we're gonna put
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:27.000]   seeing these baby steps we're gonna see people take too many steps sometimes but I'm pretty
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.320]   excited about you know about books and about interactivity and about really changing that
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:36.920]   nature of course elements which I think we talked about already is just stunning and so
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:41.760]   anyway I just wanted to pick that with with these you know my friend Jeff Jarvis on this
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:47.160]   week in Google says it's just starting up content and and and elements is a good example
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:52.840]   where you buy it you play with it for a while and then it's like okay now what well well
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:56.600]   I think for someone not in school it's not as big of a deal but I think that for me somebody
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:00.640]   who's studying the periodic table of the elements this would be when I showed this to a I showed
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:04.280]   this to a chemistry teacher and she was like I'm getting she's buying the iPad so that she
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:08.920]   can do that yeah you know that you can show students the only thing that's a bummer here
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:12.000]   is I don't know if it will be able to output you know I think for teachers what you want
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.040]   is to make sure that you can output that a whole interface to a VGA so they can you
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:20.640]   hey we've meant to talk about this maybe Craig you know what is the I have the VGA adapter
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:26.560]   which haven't played right what is it update output to it's only apples limited the port
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.960]   as as per usual so it's only spitting out stuff that's when you're in presentation mode
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:35.920]   and keynote and when you're playing videos but it's not so elements you couldn't use
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.200]   elements on this on a big screen then we're but I really got it I was sort of speculating
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:44.600]   that they would they would include it with the photos app but they didn't I think that
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:49.080]   would be a the natural third use case for no it it does work with photos they can't you
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.600]   when you enter into slide show mode right oh does that the trick the trick with the external
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:58.280]   display is that it's supported by software so it has to have a function that the developer
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:02.520]   of that app wanted to support oh it's not gonna automatically mirror what happens on
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.640]   your iPad directly to the screen so there could be an update to elements that would
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:10.640]   make this display so if the first if elements wanted to have a presentation motor or teaching
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:15.440]   mode they could definitely do that but really that's easy yes yes we're sorry go ahead
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:20.760]   Craig I'm sorry interrupted you but that is open in the SDK for people to do Apple tells
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:24.200]   me that it is an external device that they have to support directly and they have to
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:27.800]   choose exactly the context in which it is supported so that is not something they have
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:32.680]   to do a hack for to anything really weird with that's good enough that's that's the
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:36.600]   reason why like if you are in the in the photos app the screen will be completely black until
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:41.040]   you start a slide show in which case it will be all your photos will go on to that screen
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:46.400]   and super high resolution okay yeah I was I was I didn't know that that's great it's
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:51.800]   a beautiful app is just YouTube app works that way too that that was the one my I mentioned
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:56.640]   one whiskey tango foxtrot moment my entire week of having it in advance and that was
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:59.640]   the you know that those moments where you're like well of course this is going to be the
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.880]   great thing that I'm going to be using this for so of course I know this this is going
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:08.440]   to work exactly the way I expected to but as a formality of course I have to like when
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:12.080]   I plug it into the VGA I have to start up that one of these movies viewing it just so
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:18.160]   I can see it and luxury is HD what I was trying to watch upper Star Trek and iTunes protected
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:23.080]   content and of course I started up the movie and it told me this display is not authorized
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:29.560]   to play this content because VGA is an analog output it will not allow because of course
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:34.160]   I'm going to you know put in some alligator clips onto that cable and make sure that power
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:38.600]   movie of course it never would have occurred to Apple but someone's going to want to actually
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.480]   watch you know the movie that they've just paid twenty dollars for directly from their
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.000]   iPad onto the screen that's just and that was just the dumbest thing ever if it's un-etted
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.000]   content it'll work just fine so guess what I did I downloaded an illegal version of
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.800]   a film you can't excuse me rather rather I took my my own legally purchased blue ray
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.560]   of up you put it on a PC that allows me to rip Blu-ray content and HD.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.560]   That's still illegal.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:07.200]   That's not well in the in the Democratic Republic of Andy it is.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:11.400]   That's stupid why would I why would I not have the expectation that if I have a VGA
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:16.760]   display that can drive HD video that I'm just I'm still pissed off about it I'm sorry.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:19.040]   So Alex what do I do to make it do stuff.
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.000]   Go to the there you go now swing now smooth your iPad with your iPad this will swing but
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.880]   turn it turn it like it's it's you can move further it but it's a physics simulator so
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.480]   it's not animated right go to another page there's a bottle I think on the next one you
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:34.960]   can really is the bottle.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:36.280]   This is one of my favorite.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:37.280]   Oh here we go.
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.200]   So if I turn it upside down the little little you know it's around that one's not very good
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:47.080]   because it's too stable actually it it's hard to get it to fall but the bottle tends to
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.720]   be.
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:52.920]   Then there's this it doesn't here's the problem with the Alice this is why I said it's a little
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:57.040]   gimmicky is it does this but it doesn't let you what you really want to do is touch that
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:01.120]   right you know in the bottle falls and if you if you roll your iPad around the bottle will
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:05.720]   fall around I just like the I like the idea of being able to you know add things that you
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:10.840]   can play with it so I like this as a as a thought I'm not sure if I'm totally sold on
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.840]   it as a book.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:16.760]   It's kind of like a pop up book that but you have no I have to say it's beautiful though
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:18.400]   and it is gorgeous.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.440]   This is my favorite book as a kids.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:23.440]   Not sure what that one does.
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:26.000]   Just do I think it's just not.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.120]   Just kind of in there.
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:30.120]   Alice in the door.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:32.880]   But I can imagine reading this reading this to my kids or something and thinking that it
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:35.960]   was you know funny the blue pill the red pill.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.480]   Yeah I mean kids would love this.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.440]   But you know what kids would want to do it though and that's the thing that's the whole
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:41.440]   thing.
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:42.440]   Go back to the pills go back to the pills.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:46.560]   I think that if you turn it upside down they all kind of are falling.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:49.120]   Yeah the dodo is offering her.
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:51.720]   And you can.
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:55.240]   And the dodo is there and you can kind of have it flow around the dodo.
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:58.800]   Yeah it's the I mean this is the free version so you didn't spend anything for it.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:02.640]   I don't know what you get with the paid version nine dollar paid version but that's pretty
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:03.640]   impressive.
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:09.080]   I said the free version is definitely worth downloading just to just to see where the
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:11.200]   going goes bill.
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.560]   I think it's there's there's an opportunity here.
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.800]   This is just the beginning right.
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:20.560]   Anyway it doesn't want to pick cool Craig you got to pick for us.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:26.480]   I do and at the risk of sounding like a corporate whore I actually would like to pick the Yahoo
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.560]   Entertainment app for the iPad.
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:31.240]   That's one of the featured apps so you're not alone on that.
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:36.760]   Right and what I find interesting what I think is really great about it is that it's
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:41.040]   sort of it's following in with this whole argument that's been going on about web standards
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.760]   HTML5 and Flash.
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:45.000]   This is all HTML5 and WebKit.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:46.400]   Oh interesting.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.440]   So the I think they did a great job.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:52.880]   It was a skunk works project that the design team did here to get it out.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:58.640]   They used a literal setting which in design is usually anathema something you don't want
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:00.960]   to do but I think they actually pulled it off.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:03.080]   Like it's a TV screen you're saying.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.200]   Yeah it's like a T it's literal.
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:10.960]   But they did it in such a way that it actually was the first sort of naive literal interpretation
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:14.120]   of an interface that didn't completely irritate me.
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:19.680]   It actually sort of worked and I think the iPad is a part of that platform and that whole
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.240]   feeling part of it really made sense.
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:24.840]   But I think they did a wonderful job.
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.320]   It's free.
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.320]   It's free.
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:34.360]   It's really showing where we as Yahoo but also as developers are going to go with web
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.920]   interfaces and how rich they can be.
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:43.400]   It is an app but like I say most of it is powered by WebKit and HTML5 and I think that's super
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.400]   impressive.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:52.160]   In fact we already noticing a diminution of flash sites as companies realize.
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:56.200]   I mean after all you want to work on these platforms that's 85 million potential users
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.040]   on a mobile platform.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:02.840]   Or as a Virgin America user I want to book my flight which I now can do on my phone.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:03.840]   Yeah it's huge.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:05.600]   I mean it's really huge.
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:09.840]   And I think that for better or worse Apple has definitely dealt a death blow to flash
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.320]   on the web.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:14.120]   Andy Inaco your pick.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:20.840]   By the way that's Yahoo entertainment and it is free from the iPad store.
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.320]   Yes.
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:26.320]   Andy we don't hear you.
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:27.760]   We don't hear a word you're saying.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:28.760]   Sorry about that.
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:35.440]   I was playing around with a very very audio-ish based application of the iPad.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:42.240]   So I got two things that are sort of in the same family that are both sort of born for
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:47.880]   my inability to find a good case so yet that I really like for the iPad.
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.640]   Because one of the things are that if you're going to be traveling with this you definitely
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:54.880]   want to be able to use it in different situations including have it sort of stood up so you can
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.640]   type on it.
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:02.400]   One time there are two that aren't had.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.400]   You're breaking up again Andy.
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:04.400]   Let me call you right back.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:07.760]   I just want to call you right back because you're going to die.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.760]   You're going to die.
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:09.760]   He's going to die.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:10.760]   He died.
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:11.760]   I'm losing.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:18.040]   Let me call you right back Andy.
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:19.840]   Wish I could share him some of my bandwidth here.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:21.280]   I know you've got so much.
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:25.520]   I touched the end of the ethernet cable here and got a little shock.
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:26.520]   So much.
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:31.040]   I'm very interested because Eric Schmidt at a Los Angeles party this week said yeah we're
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:36.520]   doing an iPad or slate based on Android not on the Chromium OS.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:40.200]   I thought was very interesting.
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:44.000]   And I think if they do it right they could be compelling.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.440]   I just think the challenge for them is standardization.
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:52.440]   I really think that they're going to have a hard time dealing with many versions of
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:56.200]   phones and many versions of pads and everything else is in Android and not knowing what you
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:57.680]   combine the store.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:58.880]   You know that that's really going to work.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:00.760]   I mean I think that Apple just did.
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:04.720]   No, no this is this is a pad Google is going to make.
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:07.560]   Google says we are going to manufacture our own.
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:11.480]   I know but what if someone else there's other people making pads that are based on the Android.
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.480]   Right.
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:19.440]   But Google what if Google I mean Google will be definitive implementation right Google
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:22.320]   makes a compelling pad you just buy it from Google and you don't worry about these other
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:23.320]   guys.
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.320]   Right.
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:28.840]   I just I just realized how super long we are.
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:29.840]   So I'm not going to do two.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:30.840]   I'm just going to do the one.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:33.680]   Yeah, we're we're like I'm sorry about that.
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:37.480]   Well, if I just realized how super you're fault, I haven't even gotten a CS5 yet.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:39.680]   There was just a ton of stuff to talk about.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:41.200]   Not your fault.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:45.360]   Okay, Andy and I co king of the wild frontier.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:47.160]   I was your pick.
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:49.120]   My coons can cap today.
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:52.680]   I still haven't found a stand that I really, really like that's iPad specific.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:54.120]   I know that lots of them are coming.
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:59.720]   I've seen artists conceptions of them on various maker sites, but haven't actually used one
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:00.720]   yet.
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:05.360]   So I've actually come up with a stopgap measure that I like so much that it might be
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:08.640]   part of my regular iPad travel kit.
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:11.360]   It is available at any good hardware store.
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:16.880]   It is a pair of black rubber stoppers.
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:21.680]   What I like about them is that I'm going to use my I rise or part of my I rise or pad
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:22.680]   to show you.
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:26.240]   The cool thing about them is that they're rubber so that they're grippy at the top and
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.320]   at the bottom.
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:31.060]   So what you do is you just simply set them down on your table or surface and then you
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:36.240]   set down your iPad on top of it and it holds it at a perfect thing.
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:38.280]   Angle just like that.
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:42.440]   Also it lifts it lifts it up just enough off the table so that if you're using it to just
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:48.800]   read books or or view movies, that's also almost the exact right perfect angle for that.
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:51.640]   The other thing that I found out because I thought that that was just gonna make clever
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:54.600]   excuse for just putting this on the table when giving my talks.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:57.640]   The other thing is that once again, they're grippy at the top.
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:58.920]   They're grippy at the bottom.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:04.480]   So if you want to what I was listening to music later, I was listening to music all day
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.080]   with this as I was writing on my map book on my bed.
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:11.720]   And I just simply wanted to lean this against the window sill so I could like see what song
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:17.080]   is playing and also reach over and change the program if I want.
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.720]   All I did was I just, but if you just lean this against the window sill or something,
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:24.920]   the bottom is just gonna slide off because it's all this slick aluminum.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:28.440]   But with these two feet on the bottom of there, again, it simply grips it.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:32.680]   And so I could simply lean it against the sill like that and it just doesn't move at
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:33.680]   all.
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:36.880]   Even when I was reaching over and like touching buttons and touching the home screen, it just
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:38.400]   does not move.
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:39.640]   It's very, very good.
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:41.880]   The win it has two other winning features.
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:46.480]   You can get them for if you if the hardware store has the ones made a cheap rubber that
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.440]   costs five bucks for the pair.
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:51.840]   If they are made out of really good rubber like this, they're 10 bucks a pair.
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:53.480]   But so it's not terribly expensive.
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.760]   But here's the really great thing about it.
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:59.560]   Here's when you're not using it, it takes up this much space in your pocket or inside
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:00.560]   your bag.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.080]   You're not dealing with this big chunk, this big like marine Webster's dictionary sort
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:07.360]   of folding collection of wires and gauges and things like that.
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:09.720]   It's just it takes up next to no space.
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:13.160]   So I was using this on, I was using this, giving my talks.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.640]   I was using this in my room.
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:19.280]   I was using this on the tray table of the plane when I was flying over.
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:20.480]   And I really don't.
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:24.240]   I hate to tell everybody who's been spending thousands of dollars in these mockups and
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.440]   prototypes and marketing.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:30.700]   But you have to this is the solution for me to be these two these two hardware store
[01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:35.000]   rubber stoppers because they're useful for a whole bunch of different things and they
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.720]   take up no space whatsoever when you're not using them.
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:39.520]   So that's my pick of the week.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.520]   Cool.
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:41.520]   Cool.
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:45.080]   My pick of the week is yet another time waster.
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:46.080]   Actually, there's several.
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:51.680]   We mentioned a couple of things that probably people should take a look at on the iPad.
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:56.600]   Air sharing is very useful, very smart, very well implemented.
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:59:02.040]   It allows you via Wi-Fi via web dev to log in to share files.
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:06.960]   It doesn't seem to see the unfortunately the folders that I work a storing stuff in.
[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:08.960]   That's kind of a problem.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:12.200]   They're still literally they're going to they're going to opt.
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:16.320]   I talked to a lot of these companies are making these apps and they're saying, please stick
[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:20.040]   with us until 1.1 because we really had to get this done very quickly.
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:21.040]   I understand it.
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:22.760]   It's certainly worth getting even as it is.
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:25.160]   It's a good way to transfer files to the iPhone version.
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:27.840]   So I'm really hopeful about the iPad version of air sharing.
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:28.840]   Love it.
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:29.840]   Good reader.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:32.800]   Of course, we mentioned last week is a must have and we were talking, you know, I keep
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:36.400]   playing this Wii rule game and somebody in the chat room suggested he said, if you like
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:40.160]   Wii rule, you'll love Godfinger.
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:45.040]   Alex, Alex, stay well away.
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.560]   I'm already scared.
[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.840]   This is like pocket God times a million.
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:53.000]   When they were when they were touring as the opening act for AC DC 1985, love them.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.240]   Hardest metal I have ever heard in my life.
[01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:56.560]   A big hair band.
[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:02.840]   So Godfinger and by the way, turn off the social social networking features because I've
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:07.920]   already accidentally tweeted and Facebooked way too much stuff about Godfinger.
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:08.920]   Here is your world.
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.640]   You have a little world.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.920]   This is like pocket God only.
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:15.120]   It's much better really because yes, you could you're not really terrorizing them.
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:17.120]   You're trying to make them happy.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:18.920]   So I've just got a new follower on the mountaintop.
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.520]   I'm going to bring them over to the totem.
[02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:21.520]   They're worshiping me.
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:22.520]   That gives me mana.
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:24.080]   Mana is good with mana.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:25.080]   You can go to the store.
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:30.240]   Actually, you can trade mana for gold and then you can buy things in the store, including
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:32.520]   all points, which are very handy to have people.
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:34.520]   The more all you have is a campfire.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:38.120]   Here's a farm a little later on when I get to level five, I'll be able to buy a fountain
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:40.120]   amid evil well, a barn.
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.680]   You can buy more followers.
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.760]   You can help your followers out.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:46.120]   You can resurrect dead followers.
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.480]   Do you watch this?
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:49.640]   I'm just going to make it rain.
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:50.760]   Do they sacrifice to you?
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:52.240]   They can.
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:53.240]   I don't know what they do.
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:54.440]   I'm going to make it rain watch.
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:58.840]   So you press and hold the cloud till it charges up and then you go like that and it rains
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.680]   and look things sprout up.
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:02.480]   I am God.
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:07.840]   I'm concerned that the kids who grew up playing games like this, I'm going to have to hire
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.640]   them and manage them and make them do things that I want them to do after they've spent
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:14.840]   their entire formative years saying, you can't stop me.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:15.840]   I'm all powerful.
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:16.840]   I can play on world.
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:17.840]   I will not make photocopy.
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:19.840]   You are any other one.
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.960]   I am a God.
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:29.080]   So if you played Populis or Black versus White, you'll be very familiar with the kinds
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:33.760]   of concepts here, but I think it's really nicely implemented.
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:38.000]   And this stays alive in the background and yes, notifications up the wazoo, I turned them
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.040]   off because it tells you everything that's going on.
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.880]   How God feels about all your prayers during football season.
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:43.880]   You've got more.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:45.040]   I've got other things to do.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.040]   I don't want more.
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.040]   Thank you very much.
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:49.040]   Let me drop this follower on the fire here.
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:50.040]   He can work on that.
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:51.040]   Thank you very much.
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:52.040]   He's an unnamed worshiper.
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:55.360]   I presume at some point I'm going to get to name him.
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:59.040]   But this he's just chilling here and you can tap on and see how he's doing.
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:00.960]   You can find out more information about him.
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:05.480]   It's got a 48 minutes old.
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:06.960]   I can name him after a friend.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:09.720]   Let me name him Andy.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:15.320]   So actually these are the friends in the social network that this is part of plus.
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:18.240]   So I'm going to name him after Tom Merritt probably.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:20.800]   But anyway, and I can go to the store and buy him some things.
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:26.640]   If you know replenishes energy, I can have him work longer.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.600]   I'm telling you, this is just don't call me for another couple of weeks, guys.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:31.600]   I'm busy.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:34.920]   I just wanted this is a pick art intervention.
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:37.160]   I'm crying for help.
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:41.080]   More things are springing up on my little planet.
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:44.840]   I imagine after a while the planet gets even more sophisticated.
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:46.480]   But I just started.
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:50.520]   It definitely looks addicting, which is why I'm going to I'm just going to stop at the
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:51.520]   gate.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.520]   Stay away.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:56.560]   This is called God of finger and it's free.
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:57.560]   Wow.
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:00.560]   Well, you know, it's one of those things where they make money by selling you mana and stuff
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:01.560]   like that.
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:04.080]   I guess there's some ads in it, but not very many.
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:06.240]   They make up they make up for it in quantity.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:07.240]   So there's it now.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.240]   See this?
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.240]   I don't mind.
[02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:10.240]   This is a little ad and maybe this is what the ads are going to look like.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:11.440]   I guess it is on I ads.
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:16.160]   It's just a little ad you tap there and it it doesn't you don't exit the thing, but it
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.200]   brings out a larger page and that kind of thing.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:21.680]   I think this is that's good.
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:24.640]   It's a little confused about its orientation.
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:25.640]   I don't understand.
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:27.240]   As are many of our listeners.
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:28.240]   All right.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:29.240]   All right.
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:31.720]   Let me just put that away.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:34.560]   And so you see it's you get the idea.
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.560]   I get the idea.
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.480]   Yeah, definitely a problem, but they're so cute.
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:38.480]   The followers.
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:42.160]   I get the idea that you're going to be 45 minutes late for next week's tape.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:43.160]   What?
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:44.120]   I wasn't paying any attention.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:45.120]   I'm sorry.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:46.120]   Exactly.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:47.120]   God finger.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.840]   Now the way steam is now out in beta.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:52.440]   We were mentioning that Apple's going to have steam for Macintosh users.
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:53.440]   Not Apple.
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:57.880]   Steam is going to make this amazing PC gaming platform available.
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:01.840]   It is now in beta and you can go there and sign up if you already have a steam account
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:02.840]   or create a new steam account.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:05.560]   I haven't seen what games are on there yet because I really thought I should pay more
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:07.440]   attention to this show.
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:10.360]   We did not talk about CS5, but you know what?
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:16.120]   I'm going to make this a good thing because that gives you time to play with it, right?
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:17.120]   Feature.
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:18.120]   I'm just shipping it.
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:19.120]   Yeah, you can get it today.
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:25.640]   If any of us have any time after having finished recording this eight hour show.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:26.640]   The magic fill.
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:27.640]   Lots of new features.
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:28.640]   I think you could get.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:29.640]   I don't know.
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.640]   Am I wrong?
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:31.640]   Can you not?
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:32.640]   It's out.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:33.640]   It's out.
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:34.640]   That's what I thought.
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.640]   I thought today this morning it came out shipping mid May.
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:36.640]   Okay.
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:37.640]   But can you download it?
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:38.640]   I don't know.
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.120]   Can you just maybe the demos?
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:47.040]   Let's pretend it's not out because we just have this is already a two hour show and counting.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:48.200]   Thank you my friends for being here.

[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:05.160]   Oh, good.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:07.800]   It's kind of resurrecting the old Mac break tech.
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:08.800]   Fantastic.
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.760]   But if he thought this show was long, just listen to us.
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:16.800]   We rambled for as long as we want on some very, very geeky subjects.

[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:34.480]   It's John's world that he talks about what he wants to talk about.
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:35.960]   And I'm just there to subtitle it.
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:36.960]   Sounds good.
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:37.960]   Sounds good.
[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:38.960]   Yeah.
