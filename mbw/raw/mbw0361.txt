[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers Apple and Macintosh needs and as web 2028 just said in our chatroom
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.960]   I enjoy the program, but maybe you should go on hiatus until actually Apple announces anything to talk about
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.440]   But there's always something to talk about. That's Alex Lindsey who says there is and you're right always something
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.880]   We always come in we come into every one of these going there's nothing to talk about and then we talk about
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.200]   About nothing weird period where well there's stuff to talk about but soon will be in because now we have the quarterly results and stuff
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.960]   But soon they'll be in the weird period where we're just waiting for Apple to make it an ass and that is next month probably
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.320]   That's Renee Richie's also here for i'm or to calm calm good the good news about Renee is that he already knows what Apple's gonna
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.000]   Say so we're set
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.360]   We'll just ask him and then he'll tug his ear or something like that. He's the king of the Apple rumors. Hi Renee
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.280]   Hey, how are you all pat one of those imaginary dogs that Andy keeps using it so useful?
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.760]   Actually, I think it's been tough has it not for the rumor mill Tim Cook seems to have locked things down a little bit
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.800]   I mean it depends on the kind of rumors
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.680]   So the only hard thing for me is that I agree to the nda and then I can't talk about a bunch of stuff that people find out through
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.440]   Code code sniffing as opposed to actual, you know, those kind of leaks, but it's still been an interesting couple months
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.120]   I'm never doing another nda and he and not co is here from the chicago suntimes
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.920]   He writes for a living so he has to do nda's because there's a there's things like deadlines and lead time
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.840]   Yes, and they are bummers and on many levels although Renee and you sign the nda
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.960]   But you have the picture of a certain screenshot of certain nda software os product right there on the screen behind you
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.920]   It's a fake taken from apple.com. So i'm okay. Oh, this is pure manipulation of press photos
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.200]   It's it's it's a parody. Yes
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.040]   It's a derivative similar to but not identical to
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.280]   And it confuses people because there's no carrier symbols on them. No, the apples pictures have carrier symbols. So yeah, so what are we supposed to infer from that?
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   No more carriers. It's true that apple has kept a very good lid
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.000]   They've they've dealt the you know and Tim Cook said this a year ago
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.320]   I'm gonna double down on secrecy and they've done it in the u.s
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.560]   Very hard with suppliers. Yeah, and that's what Motorola told me. They said I said, you know
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.720]   I promised not to leak anything at this event that I didn't attend and then
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   They said well, we're not so much worried about you. The problem is the carriers all have the phone
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.680]   Right and you can and they the carriers a lot of people will see it and they really can't keep it
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.800]   Well, and the problem is is that there's a lot of single suppliers
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.960]   So, you know, you can't something gets out of fox con. It's not like you can say what do you do?
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.800]   Business somewhere else screw you. Yeah, I mean
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.600]   You you you pretty much have to go. We're really disappointed that you did that last week
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   We saw a and you probably saw this from a a
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.480]   picture of a glass plate
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.040]   That it was clearly in a fox con or some chinese plant for the
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.240]   W for the tenochia wide screen nokia windows phone
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.360]   And it said you know, I mean you can't how are you gonna stop that?
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.840]   My favorite last week is the supplier that they did a report on labor conditions at not fox con but I forget the name the other factory
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.440]   Yeah, and they were talking about apple assembling the low-cost plastic iPhone in the report three different places
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.560]   You can't help it when those labor guys come in there and uh, right
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.480]   Do they talk about specs or anything like that?
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.560]   No, but I mean some people said all is the three gs
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   But the three gs was discontinued that you know he applied a coating to the back of the plastic phone apple soon to be delivered plastic phone is gonna
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   Oh my god
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.760]   So if they're building it a pegatron
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.800]   That would mean what shipping september october
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   Well, let's just make sure that's why they're not building it megatron. Then we really
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.520]   I want a transformer phone
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.680]   It's a really an algae name right the optimist and they got to have a megatron next
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.800]   Yes, so last week google had an event where they announced a new uh, seven inch, uh tablet the next is seven. They announced uh
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.120]   android 4.3
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.120]   They announced um
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.760]   Chromecast which goes straight app against apple tv not as capable yet, but potentially could be a threatening
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.800]   Uh this week uh motor roll is gonna have its event on thursday and he's going to that
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.680]   Uh, and we'll finally see the moto x phone. Although that's been leaked like crazy. I don't know actually I do know there's some stuff that has not been leaked
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.480]   Uh, some very interesting stuff that's not been leaked. So there will be some some root product reveal a little bit
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.160]   Um and I get just the feeling that it's one of those you ever see you ever go to the ufc
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.760]   ultimate fighting championship and you got one guy it's attacking attacking attacking the other guy's just kind of
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.960]   Backing up and not fighting and it's a silver. It's a silver
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.640]   It's a silver approach right and people hate silver because he wins
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.080]   Right because he just waits and waits and then he goes bump and the guy falls over
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   Except last time except he didn't last time and I I I feel like that's what's happening right now
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.640]   If google and apple were in the ring together, right google's just going bam bam bam
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   and apple's just you know
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.320]   Actually, I don't even see apple doing anything apple just like
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.760]   Yeah, but apple
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:37.000]   This is google's in the same position that apple was in like four years ago five years ago where apple didn't have a phone
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.560]   They didn't have a tablet. They didn't have a tv solution. They didn't have a really good video store
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.680]   At least they're they're starting to pick up but they it wasn't really there yet
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:51.560]   And so it's big news when google really releases a tv product that isn't you know, piece of junk and it's affordable and it's actually useful
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.240]   It's big news when they come out with a tablet that's better than the one they that's significantly better than the one they have before
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.480]   It's that's that's the problem with apples quote success right now that once you have
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.360]   There's a wonderful period of building and then you have the house you have the garage you have the yard landscape
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.120]   You have the pool you have the jacuzzi just want to live now exactly
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.800]   And it's like can't we just like you know keep keep the pool clean and maybe we'll put a trampoline in the backyard
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.280]   But do we have to now put in a rocket port?
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.600]   Is this gonna have to be like the Baxter building every time we we we create something new it has to totally change the building
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.960]   I do have to say though that in the tech industry keeping up with the jones is or in this case keeping up with the googles is
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.800]   Is kind of important right or not maybe not maybe for maybe just for us because we're tech journalists
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.240]   I don't say she will maw. I think that the interesting thing is I think that apple
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   I mean I think there is a pressure to
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.120]   Continue to innovate, but I think that what's interesting about apples. They're not really trying to do what everyone else is doing
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.240]   They're not trying to copy anybody else. They're thinking about what they want to add to the next
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.440]   You know the next layer of whatever they're doing. It sounds like
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.680]   Is it a fingerprint is gonna be one of those things? I don't know if I believe that
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.000]   Hmm. We'll see we'll see I don't but you know, but but you're right Alex
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.640]   I mean now it's now that you have all these things here
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.080]   It's new you no longer have to build build infrastructure now
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.560]   You can do do things that take advantage of that infrastructure
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:18.120]   So now's the time for something like I work in the cloud because now you have a multitude of devices that can eat that can easily accept and
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.680]   Accept a I work display windows and editing windows. What can you do with that?
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.400]   What can you what can you do with apple tv as a presentation device not only and as a game device
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.320]   Not only as a way of the 11th way in your house to access Netflix
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.640]   Yeah, and I'm kind of
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.600]   Amaze that we haven't seen something especially with games where your iPhone is really a controller for your eye
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.520]   There's an apple tv for games. Yeah, you guys would play multi person for the apple tv
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.200]   No, but like the iPad though when I
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.760]   I think they don't let you do that on the app. I know I feel like I feel like there's the I
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.880]   And I'm you know, there's probably some big grand plan that I'm that you know that we don't know about but
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.520]   I'm kind of amazed that you have an iOS device sitting on all these uh TVs that they don't
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.080]   let you
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.840]   You know, just install apps
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.320]   I mean apps on your tv. I think would be pretty revolutionary
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.560]   You know, I mean and I think that um, I mean the tv manufacturers are trying to do that
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.640]   And they haven't been very successful because I don't even know how to do it
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.840]   I have every tv I have I think has apps and I don't know how to get to them
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.800]   Um, but I know how to get to my apple tv and if there were games on there, I could play angry birds with my kids
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.960]   I know using my using that would be
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.120]   I think that that's a game changer. You know, I don't think you need to build a tv to do that
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.160]   I think you have an app tv
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.920]   And uh programming world there too. They're they're kind of opposing philosophies
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:38.600]   Uh one of which is gaining a scintency which is build fast break it and fix it right build release fix build release fix
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.320]   And it's a iterative cycle and we've seen it now
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.800]   Uh produce some really amazing things on the web very very very very quickly
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:52.680]   Google's clearly adopted that philosophy whereas apple is more old school where build it perfect it but do it so in private
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   And then release it the problem with that is you don't get real people hammering on it
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.800]   In the quantity that you'd like to see I think microsoft
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.600]   Felt prey to that and they have a very wide open beta
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.640]   But nevertheless windows 8 really showed a lack of insight into what its end users were looking for heads 8.1
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.960]   I feel like that what google has done
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.240]   Uh, you know google yeah google tv crap
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:21.640]   Not crap actually. I liked it, but not what people were looking for wasn't it just it just wasn't a it wasn't an evocative product
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.280]   The queue then follows it and is so bad and so overpriced. It's never even released
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.600]   And then crumb cast and it feels to me
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.240]   It's it's one of those guys who's in it's in the on deck circle. He's got massive forearms
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.840]   And he's scary looking right and he's it it looks like he could step to the plate and hit it out of the park
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.920]   And it's it's all potential right now because it's only netflix youtube google
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.520]   Uh stuff google play right and pretend eventually it's gonna be pandora vimeo apparently is on the way
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:59.640]   H us only and it's us on well us only you know what all tv products start that way just because of the crazy rights
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.480]   Oh my gosh, it's it's insane
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:08.120]   But google doesn't have to stay us only because google's doing something so different from the way apple tv is and remember when apple tv came out
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   I said god. I wish they'd let us buy apps
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.280]   Right if it's ios make it ios and I said the same thing on google tv
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.640]   They kind of had app stores, but you had it was like you had to be designed for tv
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:25.000]   So it was very limited this now any app that's playing on ios or android can be chromecast enabled the stk and api are open
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.120]   Easily adopted our own hudini seven is working right now in the twit tv app
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.480]   Actually, i'd love to get feedback from you kraig when you when you get a chance how hard this is it doesn't look hard
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.320]   if suddenly
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.400]   All of your apps on ios and android and on on chrome all the extensions
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   Work with the chromecast the universe of potential is huge
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.360]   Yeah, that's that's the that's the really scary thing from the point of view of anybody who's you know
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.040]   Whose career is invested in apple tv that this is a device that costs 35 stinking dollars
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.160]   $3
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:03.720]   $5 for the cost of one apple tv you can conceivably have every tv in your house setup for chromecast
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:10.280]   And you when you're buying it you're buying it with the with the knowledge that it's not going to be a huge deal for hd
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.440]   HBO go to be delivered to this device. They don't have to make a deal with apple
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.400]   They don't for make a deal with roku that the the owners of
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.200]   Chromecast don't have to push out a system update
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.680]   It's just that hbo has to make the decision that they want this to happen on their on their mobile app and it happens
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:32.120]   the matter of fact the and so essentially that means that this could this device could come up to speed
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:38.200]   Way way faster than the apple tv took look how long it took for for apple tv to get hbo
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.840]   Which is one of the seminal apps for streaming video?
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:47.160]   It looks like the only real limitation that this device has is does hbo have certain deals
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:55.080]   Is this an intimate enough tv device that hbo's deals with with it's with the cable companies would kind of screw up
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.320]   They're they're supporting it and right now it looks like that's not the case
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:05.000]   But I have been told by by attorneys that you never know how deep it is a lot a lot of times
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.240]   It's it's a lot like a mob city turf
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.520]   It's not so much what will fly what won't fly but you have to make sure that you're not going to offend
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:18.760]   One of your friendly business partners by supporting something before that they've communicated that yes, don't find go ahead support this device
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.560]   We work we don't care. Yeah, because they did that with google tv there hulu who lulu blocked it almost
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.320]   Yeah, and this I mean right now it looks like it's hard because you can just broadcast anything from chrome to the chrome tv
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:35.000]   But you know these and he is saying an idyllic future that I wish we all lived in but the content providers have shown over and over again
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.040]   They're so changed adverse so fearful and so controlling that you know hbo made this aside
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.040]   We don't want to be on google tv. We've got to talk here's what's happening. No, no, no with this
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.120]   Finders want to do this
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.480]   But they can't because they need the money from the cable companies and they know they get cut off
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.120]   But what what google's doing is saying okay, no problem. We'll wait
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.840]   We're just going to give you a great platform
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.280]   And when you feel like the time has come that you could flip that switch and say okay
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.160]   Screw you cable companies because we never did like you because they don't
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.400]   HBO would love to sell direct. Yeah now they can I mean just do the cable
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:18.200]   I just have I just have to correct something the the problem that the cable that hbo and that what hulu and the other companies had with google tv
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.760]   Was that the way that box was designed google could get was aware of what?
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.600]   Programming people were using and they did not want to share that kind of audience information and ad revenue with with google
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.400]   This is a device where the controlling app is still the app on that mobile device
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.600]   So you can theory that exactly every all that that android won't have any particular
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.200]   if if if if hulu had no problem with
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.800]   google
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.000]   Knowing quote-unquote what people are doing with the hulu plus app
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.160]   Then that's clearly a problem that they already solved because they released that app for android
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.600]   So I don't think that's a that's a block that any kind of a block similar to what happened with with google tv
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.920]   Google acknowledges this they've put in drm and in android 4.3
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.240]   Specifically to make companies like netflix
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:09.320]   And I think that the crumpcast has drm built this because you could we were trying to hook it to a recorder yesterday. Oh interesting
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.280]   Oh, you are bad
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.960]   Evil man
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.360]   It was the natural thing to do like hey, I've got a little thing I can just plug in and and no
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.280]   It's just a matter of time and I think google's playing the long game on this is clear
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.960]   They are a lot with google tv and then q and then this it's iterative
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.960]   Thing with an x-7 the first x-7 was very interesting because it was 200 bucks
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.920]   But it didn't compete with an a ipad mini
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:39.160]   This not only competes it kicks the case ipad minis, but and by the way guys you are the ones who are told me you can't do a retina display
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.360]   At that at a reasonable price you can't you can't have enough battery life
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.080]   323 dots per inch
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.680]   $229 10 hours battery life. What are they giving up?
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:56.840]   No, it's different though because that has three quarters of the pixels of a retina ipad mini and it gets nine tenths of the battery life
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.080]   So i'm not saying it's impossible, but it's a different mathematical equation if you add 25 percent
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.640]   More pixels to that and you have to light them and you have to get battery life. It's okay
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.400]   So it's the form it's a four three form factor that's that's holding apple back
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:15.720]   It's a it's a smaller resolution. It's an s a 1080p tablet the apple tablet would be 2048 by 1356
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.840]   Which is way more than I mean if you do the math, it's it's almost
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.320]   Sorry, I'm sorry. I was I was gonna I was gonna back you up there that
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.720]   Whereas android has the ability to essentially make whatever screen dimensions
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:33.480]   They want because the apps that are gonna be cast into that will simply reflow to fit whatever container it's in apple
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.840]   For now really is locked into it has to be an ipad dimension screen. It has to be almost exactly like
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.480]   uh like uh, whatever the pixel dimensions are on every other ipad that's out there and that's what
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.760]   Prevents them through from cutting any corners that way rest by the way. That's of course
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.520]   All true
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:56.600]   But a consumer going into the market is not sinking. Well, you know, this would be a retina display if only it would four point three
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.880]   They're going wow that looks freaking amazing. It's what no you're at a 20 bucks. Oh my god
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.800]   I I mean this thing but I don't know I mean and I and I think this is particularly that the this mini tablet is
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:15.240]   Attacks a particular vulnerability because you really there android still can't do anything to compete with a full-sized ipad
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.400]   To me and this is this is my opinion people can disagree with it, but I'm very very confident about this
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:26.760]   Both the ipad mini and the nexus seven have a sub perfect answer to the question of how do you create tablet apps for a smaller screen
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:33.320]   Because as we all know there are very few very few tablet optimum nexus seven optimized apps out there
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:39.640]   The good news is that this method of reflowing a mobile app so that it fits those dimensions actually works well
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.320]   There are very very few true failures where it's just seems like a scaled up phone app
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.880]   But it's still not really taking advantage of that to
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.480]   If you're using an ipad mini you're getting the full library of ipad apps
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.120]   But I don't believe that that's an optimal experience
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.760]   I I do believe this really was designed for a 9.7 inch screen and when you scale it down
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.280]   One of the reasons why I don't really use my ipad mini on a day-to-day basis is that time and time again
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.080]   I'll get to that point where okay, let's search for this. Ah damn it and my soul just breaks a little bit
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:16.120]   Because I know that I'm going to have to now spend the next 13 seconds of my life trying to figure out how to tap that little circle with an x in it
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.080]   That I can hit every single time on the full size tablet
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.880]   But on the on the small size tablet when you scale it all the way down is just like trying to shoot out
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.960]   Like the the star in the middle of the paper
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.640]   At a circus midway you never get the you never get it perfect
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   You never win the doll and always takes me 11 tries before I get it correctly
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.320]   So two sub optimal experiences if you put two of them side by side
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.000]   Particularly when you look at the non retinist green versus a retina screen
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.360]   100 bucks less the apps look bigger and they look a little bit a little bit easier to read and the less cluttered
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:56.120]   This that's that's the only point in which the weak quote weakness unquote of of an ipad interface starts to make you lean a little bit towards
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.960]   To the next seven I think a lot of people will anyway
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.120]   You know the nicest things about the seven is that the new one gets rid of tv dpi
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.760]   Which was the resolution the target resolution for developers on the original nexus seven
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:13.080]   Which was so bad even google told them not to use it and to use fragments instead where this now has a proper screen resolution
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.800]   So developers if they want to uh, yeah, sure they can reflow, but they can also target and a lot of developers
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.520]   Especially like the pocket like the pocket casts and the the ones who really care about their apps
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.560]   They want to make those specific interfaces and now they can I think that's going to greatly increase the quality of the software for the device
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.760]   You know
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.480]   Made an unusual choice with scaling
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.360]   You make this you make that excellent point because a lot of people say oh you're problem with andro
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.440]   There's no tablet apps
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:45.080]   Is a very ios centric way of thinking of things because as you said andy app scale beautifully on and right and it doesn't become an issue
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.920]   Yeah, I mean there
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.680]   Right. I mean there because it's not designed
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.280]   It's not that they make the text bigger
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.520]   It means that the container that the text is meant to go in gets bigger and it and the text reflow
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.920]   So because most apps are designed to let you set whatever the most comfortable text size is
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.320]   There it's I don't think it's as big as an issue as people think and also I came
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:08.040]   I I kind of encountered this just the other day it arrived like first thing thursday morning
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.120]   I was going out to dinner like later on that night
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.480]   And I was shocked to find out because I oh this is actually not only does this fit in my back pocket
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.840]   It actually fits in my shirt pocket. I mean not completely but I could close it. Yeah, I can carry it
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.240]   I can actually hold the carry it in my shirt pocket
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.880]   So I don't feel feel like i'm gonna break it when I sit down on top of it
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:33.960]   The iPad mini is just big enough that I almost still usually have to have a special case for it
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:39.800]   I do wear these these special like 5-1-1 tactical pants that have pockets
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.320]   They're they're so big that I do
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:41.720]   I do
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.000]   Yeah, I know I have one one of these before they before they modify the design slightly
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.400]   There's one pair in the collection that I can actually just barely get a full-sized iPad into but those don't count
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.560]   And when you when you
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.920]   When you show people that this is small enough that you will you will be able to simply carry this and whatever piece of clothing
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.520]   Whatever jacket pocket you have
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.560]   You're not gonna have to come in with your winter wardrobe to make sure that this is gonna fit in your inside jacket pocket
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:13.480]   There are a lot of really there are a lot of interesting things that make that I really think that the make the nexus 7
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.440]   Exactly as good as the iPad mini for different reasons, of course
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.600]   But I think that you can't really say that one is better than the other
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.440]   Well, it's we still have the original nexus 7 and I stopped using it just because they didn't have landscape support at launch
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.600]   And they didn't have lt and I use my iPad as the world's biggest
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.640]   My fi all the time and they solve both those problems because it looks like it, you know, this they even put the logo
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:43.240]   Horizontally now for landscape and it's not a cellular. It's like them saying. Yeah, it really you really do want this
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.640]   You know they rotated the logo
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.000]   So this isn't a google show
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.600]   But but the point being that apple is I think a little bit on the ropes and I think when you see this new moto x phone
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.840]   Do people are saying many of the same thing? There's a lot of pressure. I think also I think a lot of people would say on the ropes
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.600]   No
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.280]   I would say that now they rest just a couple of years ago
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.040]   Even just a couple of years ago. I would have to say for instance about the iPhone that well
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   This is the best phone you can buy if for whatever reason. This is not the right phone for you
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.880]   Here are some alternatives
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.040]   Now in category after category after category, they don't really walk away with the win
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.720]   It's it's like larry bird in the last six six years of his career
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.040]   I'm sorry the the start of the end of his career meaning that he's still incredibly
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.600]   Incredibly competitive, but he's not
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.560]   There's not an implicit understanding that if he's on the court he's gonna get the ball and he's gonna
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.200]   Put put put points on the board apple really does have to
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:47.000]   Walk its way through every single argument that no here is why the iPad mini is still the best small tablet you can buy
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.400]   Here is why the iPhone 5s the iPhone 6 is still the best phone you can buy you can't just they can't just simply blow past
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.760]   We think it's the best camera and every phone ever made it then move on to that your new you know is done bull store opening
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.760]   They really have to now sell those points here is why you buy an apple device and it's not just because of magic pixie does
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.520]   It's because of so much thought that we put into it and the features that you get from it
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.920]   The interesting thing to me is how you know, I Apple's monetized software with the app store
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.360]   And that means that people buy more iPhones because oh look so much cheap software to use
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:24.760]   And google knows exactly how to hurt apple they put out new stuff before apple does their products like also apple stuff looks as old and outdated as possible when they release it
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.480]   And they put the they put the price as low as possible because google doesn't make their money off hardware
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.840]   And buying a lot of cheap hardware helps people use google services
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:38.760]   So the chrome cast can be 35 bucks and this tablet can be 229 because google's making their money off of services amazon
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.280]   It's very hard for apple. Yeah, absolutely and that's very hard for apple to compete against because they're making their money off hardware margins
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.880]   Well, but I and I wonder how much of apples business is well
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.600]   It's changing because they're making so much money on itunes now that maybe they are becoming more of a service
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.200]   But but I also think that I think that the two big markets for apple
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:02.680]   You know when when they're thinking about their products and I don't know what they're thinking but but my opinion what they're thinking is
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.640]   Number one are people who already own apple products. So, you know, I'm so you know like for my day-to-day
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.320]   I mean I I ordered a couple of nexus sevens for use in the company
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   We use a lot we do a lot of stuff. I'd be curious for some of your kids who are real iPad fanatics
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.160]   That's all if they can use it
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.720]   And I'm gonna let them play with it and see where they go with it
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.480]   My my son has gotten pretty pretty agile with both the tv and the
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.760]   He does things with the tv that I can't figure out how to undo
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.760]   He's what three? Yeah, he's five
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.800]   He's just like he's just like cranks. Oh, yeah, dad. You don't understand
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.360]   He's the worst part is like I've already gotten to the point where he goes give me the controller
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.360]   Oh
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:47.480]   That's their work but but the um so I think that he'd probably be fine
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:53.080]   But but I don't know if I'm still not convinced that the android is that my daughter when she was two years old was
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.920]   Very comfortably finding her apps, you know what she wanted on an iPad
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.440]   I'm not totally clear that that would happen with an android. I'm still not sold on that
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.760]   Um, I'm also not sold that so so I think simplicity is an important piece and I think their own market
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.880]   So like I'm locked in in a lot of ways like it'd be very hard for me to replace everything I have on my ipads
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.880]   On on it on an exes
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.720]   I agree if you're a DJ you need it
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.200]   I know what I mean. Well, what are the apps that you have to have but that are not specialty apps
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.960]   Well, I mean, they're all free and available in the android. Okay. I'll have to I'll have to look at that
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.720]   I mean, I just gotta have my own eye too. Oh, yeah, I choose is not available in the back of my head
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:37.160]   What I have is I've got probably 90 music has all your music and has radio, but okay, I'm
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.520]   But I have 90 why you spotify so I don't really think about buying music but 799 google music
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:48.920]   By the way, I can Chromecast it. I've been playing on my stereo since the Chromecast came out. That is mind-boggling. That is awesome
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.080]   Yeah rock and roll
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.080]   Yeah, and the um
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:59.240]   But the well and and like this gets this is why it's so important to play the you know to do these things is because for instance for spotify
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.920]   I don't look at the cost of it. I look at the fact that I spent a lot of time building those playlists
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.240]   And I don't really want to do it again, you know and and the
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.080]   There is investment ecosystem right now is the key it is key
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.720]   And that's the thing that apple did right early on is that I mean I've got 90 to 100 movies on on iTunes
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:20.360]   I have 450 or 500 apps. I have you know, you know, it's like, you know, that you know a lot of which I purchased and I'm not that excited about
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.840]   Reinvesting that you know, you know and and or trying to find it or whatever
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.520]   So I do use android. I mean I haven't I have an android phone. I have an exes
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.840]   Or I just ordered an exes. So I use the stuff
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.480]   But I don't use them in the same way that I use my iOS app
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.600]   Right, you know, I think that that's the thing that I notice and but I think that the simplicity
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.320]   But I also think that people returning so what apple has to make something good enough so a lot of us go
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.040]   Oh, we're gonna get the next phone, you know, like we're gonna upgrade
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.680]   To the next one or we're gonna upgrade to the next iPad
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:52.360]   Like the last iPad for I didn't upgrade. I do my I was just like you do market research all the time on this and I you know
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.400]   I guess you'd have got my teeth cleaned
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.320]   So the dental
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:04.040]   Technicians asking me she says that my phone is up. So I said, uh, I said there's something really exciting new phones are coming
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.640]   I'm thinking iPhone 5c or whatever they're calling it and the
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.200]   Moto X the note 3
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:17.000]   I said, what do you have? She says an iPhone 4. She says and I'm due for my upgrade and my fiance is also he's android
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.760]   She said which is interesting
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.480]   uh, and he's looking and um
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:27.080]   And it very willing to change and I think this is something that should scare apple a little bit
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.600]   For a long time people were like jeff needles over here said take my
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.080]   You can have my iPhone when you could pry it from my cold dead fingers. You still say that jeff
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.480]   Yeah, although you didn't you ask me didn't you say if you're not going to use it htc one? I'll take it
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.040]   Yeah, what's that about blackberry?
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.400]   But I do think that in the general populace
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:51.960]   Where where was that way it's starting to shift and my biggest question is is google getting in the hardware business?
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.920]   I think they have to that's a very odd thing exactly getting in the services business
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.880]   It seems to be microsoft's getting into hardware. Well, but it seems to be a shifting
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.360]   I think the integrated solution is not very successfully
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.360]   Having an integrated solution is really important because it's no longer about
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.840]   Microsoft has proven in a lot of ways
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.560]   You know what was wrong with building only software and letting everybody build hardware and and and android
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.720]   I think something is going to continue to become
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.040]   More proof of that um, which is that you get fragmented hardware
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.680]   I mean google has this issue now when they run an update of how many people are actually updating app when apple runs an update
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.080]   Everybody updates, you know, and so so the
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.520]   uh
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:36.200]   So I think that that google has to take more and more control over the over the hardware so that they can create the
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.240]   That seamless experience between the hardware and software that I don't think you can get when you have phone companies
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.000]   You know crippling half your software and not upgrading and you know all of the things
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.640]   Notice by the way google moving more towards these google edition now. They have three google edition phones
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.480]   and uh wait for the wait for the google now google plus fawn leo
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.080]   I mean, I really think that I think google is god. I wish I could talk to you about this stuff
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.160]   But I can't so we're gonna take a break
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.880]   We'll talk next week
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.440]   Um, i'm not under nda. I can say anything you can say anything
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.880]   And I think that's a hell of a player, right?
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.480]   That's a hell of a fight wouldn't it be wouldn't that be interesting wouldn't that be very interesting?
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   Way better than a facebook home phone
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.200]   You know, isn't that funny how we all thought home might be a big thing and it turned out to be not the leastest
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.520]   tiniest little I never thought it was a big thing. I just had to be annoying
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.080]   It was the wrong metaphor for a home screen lock screen
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.240]   You know, we debated whether to cover it we decided not to cover it and everybody was mad and I saying, wait
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:34.040]   Are you again? This is a huge release. This is very very important turned out. It was just a crappy app. Yeah
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.480]   Brilliant team wrong wrong thing
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   I think I think it was a lot a lot of great ideas
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.720]   But I don't think facebook is a service that can actually have the sort of influence on its users anymore
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:49.000]   They realize that they are they are the dry cleaner that that is that's doing great great business
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.520]   But they are tricking themselves into thinking that they are number one because they are great businessmen when in fact
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:00.280]   It's because that they are the dry cleaners that's on the way to work and on the way from work for most of the people in their area
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.400]   And if that if if route one a word we shut down for for for maintenance
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.520]   And they people went to a different route then people just would not even remember that facebook even existed
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:17.560]   They are no there are no fans of facebook they're people who are fans of being connected to the people who use facebook and once those people move to something better
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:22.040]   It's migratory all those fake farms are going to go
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:28.600]   Oh, I don't know if there's anything I don't know if there's anything that replaces it because it's a very different ecosystem
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.800]   You know, we we do a lot we do a lot with google plus and and so we're very wedded in that that process and
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   I don't see but google plus is very different
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.760]   It's very different because google was really about what you're doing and the things that you're interested in and facebook is about you
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.720]   You know and and your friends, you know, and and I think that that's
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.040]   But I know that I
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.640]   You definitely break things out differently the two social networks
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.960]   We're gonna take a break when we come back uh mike mansfield
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:59.320]   On sunday, we're doing the bob man's field not mike man's mike man's field is the lake great senator from
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:03.720]   Bob man's field and the other man's field
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.160]   Uh, we're doing twitter on sunday and all of a sudden people in the charmer saying mansfield's no longer in the executive team
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   What he's not on the website. I said well, why don't know he's still on the canadian website
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.360]   Well, I don't know so we didn't know what was going on. I think we have a better idea now
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   We'll talk about that and what if the 10s
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.120]   Uh, but first a word from shelterstock.com
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:28.920]   Uh, it is so neat, you know, I have to say I didn't really um, I don't use
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.320]   Broly free photos that often or I didn't you should I and yeah, suddenly I'm becoming a fan
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.840]   Uh, I got a shelter stock 25 image a day account for this for all of us
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:46.760]   You know for the network because I can't use 25 images, but we're starting to use more and more shelterstock images videos vector
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.600]   graphics
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:54.120]   Illustrations and I'm suddenly realizing it makes everything prettier and better and nicer and one of the interesting more compelling
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.200]   I use a lot of um stock photography and stock. Do you what do you use it for?
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:06.360]   Everything I mean anything is so oh, I need a map of the us or oh, I need a map of the world or roanda or or I need a flag
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.240]   Or I need a you know like look up like roblundin flag or you know, so I need a map for something for some kind of presentation
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:16.120]   See how we just do google image searches steal it right but but the thing is is that when you steal it
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.520]   It's not just it's not good karma
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.480]   It's also that it's not going to be the same quality right and it's not going to be completely done and and so
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.440]   So look at this. This is a one to map the roanda flag and you know, you get all these flags
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.480]   Like it's smart about it and if you look at these and you'll go in and see that that some of them are a whole bunch of flags together
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.600]   Right rather than one and you can buy one. Oh, you could buy. Yeah, look at that
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.080]   You know, so look at that the point is is that and and the math you have to do a lot of times is
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:46.040]   Especially when you're building something that you know that you want to be high quality whether it's a presentation whether it's an ad
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.200]   You want you want to know that you're legally everything sewed up if you're really doing business
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.600]   but the second thing is is that
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.800]   You know, it's going to be higher quality and when you think about the time it would take to create it or to really go out there
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.520]   And find it or whatever and find just the right image
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.240]   It's just it's just much faster just to buy something, you know, and so I probably spend
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.680]   We probably spend a couple hundred dollars a month on on on stock. This is so awesome. So here's a deal
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.320]   You can sign up for free by the way. You don't even need a credit card
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.880]   You'll get free images every week
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.760]   A free photo of free vector image
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.040]   You will also be able to use light boxes, which is really great
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.440]   And this is not you don't have to buy anything to use light boxes
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.800]   You don't even have to give them a credit card. The idea is once you've signed up
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.200]   You can say oh, I like this image add it to a light box and and I'm going to say kitties
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:37.160]   This is going to be my kitty cat light box. These can be used for inspiration. Maybe you're working on an article
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.280]   For me the inspiration is part of the coolness
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.960]   Right because uh, these light boxes not can be shared with others
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.440]   Um, you so here's the deal you can buy images individually you can buy packages
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.200]   You can buy subscriptions no matter what get it get a free account
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.320]   So you can play with it the amazing search engine, which includes by the way
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:02.840]   Uh, something uh, see there's my light box. I'm like kitty cat light box at the bottom there. Um, the uh, the, um, uh, uh,
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.400]   Uh, includes the color wheel
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.720]   What do they call it? They have a name for it, which means that you can narrow it down by, uh, color
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.880]   Um, let's see it said so which is really good for designers
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:20.280]   Uh for finding new ideas the ipad app is spectacular highly recommended
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.680]   Look a pig
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.760]   Look a bird. I don't know what i'm looking at right now. Here's kissing fishes
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.360]   I definitely want to put that in my light box. That'll go in the fish light box
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:35.640]   So, um, but you can you know, you can do like like the ones that kind of stuff we do is like we're doing a presentation

[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.240]   Let me close my light box here. By the way, everything i'm doing you can do for free. I just want to point out
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.120]   So you got all these little these are neat, you know that so you could use these, uh,

[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:32.040]   These poor women have spent too much time in the sun. They've got what is what is
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:38.680]   I don't know what that means. They've got happy faces burned into their backs. This is just very strange
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.400]   Oh, here's a couple in the surf. This would be good for your wedding photography

[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:52.120]   Shutter stock calm user offer code mac break seven so bob man's field
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:59.480]   At first, you know the natural reaction of because apple apples, you know the secrecy can go a little too far
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.520]   They just pull his picture off the executive page, right?
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.800]   That's not the way you want to announce something like this. Yes, exactly
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.640]   So naturally speculation or isn't it man's feels gone. So here's what or is it?
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.960]   Maybe that's yeah, we were all talking about bob tried to retire a couple of years ago
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.400]   Um, and it you know, we don't know there's a lot of speculation
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.720]   There was certainly a lot of evidence that he did not like scott forestall apparently they
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.440]   You know couldn't be in the same room together
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.960]   Forestall would come in and present then leave then bob would come in and present bob was in charge of manufacturing
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.400]   Also weirdly oh because forestall had chips yet a lot of the young out of the hardware for ios under him too
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.520]   And you know that's more of man's fields purview. So it was kind of an odd
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   Uh divisional relation you heard those rumors too though, right? Yeah, absolutely
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:47.560]   Yeah, and i mean i don't know if it's true again. This is you know, it's hard to know what's going on inside
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.160]   um
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.600]   then uh
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.240]   Weird scott says i'm retiring and bob says i'm retiring
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.600]   Two months later forestall leaves man's feels back
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:02.920]   Right and the speculate in fact back with a very large compensation package 85 and a half million dollars
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.480]   And then you tie it on to work
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:11.720]   Now it's mostly stock, but right hey i'd take 85 and a half million and apple stock who wouldn't yeah, that's in one year
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:17.960]   Uh and apple and tim cook announced bob's agreed to stay with us through 2014 next year two years by a lot of tesla's with that
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.960]   That's all i'm saying
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.240]   So
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.560]   The the reasonable conclusion was for
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:29.800]   Mansfield says tim here's my resignation. I want to retire enjoy the grandkids. Tim says just can you give me two months
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.560]   Something's going to happen something wonderful
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.480]   [Laughter]
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.320]   Forest all out
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.640]   They say here's 85 and a half million dollars
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.280]   Can you stick around for two years?
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.440]   Right. Hey the grandkids are not going to be you know, right out of the house. Okay, two years
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:52.920]   Um, and so what do they put him in charge of they put him in charge? What was his uh new technology senior vice president technologies
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:58.520]   What does that mean? I don't even know it was like the antenna as the chip sets all the not not the hardware the actual device level
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.040]   But everything that goes inside the device that makes it run like the engine instead of the body
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.160]   Now the the spec. So he's off the executive team
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.040]   And now working on special projects
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:14.280]   Sfer this you're the iWatch guy, uh rene. What do you hear your ears to the ground? What does this mean?
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:20.520]   My understanding and it's only partially informed is that Mansfield was going to leave tim cook and him did how well
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.480]   At some point a decision was made that he was going to stay
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:28.760]   The transition to dan richio who was taking over for him in his old position wasn't going as smoothly as they hoped
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.400]   And tim cook wanted to really remake apple and sort of like the way steve jobs did where he did
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:40.600]   You know portable desktop consumer business. He wanted to have that same grid where they had technology design software hardware
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.080]   And mansfield fit very neatly in that so he agreed to come back and he agreed to have this position
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.960]   But it wasn't a long-term thing it was a transitional thing
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.080]   And now he's going back to what he originally came back to apple to do
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:56.920]   Which was just to do special projects with no executive overhead doesn't have to worry about any of that he can focus on
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:03.080]   Uh, the whatever the next big thing is for apple and most of speculation around that now is the iWatch
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.080]   And frankly if you have someone of mansfield's talents
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:10.280]   You probably want to have him in their engineering yet and not really worrying about a lot of overhead to begin with
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.560]   john groover says
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.560]   everybody loves bob
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:20.040]   Every he's one of the most if not the most beloved
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:25.160]   Employees in kupertino and I think that's reasonable if you know, we know because they're publicly held company
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:30.840]   What his compensation was he was one of the highest compensate executives not just not just an apple but in the world, right?
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.480]   Um, so that's one way of showing love
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.320]   You know, right?
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:40.520]   Uh, so what agreed that everybody at least him cook and the board love no one can blame he got 85 million dollars
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.360]   And and they they walked to the average employee and he said yeah, that's he's worth it. So
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:50.120]   Uh, groover writes after asking around word on the kupertino street
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.880]   There's nothing punitive with mansfield's role change nor health problems or anything like that just a more focused role
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.160]   Uncertain new products
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.280]   He was never intended to be a senior vice president for very long that was transitional not permanent
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.600]   People were unhappy with as you said reach you
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:12.120]   Uh, the the ground troops apparently weren't happy with him. They said he's not quite ready to run hardware. So bob said
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.480]   All right, i'll be i'll be i'll stick around for do that but
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.120]   Kind of think bob's got you know, if he can write his own ticket, right?
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.160]   He's gonna say i want to work on the most important project apple scott
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.400]   What is what is gonna change the playing field? What is the most important thing now?
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.640]   We don't know it could be the new apple car
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:36.440]   It could be apple tv could be all of those things but i think it's smart the smart people are saying i watch
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.080]   right?
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:44.760]   The impression groover says after talking to a few more people the impression i'm left with is that man's field has been so successful
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.800]   And remains so popular he can write his own ticket and this is the ticket he's written
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:56.200]   But what is it muzzled tough muzzled tough congratulations bob. He's 85 and a half million dollars
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.000]   Make me a watch make me a watch
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.480]   This is this is why whenever they're these executive shakeups in this industry and other industries people don't
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:12.440]   People always go to the like soap opera answer instead of the it's possible that this person after making a hell
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:21.160]   A lot of money is is driven less by his position inside a company and more by what he wants to do with the 10 20 30 or 40 years
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.240]   Year she has left with the rest of his life
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:30.680]   And sometimes sometimes an executive will take an exit simply because they really want to work on nature conservancy instead of creating the
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:36.440]   Instead of driving google into the into the whatever whatever's above the super stratosphere
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.000]   Do i have to say tim cook feels like he's refocused apple a little away from the google lawsuits from the
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.520]   From the in fighting and said let's focus on what we're what we're good at what we're doing
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:51.160]   He's not quite as vindictive his jobs was he's operational he's operational. This is the all this is I mean the problem is
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:57.320]   The only thing that apple has said steve dalling who's a spokesperson for apples told all things d
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:03.080]   Uh, bob is no longer going to be on apple's executive team, but we'll work at apple working on special products
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.880]   Reporting to tim which means he he gets to do whatever he wants he doesn't have to go to all those meetings
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.320]   Oh, I love that he still has no bill. I'll make you a deal
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.200]   Okay, I got the 85
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:19.160]   But i'd like not to go to meetings anymore. It's like well. You can't really be on the executive team if you don't go to the meetings
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.160]   That's okay
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.120]   I just don't want to go to meetings. I got universes to dent
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:29.160]   I got you. Yeah, and boy if you if you did if you could rate your own ticket, I think the I watch
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.240]   I'm still not convinced
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.640]   But I would guess that apple's betting the farm on it. Yeah, maybe not maybe it's a hobby
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.840]   It's the next I mean like the iPhone was that project everyone at apple
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.360]   It was that it was super heroes at apple and there hasn't been that for a while
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.200]   And this is probably like almost everyone's gonna want to work on the next, you know big thing
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.640]   Uh, they gotta be that's probably not apple tv
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.960]   I wouldn't it be crazy if if we all we talk about is watches then apple comes out with just a competitor to glass
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:43:00.120]   You know they have the patents I think wearable is very exciting and I don't think it really matters
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:07.080]   I don't think the issue so much is where you wear it as as how it integrates with your stuff
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.000]   How you know how you make a compelling case that consumers need to buy it the same way they did with the iPad
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.760]   You know how they have to prove that case and make that presentation. I also think
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:18.040]   that
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:23.640]   The the issue of wearable is going to be right now
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:30.040]   It's been handled that the device whatever it is glass or watch is in the satellite to a more powerful processor
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:35.560]   And I am a more and more of the opinion that really the transformation that's happening is not that there is a central
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.640]   Hub and spoke model, but that we have smart things everywhere
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.680]   Mashed together as roughly equals that it's peer-to-peer not client server
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:50.120]   So if apple's gonna make a watch that really is gonna make a difference. It's got to be more than just a pebble
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.280]   Oh, yeah, look at there and they wouldn't do just a pebble right pebble's been done
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:58.120]   If you look at the original iCloud presentation leo and steve jobs came up on stage
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:02.040]   It was very careful to say that there's not one single store of truth on you know on top
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:08.760]   You have all your devices and they push down and they store up and he even demoted the Mac to be a device right the same as the iPhone
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:15.800]   But I mean if you look you look at Mansfield and he's been making working with apple to make the swift
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.560]   Processors and you know all the different technology that the antennas that go into
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:24.280]   iPhones if there's a guy you want on wearables. It's hard to think of a guy you'd rather have on wearables
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.360]   Yeah, what is what is this skill set Bob skill set? What does he do?
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:33.800]   What makes him so lovable is he does he giggling when you poke him?
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.440]   I bet she tells good good stories
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:41.480]   He makes an incredibly successful line of mobile devices work incredibly well
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.640]   So the you could credit him with a phone in the pad a lot. I mean the internals for sure
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:51.960]   He's he was like the internal technology guy for you know several years working on the iPhone and iPad line
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.080]   Mike and Newark says Bob's getting a gold watch the best kind
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.560]   not for retirement
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:04.040]   Um making his own watch and he but he is an specialist in uh manufacturer
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:08.760]   That's what I got the feeling but maybe that's just because he has how he looks
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.160]   He looks like he's a guy. He's gonna be on the factory floor
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.040]   Right maybe not. I mean that's just me
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:19.480]   I'm guessing that he has enough technical understanding to talk a good game and he has enough people understanding to
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.760]   Encourage people and that's probably that's usually hard to find
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:30.040]   If you look at the videos johnny, I would would explain what it looks like and how it's supposed to be used in mass field explain why why all that works
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.480]   Right. That's right. That was the the differing roles they took
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.840]   Those videos are the roadmap of the new apple
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   Exactly and it's a pretty good roadmap
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.960]   I mean when you think about the actual you know for the kind of they have a great team there and the question is is what they
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.080]   You know what comes out the other end, but they have all the right pieces
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.760]   I'm still skeptical. I want I mean I want the I watch to be
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.040]   Awesome. I just don't know what it could do that would make it awesome
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   Just watch that
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:01.800]   I do think that interaction with the real world is going to be the the the subtext pretty much everything
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.440]   One thing that occurred to me about the chrome cast is that it does what it does exceptionally well
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:12.680]   But if you think about it at that price point, maybe a lot of people are going to have them in on every tv that they have inside the house
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.920]   Now
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.480]   I accidentally bought three because I did not because
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.560]   It's because so there's
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:29.960]   All I'm saying is that it's nice when a company tells you in advance that oh by the way, we will of course be sending you one
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.960]   You'll have it first thing in the morning
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:37.240]   Because because then you I went to google play and I went to amazon and they didn't even have it listed
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:41.160]   So then I went to google play and they had them but I could see that oh, it's really gonna sell
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.520]   Quickly if I really want to have one to review and they will they I can have it friday morning with next to okay final buy it
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:50.520]   Then it went back to amazon then amazon finally had it so I bought one there
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.400]   Hopefully that could cancel the first one and that's when google said oh by the way, you'll get one first thing
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.720]   You sign for the package. We'll have it 8 a.m. On thursday. Okay. Thank you. No, no good place
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.320]   I have it up but three TVs in my house. Yeah, it's one but i'm sorry
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.200]   What i'm getting at is that so it'll do that job really really well, but now you
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.400]   Given that it's a it's a it's a chrome pc
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.200]   It's not just a dumb receiver of whatever
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:20.920]   It would be not terribly difficult for these devices now to with a companion app running on your phone to be able to tell that
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.960]   Not only are you home, but you are inside your living room right now
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:28.440]   Oh, now you're inside your bedroom right now just by measuring the proximity of a phone to that device
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.520]   And the things that it that that all of your services can do
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:38.040]   If they know what the context of being inside the kitchen is what the context of being inside your home offices
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:44.600]   That's when you start to get people more interested in handing over personal information to a company like apple or company like google
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:51.320]   If they could actually project exactly the piece of information you want and the exact context you needed in at the exact time or place
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.800]   What occurs to you that gee would be nice to have this information
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.880]   That is the next magical thing that that computers can do
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.520]   You know, it's it's nice to have the tablet that can do whatever
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.120]   It's nice to have the phone that can do whatever
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:07.320]   But the next step is the computer knows that you're going to need this and puts the right to put you know
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.080]   Puts the tool in your hand as soon as you reach out your hand before you ask for anything
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:18.280]   That's the term for that is geofencing, which is not really the best term, but it is it is the term or beacons apples new ibacons
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.520]   Yeah, but but I have to point out that google did update the geofencing in four three
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.360]   They're very aware of this idea
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.840]   Square uses geofencing when you walk into a store
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:32.200]   And pay with square pops up says you're taking care of there's a great feeling to that
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.360]   The watch you never take off you might take the phone out of your pocket you might take the laptop out
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:40.360]   But you're always wearing and somebody said in the chairman. I think this is probably good. Let's not call it a watch
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.320]   That's really not that's a misnomer. Let's call it the eye band
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.040]   Because really way the iPhone right? Yeah, it's not about the time watch focuses on what time is it?
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.520]   It's not that it is the thing you always wear
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:55.000]   Who knows where you are and when i'm when i'm using a way to let consumers understand what it is though
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.960]   Like using by calling it an iPhone when the phone is just icon on the screen
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.440]   But it but it has but it limits our thinking as to what it could be when i'm really curious with also
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.640]   I don't think I don't think apple would create a product that doesn't do anything in and of itself
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:13.080]   So even if they so even if they just had to put like a cheap like two cent lcd on it that gives you the time of day
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.440]   They would they would definitely have a do something and they do a lot cooler than that
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.360]   But they would have to they would have to at least study the time
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.200]   Well, one of the things i'm really curious about is when you think about things like airplay
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:27.080]   Being able to have stuff on your watch that you can then you know then all your screens become something that
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.320]   Um are accessible, you know, so so you're not you're not really, you know, so you have a screen
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:36.200]   But you're not you know, you have something that can tie into those, you know, tie into those screens
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:41.000]   That's what we were talking about last time at Alex with ios in the car is basically bidirectional airplay
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.160]   So no longer is just a projection, but it's actually the interface gets put on a different screen
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.000]   You can start thinking about ios anywhere not just ios in the car right?
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.480]   Curox says we should call it the iShackle
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:58.200]   I cuff that might then from apple's point of view that might really be more of what they're looking for
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.320]   The interesting thing to me is we spent so many years trying to get just the basic handsets up to a point where they were functional
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.480]   We spent years investing and making the platform great and building things to make the platform good
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.960]   And now the platform is finally so good that the platform is being used to lift everything else up
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.480]   And you know
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.520]   They took apple a long time to get the ios hardware to the point where they can make ios 7 and now once that's done
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.800]   They can start
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.280]   Evolving their software and that will let them do all these different
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:27.640]   You know things like ios in the car and things going forward which then increases the entire scope of the mobile devices
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:33.480]   We have everywhere it's like an exciting time period willing into and i do think that you get impatient when i guess as soon as you install one
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:37.880]   Hue light you immediately or avoid that you can't control every light in your house
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:41.400]   You know i'm talking about this before the show you've got how many hues do you have now?
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.040]   Okay, and i've got nine and
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.680]   That has eight i thought three on me right now
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:52.600]   And uh and so we've all fallen in love with these and just for people who don't know these are led lights created by phillips that you control via
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:57.000]   Wi-Fi right on your uh hu app on your iphone just the idea that you can't control them
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.640]   You know it is just annoying and you want all your lights to be well you want everything there house i agree
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.240]   i'm like i want to warm up my nespresso so i want to go over and click on my watch and just go
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.720]   You know i do that with my nest i turn the thermostat up and down i want to be able to unlock the door
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.240]   Schlage and a number of make companies don't do that you gotta make sure everyone's involved
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:18.520]   And when i first got the nest my my my wife went crazy because the nest was only connected to my phone
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.960]   Every time i left it would go down to 55 degrees and then i come back and i would warm up
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.960]   You know and uh
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.240]   That's the nuclear weapon and historical wife versus
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:33.960]   He almost started that thing off and he said it was bad fighting over the remote
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:39.720]   And then well here's the worst part it went it was at the exact same time our our heater went bad
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.080]   Um
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:44.920]   And uh it was just have i happen stands it would turn out to be a bad filter or whatever
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.040]   But the problem was is she still blames the nest yeah
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.680]   No, she still blames the nest wasn't the nest broke the heater
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:54.920]   I have to think that's interesting is the device dependency now when my iPhone is in charge
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.880]   I can't change my lights, you know my google phone pass
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:02.280]   Is a lot less valuable if i leave my phone in the car and that's around to get it or run out of batteries
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:07.560]   So all these devices that are satellites are now utterly dependent on that one limited battery life device in your pocket
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:11.880]   I I I I I have to admit because of that i i've really thought about it
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.320]   I would really prefer an iPhone that was twice as thick that would last
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.360]   iPhone max three or four times longer. I mean you have max
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.480]   I would not bother because I have a battery on it almost the whole time anyway
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.760]   You know, I mean your mind is will just give me a nice thick one with a huge battery
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.040]   You know just a huge battery on the back and twice as thick and it'll be fine
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.760]   I mean 48 hours 48 hours. That would be amazing
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:36.920]   Well if you think about it then maybe this is why man's fields on the on the job the hardware challenges of an eye band are
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:43.240]   Significant easy battery life flexibility durability durability touch screen that you're gonna bang into all the time
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:47.640]   You're gonna put a fingerprint reader or other biometrics into it or what kind of health wonders you're gonna put into that
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.560]   This is a very sophisticated this is probably the most sophisticated thing apple's ever made
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:55.240]   Yeah, I have a friend who I won't name but they're a health care professional
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.920]   And you know, they can't pull their phone out of the pocket to glance a text message even if they're urgent
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   But when they have a pebble now and they can just quickly glance at it while they're with a patient
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.080]   And it doesn't look rude doesn't look like they're checking their phone
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:09.240]   But they if there is an emergency they're aware now of what's going on around them and it makes a huge difference
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.080]   Just to project notifications from your pocket onto your wrist
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.320]   I really want uh
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:20.920]   This all to be wet wear it's it's really she just all be and this is one of the things that glass actually does very smart
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:25.000]   They have that bone conduct and speaker you hear it and it's surprisingly clear
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.720]   But not nobody can hear it right and I just think if please drill a hole in my skull. I don't care
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.280]   I'm ready. I'm ready. I won't be the first
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.920]   Scott boy
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.920]   In seattle was scotted he was like
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.080]   He he had applied somewhere actually for someone to put like a 232 like an artist
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.480]   To in his head and I was like you might want to wait until that yeah, that seems a little
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:50.520]   Premature but he was but scot was thinking that far out. I want a serial cord. Whatever
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:56.280]   It's good. You didn't get it. I want a serial port. I have usb 2 in my head. No, that's you're out of date now
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.520]   three
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:02.280]   I'm waiting for no underbolt. You don't you don't want to know where the scuzzy terminator goes
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:10.440]   Yeah, so really that's I mean, but truthfully, that's the end point, right? That's where we're headed and it's not in our lifetime
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:15.080]   But that's where we're headed. I know you're younger than me, but I think it's not my lifetime
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:21.400]   I'm sure but but I do think that that's where we want to do what we want to do is we ultimately want to internalize
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.760]   The intelligence we want to we want an internet connected brain
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.720]   I think connected to all of our internet connected devices
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.800]   Well, I think that I think that we we slowly want to keep on adding what we do in reality reality
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.080]   reality and then we're gonna just start creating virtual reality that looks like just like the reality
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.240]   Well, that's what happened. We're in that already that happened. I think you remember
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:44.440]   I think it's just the opposite. I think the ultimate goal is to
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.200]   cause the cause our technology to retreat
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:56.040]   So far back that now we are not a people a nation of people who are looking at something on a watch or looking or taking out a
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:02.520]   Phone in a pocket or anything like that that there's just a little tiny little like only like almost almost like an actual pebble
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:07.720]   Inside your pocket that just simply does a little bit of a pulse and say that oh by the way
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.600]   There was something going on you told me you want me you wanted to be informed about
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:15.080]   This is the point at which if you want to distract yourself away from what you're writing or what you're doing
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.400]   This is where this is the time of which you want to look at that electronic
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:21.720]   Voices in my head and I want to be able to talk to them back, but maybe not out loud
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.400]   But that's what you want, right? Right?
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.240]   I want to say Leo your mom called
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:30.440]   Yeah, and because you're busy by the way, this is exactly that knowledge navigator video john scully made
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.080]   Right, uh leo your mom called and I knew you were busy doing Mac break weekly
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:40.840]   So I said mom leo loves you and he's gonna call you as soon as he can I can't
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.800]   And then I'll say thank you how
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:49.560]   No, no, that's why I know what you really is you walk up to someone and it goes and you hear little voices bob
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.720]   Yes
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.000]   Ask about joe joe. It's how's jarvis from ironman
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.520]   That's what we all want is that jarvis system from right blue and sharp
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:05.800]   After you after wearing a glass for about a month. It really occurred to me that if someone made a really decent bone conductive
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:12.680]   A bluetooth headset where something like what you're wearing right now leo where no, it's very it's really difficult for someone to tell
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.160]   You're wearing an earpiece, but I don't want something to go inside my ear
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:21.240]   I just want it'll just it can hang off of my ear be hidden by the back of it so that I can walk I can talk
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.480]   Nobody knows i'm wearing this also
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:29.400]   My actual ear canal is open so that I can be walking through the taking this wonderful nature walk and be hearing the birds
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.720]   Without anything impeding that and just simply has the ability to again
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.680]   Put a little bug in my ear and say oh by the way
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:41.400]   You wanted to know that the that the that the darth vader ceramic mug
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:47.320]   That's auction Ebay is about to expire so I want you want me to tell you that and also a mackephone where you could simply say
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.000]   uh, you know
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.240]   Where where is the memorial to george robert shaw inside this park
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:58.920]   And from the context it will tell you that it can tell you where you are and we'll simply say that it is
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   Download you know, you know, happened to the right
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.240]   Without having one of your eyes are throat like a throat mic
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:07.720]   I mean, I've ever used the throat mic, but but with uh like I've seen world war two movies
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.800]   Okay
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:13.720]   But you know if you had one so if you had a mic here and a bone conductor there
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:18.600]   This is the um, this is the esteem hearing it. I haven't used this but I've heard many people talk about this
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:22.840]   This is a implant that goes in under your it's a subdermal
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:26.040]   and uh
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:33.000]   The sound goes in the ear and the subdermal implant is actually interacting via wires with your cochlea
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.440]   They can't nobody can see it
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.800]   Uh, it's just taking information
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.440]   Uh from your eardrum and uh and helping you process it
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:51.240]   Cybernetics. Yeah now that exists. That's being for people
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.560]   For people with hearing difficulties certain kinds of hearing difficulties. Not all i'm not sure
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.880]   I'm just not sure that anybody would
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:05.800]   I think that we're two generations away from anybody being well welcoming that as a consumer product as a voluntary device
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:10.120]   I'm sorry not to suggest that that a hearing uh hearing assistive advice isn't voluntary
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:14.920]   But but you but you know what I mean where uh that my ears are functioning perfectly fine
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:18.680]   I want to have surgery to have something that tinkers with that
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:22.040]   Because I want my gadget to be able to talk to me
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.160]   I think you're gonna need to jennifer already already
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:33.240]   I'll already we're seeing the first the first disasters of uh the the black hat con people are going to be showing off
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:37.480]   Ways of go. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, the control systems inside cars
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:44.120]   And essentially cars in the steering wheel that jerk to the left or a slam on the brakes or turn off the brakes entirely remotely
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:46.920]   I'll leave a lot of people are going to have to become really
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:52.360]   Much to have a different relationship with the technology before they'll trust something that's implanted even more at the point
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:57.720]   uh, there was going to be a presentation in the black hat hacking pacemakers, yeah
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.440]   uh, but
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.480]   You know remember in the early days one of the reasons we have security flaws in
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.880]   Desktops and we don't have it so much in mobile is because desktops were designed before these were real threats
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:11.480]   Right and the mobiles they knew about it and so it's they're much more secure
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:16.600]   And I think the medical implant devices, uh, they're going to be aware of it. It's not so hard to make it
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:20.840]   But it's also I don't know all this this this may be this may be a rat hole
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.840]   But it's it's been on my mind that
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.560]   as annoyed as I am about the idea of
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:30.840]   Law enforcement is can is has been routinely saying that well continuing
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:35.400]   We're tracking people we're tracking someone because of their of the location from a phone
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:40.040]   We believe this is no different than having someone on the ground observing this person so that we don't need a warrant
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:44.680]   But at least I have the ability to leave this phone at home or pull out the battery because this is a thing with a
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.840]   Replicable battery if they simply say that well, you know what because there's a diagnostic mode on this pacemaker that allows
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.440]   A doctor within four feet with the right device to sense its proximity
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:59.480]   We're gonna essentially put that technology in our surveillance devices and now of course just you know
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:07.560]   It's just it's perfectly okay for us to simply say that because we were able to detect the presence of this person's pacemaker implanted inside their body
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.600]   Of device they don't have the they really don't have the option of taking it out or turning it off or shielding it
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.520]   And it's hurting that they don't need to warrant for that sort of stuff this these are the sort of things are going to keep coming up and coming up and coming up
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.760]   So i'm not i'm not sure that i and what happens when you get that and sort of implant and
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.200]   Once again someone just another a future court decides that
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:32.040]   A police officer does not need to have a warrant to get access to the audio feed that's coming in through your ears
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.640]   You know, it's it seemed ridiculous 20 years ago that
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.240]   That cop would have the ability to simply have that led to
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.360]   GPS track anybody without without asserting a warrant for for the need for that information
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.240]   But now it's happening in certain jurisdictions and
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.240]   Man a lot of stuff is going to have to change a lot of stuff is going to have to be addressed before the good stuff can happen
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.640]   That's that's what annoys me so much about
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:02.040]   The how slowly technology can develop if we were able to build whatever we wanted to build beyond our wow the streams
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:09.400]   We could create that utopia, but there's always going to be some individual bad person good person good intention person or other agency
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:14.200]   That can screw it all up and make this impossible to adopt on a wide-scale basis
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.360]   On that note, we're gonna move on
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:31.320]   This word from the fbi well the one we just had this uh, kind of a run-in with this in rewanda
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.920]   Chris
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:38.680]   Marlar who who's moved there. He's moved there. Someone stole his his uh his ipad and an iphone
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.920]   and uh
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.440]   Uh, they forget they turned off the iphone forgot to turn off the ipad
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:51.800]   And so at two o'clock in the morning. He along with the security team, you know like that's where private security really helped
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.200]   So what it turned out it was what kind of it turned out once more on the security guards
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:01.000]   Anyway, so it was one of the guards. Okay. Yeah, we didn't know we didn't know but it was one of those things like they just given up on it
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.240]   But they he stole a couple of other things and so they there's a story on chris if you go chris marlar and g plus
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.880]   He wrote it up, but he got it all we're talking about this morning. So they they literally are in the middle of you know
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:13.000]   Some little township and you know outside of kagali
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.240]   uh with an ipad and
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:20.200]   And like they're following around like and they get right to where they get right to where um
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.800]   Uh
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.400]   The two dots are on top of each other and there's you got to get there's there's chris
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:30.520]   There's a there's a there's a there's a um rewanda sitting there with an ipad and there's 12 guys with billy clubs
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.640]   you know like like you know and um and uh
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.520]   And uh they um they hit the ring and you're
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.920]   And he hears the ring, you know like you're gonna go the ring in the house and something guy comes running out and boom
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.840]   You know suddenly there was chasing after him and and they got him. He didn't get hurt. It's where wanda
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.040]   It's not other countries and so he you know they they they arrested him
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.440]   um and um
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.120]   But they it was funny. It was like the guys call evident like chris said the guys calling he's like
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.880]   We got him, you know, he's like talking to us boss and he goes and he goes yes
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.880]   We use the um zungu tracking
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.800]   Because they had never like it took him like it took him a while
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.400]   He was he was explaining to me this morning
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.840]   He said it took a while to explain to them what was happening that that on his ipad
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:16.600]   It was I can see the other ipad. Yeah, you know, you know, and uh, but what it was but but now it's been it's been termed in roanda as
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.160]   Zungu tracking um zungu what is it?
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.840]   is uh
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.320]   It's a it's a uh, it's a term for uh white people in in swahili
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.440]   so
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.000]   It's honky tracking
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.400]   That's that's actually a pretty even
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:40.200]   That's a pretty even term. Oh, that's funny. Oh, that's funny. We got the the ofe trackers turned on
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.680]   Turn on
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.920]   Oh, that is funny. Please use the shine reflecting that they pick up on but
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.240]   You got the honky tracker. Yeah, I do okay turn it on
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.080]   Uh, wow
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:59.160]   Anyway, so the thing is is that somebody called me by the way in uh on the radio show and said uh my son's
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:04.760]   iPhone was stolen and should we uh, is there should we track it down? I said absolutely not
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.640]   What if the guy has a gun? What if you could track it down?
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.440]   And then I don't think the police if you go that's why private security force more effective
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.480]   If you went to the nypd and said hey, I know where my phone is when you go get it. Right. I think they might not
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:24.120]   What are you talking? I'm waking here. Um, so I don't know but uh
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.160]   Maybe the nsa would be the right people to call
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.400]   They already know they already know where your phone is
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.680]   Well, there's been people who have I think that have tracked it down and then
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.680]   You know being able to tell the police exactly who it is
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:39.800]   The funniest one is when people when you could control the computer and then you can take pictures of the people and well the cracker tracker
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.880]   Yeah, that was there's the name
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.960]   The cracker tracker. Thank you chat room
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:48.040]   I would prefer them to cracker. That's all I'm saying
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.160]   I like to run out and drink like that
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:57.000]   All right, we're gonna take a break when we come back we will talk about hacking uh and the
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.760]   Dev Center hack which has been resolved but the question remains lingering
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:06.760]   Right. What are the long-term impacts of all of this our show today brought to you and by the way, we got a great panel
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.400]   Thank you so much. Andy and aqua from the chicago sun times
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.920]   He's got his monitor over his left shoulder
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:20.840]   And rene richy from i'mor.com. He's got his monitor over his right shoulder. Hi, laks squirrel no squirrel
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.240]   What is on your monitor?
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.640]   I have ios 7's uh multitasking
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.760]   Where did you get a picture of that apple.com? Oh, okay, then it's all right
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:36.360]   That's legit. I like it. Did you do were you inspired by Andy or you just thought?
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:41.320]   I needed it for other things and I figured that Andy was using it so well. I would try to pay hold it to him
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.280]   Yeah, what kind of monitor are you using is it 30 27 like apple stores? I'm using a samsung
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:53.320]   Really? Yeah, use a samsung in the apple stores for the apple tv demos and for when they make those giant iphone monitors
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.840]   Oh, yeah, they have to use a big tv till they get the apple tv. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:02.840]   Also here from pixacore a second week in a row. I'm blown away. It's crazy. I love it. Alex lindsey
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.840]   I'll be gone next week. Where you going next week? I'll be in uh, boston. Bastin bastin. It'll be in you'll be where?
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.240]   Yes
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.720]   What city will you be in? I will be in boston
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:20.200]   We should talk uh that that well unfortunately i'm gonna be in wall fam and that's like 11 miles away
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.480]   Right
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:28.680]   That's not definitely though. Definitely. All right. All right. I mean I could drive but I mean that's like what can you take the mta to waltham water gallon quarter
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.640]   Gallon, so you should just you should just work on the project with us. You know, Andy
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:36.200]   We're looking we actually are looking like awesome. I enjoy projects. All right
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.880]   This one's fun
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.840]   Is it like did you buy like the big like huge like lego millennium falcon?
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.120]   You need people to help you put it together all I can say is at the end of it usually end up with something to eat
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:49.240]   I also like something to eat that my favorite style of cuisine is complimentary. Yes
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.400]   [laughs]
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:56.120]   Our show today brought to you by smile software. They do such great programs

[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:35.320]   Uh her idea being to get girls writing software, which is such a great idea
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.880]   um
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.160]   Let me see if I got it right here gene mcdonald app camp. That's what it was called
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.720]   app camp for girls.com
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:52.920]   And that makes me really happy. I was I was kind of okay with only 49 percent of the population at age 11 being able to out program me
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.320]   Now the other
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:00.040]   The more focused and mature 51 percent. Okay, great. I'm totally hoes. No, so cool
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:06.360]   Uh, they they say inspiring tomorrow's creative software developers here's some of the pictures of some of the girls at app camp
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.480]   I just think it's a really really neat idea
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:16.280]   Uh, and they're continuing to look for support so you can go help them out app camp the number four girls.com
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.960]   And what's that? That was from a Kickstarter. She yeah, she gets started it. Yeah, I got it. I got it. I got it
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.960]   Or any go go. Yeah. Yeah, that's right
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.520]   Um gene is just a really
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.920]   Wonderful person. She works. Of course. She's one of the partners at smile software. That's maybe think of it
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.640]   I just think that's so cool
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:37.640]   Every kid should go to app developer camp. That's a cool tool. Did you see that it was like a widget tool
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:45.480]   Uh, one of those here. Yeah, I'll let you make your iOS layouts. Look at that. That's cool. Isn't that a great idea?
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:50.600]   Great spending your spend your summer camp time making friendship apps instead of friendship bracelet
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.680]   Much better than gimp. Uh, this is from ui stencils
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.280]   Um, what a neat idea ui stencils.com
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:05.880]   They have iphone website ipad android android tablet android donut windows 8 windows phone google chrome stencil
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:11.400]   I'm just so afraid of paper now. I know this is very old. I'm gonna lose it. It's so old school
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.640]   But you know what I see what a good way to do it because that's not up to drop box
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:22.280]   Last last week. I added something to my work setup. That is a pad of note paper and a decent pen
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.080]   And the number of times we're not like instead of having to like wait for the spinning beach ball
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.240]   So I could write down something that someone is telling me
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.560]   During an interview is like, oh, I'm just actually jot that down. Oh
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.880]   I just think it's funny how often how often we uh, we suddenly need a pen to draw on something and no one has one
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.320]   Like everyone's like, I don't I don't have a pen that actually, you know, make like Andy
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.920]   I have the notebook, but I photograph every page that I work on because I'm paranoid about backups
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.000]   Yeah, oh, yeah, so these guys they're they're making these nice metal stencils
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.480]   And they said you know what else could we do with metal and they started a new company called looks plates
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.360]   Where they are?
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.080]   Look at this. I want this for my iphone
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.640]   Look at that
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.560]   It looks like a like a elf on the back of your iphone
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:13.080]   Cost 1-1-2 even inexpensive. It's 33 bucks and it's metal. It's nice
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:17.480]   Protect the back of your yeah for all those you who thought they really should have given you a uh,
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.600]   Metal backing you could have a dog tag so people could actually get your phone back to you without having to track them down using the
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.600]   That's a cracker tracker
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.320]   You know, it's a good tracker
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.840]   And engraving plate for let's say like a $10 bill. So if you ever like, you know
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.360]   You're caught without cash you just you know, you're running and yeah
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.440]   Well, they've kind of got that. This is for if you play a lot of poker you could sprint your own aces
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.520]   And you had enough phones you could play
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.960]   52 phones that
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.680]   Has to be no that's that's they should do the pen and teller edition is the three of clubs
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.320]   So that the end of every trick was this your card
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.840]   Um
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:01.240]   That's by the way that was right there. That's an example of why the internet is the biggest productivity
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   History of the world
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.440]   I got four links deep before I finally caught myself
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.640]   Uh, eeb-ebra ham balach
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:16.600]   Uh fella who uh was the first to publicize the uh app center hack
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.920]   um
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.120]   Baloch is an independent security researcher. He
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.640]   Told apple. There's a problem with your dev center
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:30.840]   And uh downloaded uh credentials for a hundred thousand people just to prove it
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.320]   Right apple got a little miffed
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:40.680]   But immediately there immediate responses to take the I remember we talked about this the iOS dev center down
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.840]   Right it came back after eight days apple said we had to rewrite everything redo our database everything
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.600]   Um
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.080]   He says look it was just a proof of concept. I immediately told apple
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:59.640]   Uh the real question and I have to say I saw some somebody showed me and I don't know whether it's real or not
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.960]   But we had a visitor here from a foreign land. Mm-hmm not balach
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:11.160]   But somebody I think who knew him who showed me logs that showed apple certificates dev dev certificates the root certificates
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:16.040]   Uh, and he says he got the root certificates or not. So whoever hacked he got the root certificates
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.360]   Now that would be a much more significant
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.240]   Flaw and we'll know if that happened because apple will have to send out new certificates
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:27.160]   And we'll have to refresh the entire app store. Oh man
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:34.520]   It's I mean it's it was really complicated and uh nik rnott our security writer interviewed him because it was such a nebulous story to begin with
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:40.040]   Right and it turns out that he didn't the original hat he filed a bunch of radars with apple and their bug tracker
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.800]   And some were for iadd workbench which is a different system
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.320]   And some of it was for the dev portal and apple took it down
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.800]   But we don't know if it's because of him because some of the stuff he filed was after apple took it down
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.280]   Uh, he got a bunch of addresses
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:00.200]   And you know the guardian went and looked at some of the addresses and they weren't valid or they didn't return anything
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:07.960]   So it's nebulous, but he did find ways into there which could suggest that you know either apple was alerted by him or apple found out that there were other people using
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.800]   Similar exploits, but it was serious enough that apple took the entire thing offline and kept it offline for a long time
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.760]   Electronic arts quarterly results came out last week and it reported shock
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.080]   That it made more money through apple's app store than through its own
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.480]   Our origin digital download service or any other retailer
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:33.720]   That in app purchases and app sales will were the most profitable part of their business
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:39.160]   For the first time ever they have racing games real racing three they have the sims free play
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:46.040]   But it may well be the game that's hooked me for the last eight months the simpsons tapped out. I swear I it's a bad addiction
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:51.880]   Uh, it had it launched in august of last year. So it's been almost exactly a year
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.400]   They had server problems. They took it down put it back up. That's when I joined
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.560]   It made more money in the last three months the three three months quarter entering june 30th and in any other quarter
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.280]   Real racing three generated
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.520]   45 million downloads about two million daily active users
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.760]   The sims free play the highest one of the highest grossing games on the ipad
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:18.600]   They made 90 million dollars on smartphones and tablets. They don't say how much from my os how much from android
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.520]   10 million lat in the month of june on simpsons tapped out
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.560]   50 million dollars total it makes more money for them than their 60 dollar console games
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:32.600]   This is huge and a real good example of the shift to mobile gaming
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.320]   Yeah, and one of the things that happens with all of these things just like whether it's
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:39.880]   People going from my space to facebook or or or from you know digital
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.840]   Projection on theaters or whatever once you reach that point where suddenly people go and we're making more money over here
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.160]   Then all that investment all the safe money starts going that direction, right?
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.440]   You know and and once that safe money is I just don't I don't see how consoles
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.600]   you know
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.720]   Continue 10 years from now just because I think I just don't think I think we're going to be expecting our phones to be able to do that
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.720]   Which are going to be almost as powerful at that point
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:08.760]   Also, I think the look of the the mechanism of purchase like you don't have to go somewhere and buy a 60 dollar physical
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.000]   I literally have zero interest in a console. Yeah
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.080]   You take you take the device that you already have in your pocket or in your bag
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.960]   You go to a website you download a free app
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:22.760]   And then just keeps finding ways to get your get 120 dollars for me instead of 60 dollars
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.280]   Well, that's the key
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.680]   You have the you have the what the hell why not sort of reaction that you don't have with a 60 dollar
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:32.760]   That's the key its freemium is really proven to be a very good model
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.520]   The game is free and they just charge you for upgrades and
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.160]   Importance and even a dollar two dollars three dollars. I mean all of those things are just easy
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.400]   I mean, you know, it's and I you know, yeah, that maybe that's a better better game on the console
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   But I can play this one while I'm standing in line right?
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:54.440]   You know, by the way is moving towards non-physical media as well both the Xbox one but a station for a really emphasized
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.840]   I still feel like you spent as much on Simpsons upfront as you spent on it in an app over over the history
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:03.000]   Oh hell, I've spent 300 dollars on this game. Right. It's not a 300 dollar game
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.440]   I would never I hate to even admit that is shameful right but I did it in bits and pieces and
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:14.280]   But see that the point is is that but the one thing that I'll say is that is that would you pay 300 dollars for any game?
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.000]   Never no, I
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.960]   Hear the here's the thing I spent humans maybe I spent 300 dollars on tempest a long time ago
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:27.320]   You know like the good but what I mean what I mean by that is family pinball it might have been it might have been in the three
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.440]   Oh, I easily dropped 300 dollars in quarters. Yes, right
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.040]   I'm battle zone
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.840]   Let's cigarette smoke at home
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:43.160]   But but I think that I think that what's interesting about that is that it it's not a it's much easier for us to spend money on
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.960]   Something that because we're using it the reason we're upgrading it is because we're actually enjoying that time
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:54.760]   You know rather than upfront spending $60 to see if we like it or not. I love it. Yeah, it's soothing. I play it every day
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.840]   probably
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.960]   Which is which is the worst admission how much money I've spent or how much time because I've probably spent half an hour a day
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.480]   On that thing over the last year right I could have written a novel right
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:10.680]   You know but if you're if you're writing a novel that would have been work and
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:15.000]   A kid years ago a kid was trying to explain guitar hero to me
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.880]   Uh and just came up with a line that was so brilliant
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:21.880]   And I've just reflected upon so many times in the past that you don't understand
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.160]   Yes, I could be spending this time learning to spend real good to play real guitar, but I'm not here
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.240]   I'm not I'm not investing this hour to learn anything. I learned things all the I'm
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.320]   I'm here to have fun and do things that are not productive that are just
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:40.920]   Lights flashing and sounds playing and my my hands doing cool things with a plastic controller
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:47.480]   And I think you almost could argue that I bought the Nexus 7 specifically to play the simpsis tapped out
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:52.200]   I have a so add that to the overall cost
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:56.280]   But I also think that when we think about games and music I mean to get back to the guitar
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.600]   um, you know a guitar hero is
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.960]   Is when what happens when we start just playing games that are the actual instrument?
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:08.600]   I mean when you look at some of the stuff that you know, well and that's what rock band did didn't they they added real instruments
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.840]   Or or that they that that is the instrument, you know, like what you're playing what you're learning how to play
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.120]   You know is is actually something that when you're not playing the game
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.720]   You could just go about on your iphone or on your ipad and just play that
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.840]   You know, maybe we're moving towards it. We're seeing go ahead
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.200]   We're seeing more of a game in the phrase than so many other things too like
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:32.920]   Like hc1 phone has that mode where it will just simply take the video and the pictures that you happen to have collected and produce
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.560]   its own super cut movie and when you
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:41.640]   One of the other things that I'm noticing with the google class is that I don't like shoot
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.680]   I've never I spent you know, you and I both went on the that
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.520]   Met geeks cruise around asia brought a really good camcoder
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:54.360]   I probably shot maybe 10 minutes of video because I just don't like walking around like this, you know shooting camera about
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.360]   Tourist in asia
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:04.440]   Okay, not gonna say what what defines a tourist if you're am I am I I was a tourist at monobra
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:09.320]   Cemetery on sunday because yes, I'm from around here, but never okay. Anyway, but right that's right
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:14.280]   But the ability to simply press a bus that's gee that's kind of an interesting scene of people and things moving around
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:18.040]   Click i've got now 10 seconds of video and then over the course of a month now
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.520]   I have like all kinds of things in my library of nice little video clips if they were to create a
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:29.160]   Gamify video editing that simply said here is what the here's here's what this game created for you
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:36.600]   And now it's your now your fun time is to make this better or to enhance the focus on a certain person or place or an individual
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:42.120]   That I mean it's the the real power computing isn't when people like allax have the tools to
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:48.440]   In one three thousand dollar computer to produce and and visualize and effect and stream
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:55.000]   Uh huge movies. It's when people who have no interest in video can now are now empowered to do that because it's fun
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   All the technical stuff has been cluttered out of the way and now you can simply look at this thing
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.600]   This app has given you and said wouldn't it be I really want to see more focus on mom
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:08.360]   And then because it knows who mom is you simply say have a slider for mom. Okay slider up on mom
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:11.800]   There you go. Now. There's more mom here. Yeah, that's that's that's that's all this
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:18.520]   Video needed a little the color was like the color was a little little cooler. I want to make that warmer and I also wanted more mommy
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.960]   more mommy
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.160]   That's what google plus is done. I think not to bring it back to google
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.840]   But google one of the reasons I use google plus more is because of the photo. This is sick
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.920]   So somebody took
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.680]   seven or eight pictures of me
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:36.120]   Walking the catwalk and google automatically turned it into an animated gif right with camera awesome
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:43.160]   Now admittedly, this is incredibly stupid, but the fact that it did it automatically and it kind of happened is kind of fun
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:49.000]   I mean apple got the guy who made the quake three tournament physics engine to build the basis of the new ios
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.240]   I mean, that's a full particle and physics engine and they did that for a reason and you know, I think we're gonna see more
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:58.280]   Uh because people say gamification they sit in a bad way. They take money for you. It should be a game of okay
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:02.280]   Yeah, they're creating delight and that's the tenant now of most mobile operating systems
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:05.960]   They want to delight their users by the way. I got a message for my cup of coffee this morning
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:08.760]   That I should focus more on apple
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.040]   During the show today. Can you show the cup of coffee?
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.760]   That was creepy. That was weird
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.520]   I was I don't know it says that you want you need to write a new peach pit book
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.480]   Oh, that's what it is. It's a peach
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:27.800]   I'm showing for those who are listening at home. I'm showing a picture. Nice. Steve jobs is not happy leo
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.320]   I've never been able to do you know, I really would love to do the foam art
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.520]   Oh, yeah, then some of those baristas do I don't even try it's impossible
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:39.160]   I mean have a great espresso machine, but but and so I just poured it in but it somehow came out as an apple
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:44.760]   And so maybe now I'm thinking I have a future in espresso. Yes, but I but I think what you're saying Andy
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:48.680]   And I think this is right is that life should be fun. It should be a joy. It should be full of
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:52.280]   serendipitous surprises and pleasures and
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:23:00.040]   And that's what an iPhone should do and that's what apple's always going for right? Right. Yeah, that's that in game back to what we're talking about earlier on
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.960]   the
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:07.720]   One of apple's challenges is that hands down they they are the kings of the user of user experience
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:14.520]   You know, you can you can argue about what features a certain phone has and what you can do with a certain operating system that you can't do with a certain other operating system
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:21.080]   But hands down iOS provides the most elegant and beautiful and rewarding user experience anywhere out there
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:27.240]   Unfortunately though, that's not something you can really communicate easily that's that's an experience and you can
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:32.680]   share pictures of a restaurant's food and you can write a review of a restaurant's food
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:41.880]   But a user is not going to understand it until they actually taste it similarly the advantages of the iOS platform aren't something that people are going to really understand until they actually try one for more than
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:45.480]   25 minutes inside an apple store. I'm talking about carrying around in their pocket
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:51.240]   So that's why you know when you when no kia comes up with you know with like this this this peer review
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:55.400]   You got the 10 20. Oh, yeah, that's one of the things that actually was it was also
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:00.840]   I was really impressed. That was one of the reasons why I was at monobra to take some final pictures with it
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.440]   And literally final at the graveyard. Yeah before before jumping off the tower
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.280]   And no
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:14.120]   And so there's this beautiful like high tower that gives you like beautiful panoramic views of the entire city
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.600]   From from up there and of course had that one thing
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:21.800]   I'm just taking pictures with this and this guy said oh, is that the new Nokia phone with that really huge sensor?
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.880]   I'm like, oh man
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:29.320]   The word is getting out about other phones. Yeah, but that's but yeah, they're not
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:35.480]   If I had up like an iPhone 5 that had the beta of iOS 7 people would not be saying
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:40.840]   Oh, is that the new iOS with the translucency in the multi-layered operating system like yes?
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.160]   Oh, I've heard so much. No, it's it's an experience that you're gonna have to it's not a buzz
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:51.720]   Right buzz marketing worthy sort of sort of thing. So that's apples gonna have to spend as much time of messaging as anything else
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.040]   There's this is one of Andy's images
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.840]   Uh the color in that the resolution the detail
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:02.680]   Um, just see that looks like that's a that's a SLR quality photo. That's amazing
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:08.440]   I'm I'm and this this too behind me is as one of the first photos I shot with it. It's like
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.680]   uh, I'm
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:15.240]   It's that's zoomed. That's a crop. That is simply zoomed inside the camera
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:20.520]   That's a digital zoom version of it and you wouldn't really know that it'd been as digital zoom had been applied
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.720]   Uh, and yeah, it really is remarkable
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:29.960]   It's it's it's one of those occasions in which I did delay my review for several days because the first draft was like
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.800]   Oh my god. I can't believe this camera is most awesome camera like this camera can't do
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:39.160]   Okay, that means Andy. We got to spend the next four days trying to break this
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:44.760]   We have to basically try to make this screw up and try to humiliate this camera and say no
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:51.480]   You aren't all that you are simply a phone camera and I will take horrible pictures with you. Just watch me
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.800]   Couldn't do it, huh?
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:58.680]   Couldn't do it. That's looking selfie. I've ever seen by the way. The lighting on that was gorgeous
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.280]   Yeah, yeah, and I and I've and I've said it's not the selfie by the way that's
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:05.880]   That's a squirrel
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.720]   You'll see it in my review which will land tomorrow. I finished I finally finished it yesterday
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:13.320]   I'm all excited. Okay. Grace will be up tomorrow morning that I realized oh no
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:18.360]   And now I have to like get photos out of my aperture library and do so uh damn it
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.720]   And so that's why it's gonna be delayed today, but that this picture is like
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:27.320]   It's almost like an all-in-one demonstration of why this camera this this camera phone is so good
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.400]   Because number one it could not have been captured in a connoctomy capture without the flash
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:36.040]   Uh that froze the motion and illuminated what was going to be a backlit sub subject
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.000]   Number two
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:44.920]   This is actually like one quarter the size of the full frame and it's angled like this because I was walking around with this camera in my hand
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.480]   I had a bag of sunflower seeds on the other hand the public garden and you know squirrel
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:52.120]   If you've noticed what a bag of sunflower seeds
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:57.880]   No, no, no, no is the the gate and attitude of a human who has like has seeds and food to give to squirrels
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.280]   So sometimes you'll see this but as soon as you see then the squirrel will like drop down but
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:05.640]   Just whipped around with a camera camera
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   Squose the squeeze the shutter bank
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:11.000]   Locked focus got that picture. So this is a
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:18.360]   One quarter the size of the full frame that's also been rotated this way and you would never know that anything weird had been done with that
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.880]   That's really what they're saying the promises of it. You know very rarely will you want all 41 megapixels, but you can crop it
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:27.640]   Yeah, because exactly it makes for space and this is and this is why i'm sorry
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:33.960]   Let's circle it back to to iphone. This is why I keep saying that I really don't want apple to make thinner anything
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.800]   You can do that because they decided to make a phone that was thicker in the middle there
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.720]   And if anybody has been complaining about the design of this you're stupid
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:45.800]   I mean the the the thinness of a phone is not is not a feature of it
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:51.880]   But the ability to take superlative photos because oh my god who can carry a phone that is this thick
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:58.200]   That's crazy talk a phone that's this although I got to point out no kid did take great pains to make that much lighter than the previous
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.200]   Lumiya 928. So
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.040]   Maybe they're saying maybe we can't make it thinner, but at least we can make it lighter. I mean
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:12.200]   Yeah, I mean they but but I think that's it's it's it's a problem when you want to make sure that style does not trump
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:19.560]   Function I agree and sometimes I think that happens although although again. This is this is another part of apples problems in messaging
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:26.680]   The iphone 5 camera is not to me not quite as impressive as like not quite as impressive as the camera that's in this lumiya
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:31.640]   But it's still you know the one the greatest cameras you can but it's it's clearly it's it's nump
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.120]   There's it's sort of like the I'm sorry that if if the lumiya is number one
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:43.960]   iPhone 5 is a close number two and number three is pretty far down beyond that and the reason why is not because they have a sensor that has
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:49.000]   41 megapixels or an L a lens there are a lens in a image sensor. That's this big
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.880]   It's because they have a custom digital signal processor. That is
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:55.800]   Incredibly good at what it does softness everything at this point
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:59.000]   And so it's not something that you have to show people photos of it
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.280]   But you don't have that. Oh, by the way, the iphone 6 has a 68 megapixel sensor. That's the size of a
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.040]   That's the size of one quarter of a dollar bill
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:12.280]   It's about it's about the size of the size of a frame of medium format film
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.040]   And it can if you if you aim at the right side of the side of the planet
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.920]   You'll get a beautiful crop down picture of exactly what you wanted
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:22.040]   You can't simply say hello digital signal processing is what makes it
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:28.680]   Murphy says now you have to write an automator script to import your skydrive photos into your ios photo stream
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.240]   exactly
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.880]   Probably do services services. I'm probably doable
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:39.240]   See anything else we want to talk about before we get to our tips of the week
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.160]   I'm just looking at the rundown the Chad Johnson prepared for us all the great stories
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.920]   um
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:49.880]   You did mention that the worker group that is alleging abuses at pegatron in china
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.880]   I'm sure we'll have you're more about that
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:59.640]   Apple worker this is the strangest story I ever heard of file apple workers file a lawsuit
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:04.600]   Saying they lost wages. This is the employees at apple stores in New York in Los angeles
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:11.080]   Because apple required them to stand in line for up to 30 minutes every shift to wait for a manager to search their bags
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:16.520]   Uh, they want 1,500 dollars a year in unpaid wages
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:23.720]   Um, they're searching for merchants, you know stolen merchandise shoplift merchandise. Sorry when I when I see these
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:28.360]   I'm just like I don't think that these employees are probably at the top of the
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.040]   Food chain it
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.800]   Well, I mean what I mean by that is they probably weren't the highest performers at apple and they're no longer working
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.320]   They're trying to figure out how to get a little extra money to yeah stretch things out a little bit further
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:42.520]   Although I have to say if you have to wait five to ten minutes or longer before you can go and break or have lunch
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:46.440]   I don't think it's on break getting your bag is emerged. Yeah, it says no no no it says
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.880]   They're being forced to stand around for five to 15 minutes every time they clock out for a meal break or leave work at the end of the shift
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:54.680]   I think b&a should have to pay me then because they do that too
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:56.360]   You have to give them your bag
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.200]   So you just you just hand the hand your bag in and you
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:02.520]   The first time you do it you get really defensive about it in the second after a while you just go here
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:09.240]   You got that but that's one of the complaints about uh, the conditions at the amazon fulfillment centers where you get 30 minutes for
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:14.120]   For lunch, but it's such a big complex of the break place might be a 10-minute walk away
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:17.160]   And that counts as part of your lunch break so 10-minute walk
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:23.000]   Five minutes to heat up your hot pocket and then five minutes to eat it before I start walking back to be back on time
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.120]   And that's just that's not fair
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:28.760]   I think it is fair to say hey if I have to do something and I want to I want to be paid for the the time
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:30.520]   I guess I just wouldn't bring a bag
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:34.440]   I mean if someone was making I guess you're a woman you bring a purse. I'm sorry. That's normal
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:39.640]   I understand I think they can't I don't think that's reasonable say don't bring your purse because it's gonna take you a while to get out of here
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.640]   well, I guess
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.160]   I've just left you know, I left a lot of jobs that I didn't like and I just yeah, I don't like the job
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.520]   I just agree, you know, you know, just like if that's really that big of a deal
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:54.520]   But there are rules and you got a champion for the time you inquire. It's fine
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:59.240]   It's because people are that low on the totem pole that they need to be protected right
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:05.320]   I understand but when someone like files a class action lawsuit as an employer if their names ever came up I'd be like, uh, no
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.560]   Yeah
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.560]   You never get to get to a job
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:14.040]   Is that legal to ask on a employment form? Have you ever sued a previous employer?
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:17.880]   No, you can't ask that you should be able to because that would be good
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:21.240]   I don't know but you when you see it when the name when the name comes up you can't ask that Lisa
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.840]   No, Lisa says you can't I mean you can't ask that but I can say if those two names came up
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.560]   I you know, I don't have to look out at it. I just
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:33.960]   You can ask if they're criminal if they've been arrested, but you can't ask them if they've ever sued we google everybody now
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:37.960]   I mean, you know the thing is we just so the point is if you're gonna have a class action lawsuit
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.200]   Don't trumpet it on facebook. Well, just don't put it on
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.000]   I
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.840]   I'm sure apple will settle that pretty quickly. Um
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:50.600]   Everyone will get free sandwiches
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:57.720]   Ice sandwiches for all ice sandwiches. We'll take a break. Uh, actually we don't need to take a break
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.720]   We can get to our tips right away
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:02.920]   Uh tips tools anything you want to share with the world?
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:06.840]   I think rene richies got one already queued up you fire away rene
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:13.560]   Uh, my pick of the week is dj 2 and I have to preface this by saying that I have absolutely no musical talent
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.720]   I am tone deaf and I cannot keep a beat
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:21.080]   And that makes me leery of ever looking at any music based applicant. I mean I can listen to music, but that's about it
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:25.480]   But the original dj was interesting because it was a very tactile very easy way of
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:33.240]   You know, it was like basically skeuomorphic turntables and what they've done now is they've taken that and they've taken it to an entirely new level
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:39.160]   So for example, you look at the turntable there and the actual groove marks of the music are superimposed there
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.920]   So if you're somebody who's an old school dj and you were used to being able to play something according to the grooves on the record album
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:48.360]   You can do that again. Jump to a cut based on the grooves
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:54.120]   I I had a they were nice enough. I saw the guys who made the app and I was they were nice enough to give me the complete demo for it
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:59.400]   That's a stir and they showed me that they also showed me and that's by the way album art taken from the cut
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:05.320]   So those those graphics are automatically put on the cd this next thing that you're on right now the hd waveforms leo
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:08.600]   It's amazing. You have a waveform and they color code it depending on the instrument
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:13.880]   So the voice is different than the drums. So if you're kind of looking physically see what part of a song you want to go to
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:18.120]   You can quickly find it in the waveform and not only that it will divide it
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:23.240]   And then all of those squares there are buttons and you can press those buttons almost like a keyboard to play the song
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.480]   But there's more
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:31.720]   Those little sync buttons on the top will automatically sync the song so that you can jump back and forth without having to be all skillful about it
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:36.520]   And what they've managed to do is make something that you know for me. It's a fun music player
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.160]   But they had a bunch of dj showing off
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.000]   Things that they've done with it
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.760]   And from anyone like a little kid who just wants to play in the back of a car on a road trip
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:49.160]   To someone who wants to have this next to their analog turntable in a real dj rig
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.160]   They've made a phenomenal piece of
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.880]   Of software and it works is on the iphone now as well
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:01.640]   So you can have one small little table if you just want to mess around or try something or do rough sets and rough cuts
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.480]   And it goes all the way up to the big ipad
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:09.480]   Which you can really have one turntable and put it next to your your dj rig and do stuff and the amount of depth
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:13.800]   And thought they put into it was even again someone with no musical talent
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:16.280]   I was really impressed with the app
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:20.280]   Unfortunately, it's a new app and apple does not allow upgrade pricing
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:25.400]   So what they did is make it on sale for everybody so whether you owned it before or you didn't you can get it
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.000]   I think half off
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.840]   Uh for a limited time
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.440]   But it's it's well worth the mere pittance that they are charging for it either way
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:36.520]   It was I think like 499 when they first released it. I don't know if the price has gone up yet
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:40.040]   Uh, and it's the original one one an apple design award to know their stuff
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:43.320]   So check it out though, you know the the price is gonna go up
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:49.000]   But if it hasn't already gone up, I haven't can you I can't tell can you tell I can't tell I tried to bring it up
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.040]   And I just said bought and I hate that because I know you can't I know me too
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.400]   I have to log out
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.640]   What was the what does it say?
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.880]   499 still okay good good deal
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:03.160]   First week only so run and get it now because it's gonna go up
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.760]   I don't know how much it's gonna be but it probably be at least 10 bucks it's worth 20
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:12.840]   My friends who are dj mark edwards who a friend of mine was a dj he was trying it and he fell instantly in love with it
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:13.880]   It's yeah
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.800]   Very nice pieces of work really sweet
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:19.480]   Buy it now while it's cheap even if you'll never use it
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:27.400]   Uh, mr. Lindsay that was $5. What do you got? Um, you raised us at Alex
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.920]   Um, yeah, so
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:36.840]   I you know you're gonna back down now in that $15,000 heart rate you were gonna recommend
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:39.560]   No, it wasn't 15,000
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.480]   Um, we've bought by the way everything Alex is every recommended. We've ended up buying
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:48.920]   See we have all these sound devices devices the elemental we have all this crap. No one believes me and then you go
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:51.560]   I really find it turns out that you really like it to work
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.480]   I want I just wish black magic had like a yearly fee. We just have everything they make
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:00.360]   I know the problem is I need lots of them. They make a subscription the black magic hardware
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:03.400]   We got I want a black magic hardware
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:06.840]   We're talking about becoming a resell for for a company and uh
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:12.120]   And they were like well you have to have a minimum minimum sale of this much per per year
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:15.480]   You know you have to be able to do you think you can sell that much? I'm like, uh, we could buy that
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.480]   I was like we bought that much
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:23.080]   Months have you got the black magic cinema any of these
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:27.000]   I'm waiting. I'm waiting. I'm waiting cameras. Yeah, I haven't gotten them yet. I really want
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.120]   I'm really looking at the cinema camera and the 4k camera
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:33.880]   So there's the cinema camera which uses um micro four thirds
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.480]   Uh lenses, which is very cool. Yep. That's $3,000 records in pro res or via thunderbolt
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.160]   Um and then for 4,000, we'll use the cannon mounts
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:48.840]   But it's a 4k camera. Yes, so I have a ton of good cabinet lenses. I could just pop on there
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.160]   Well, I'm I'm really um
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:56.120]   I'm really interested in uh the 4k camera the four that they have a studio switcher too
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.640]   That so you can switch in 4k and then you see the fine. Yeah
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:03.240]   So because you can barely edit 4k
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:04.760]   But I still think I have this theory
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:08.440]   I have a theory that the 4k live revolution is actually going to happen on the web
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:12.040]   Not because tv and film have already bet on hd
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:15.960]   Right and so but it's easy for youtube or netflix or apple or whatever
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.600]   Us
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.120]   You can go to 4k
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:22.600]   Right exactly so the whole thing is is that so being able to stream to 4k you could you might be able to you know
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:26.680]   That those crystal clear um things that were kind of interested so we're playing around with hd
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:29.320]   Anyway, so I think our next studio probably 4k
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:33.000]   You're the guy who did 10a p video before anybody mac break the original mac break video
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.760]   10a p
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:37.720]   You could do the first episode you couldn't edit it. You couldn't watch it
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:42.200]   There was no mac hardware that was powerful enough to play it at a normal frame rate
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.880]   This wasn't even that wide ago, right?
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:46.200]   We're already starting to expect we've done a mac break in 4k
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:48.680]   So we were already yeah, we've done one one
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.400]   It was a couple years ago and then we decided we're gonna wait for a little while longer
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:54.360]   The tools weren't quite when you're saying 4,000 for cameras
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:58.360]   So the cameras we're using now hd cameras were about 1,500 bucks each
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.720]   But we had to add
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:04.200]   Uh an s s di converter from black magic. It was 500 bucks in a special amount
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.280]   So it's about 2,500 bucks per camera
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.720]   We're not talking a huge leap to go to 4k
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.840]   It's you know black magic has really figured out how to
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.840]   you know
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:19.000]   Most of some of this stuff is new like that a lot of what black magic does is you had a great idea
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.480]   And a bad business model. So we're just going to incorporate this in
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:25.400]   You know, we'll take the thing you were selling for $80,000 and sell it for 10
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.400]   You know, and um
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.640]   And so uh, so anyway, so it's it's uh
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.040]   Yeah, we've talked to the red guy said they'd come over there you go. There's the first 10a 80 p
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.160]   That was this oh, that's 4k
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:40.760]   Oh man. Yes with south. So you south segue in uh, mr
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:44.440]   Original one with mr. Apple script and automator. Uh, look at that. Look at that
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:47.320]   You can see every pour on his forehead
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:53.320]   Every hair and his beard turned out capturing the screen at anywhere near 4k was painful
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.800]   That was the video was actually fine because we shot on a red
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:02.840]   Um, but it was uh the the screen dealing with the screen took a lot of yeah, how many bathans many bathans died
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:07.720]   So, um, you know, but the first time we've done anything like zenety p was a big mess too
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.520]   Oh, it was horrible
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:12.840]   You know, it was it took the reason that there's a if you go back in the early mac breaks and it says the road to tenety p
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.400]   The reason there's a road to tenety p is because we were so far behind releasing the first one
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.960]   And you released shows about how we're making this show how we're making the show and here and today
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.000]   To date it is still the most feud mac break ever
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.440]   Was the one where all I did was like I got to do something so I opened up
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:32.200]   I opened up a I opened up screen share and just drew one things like see this see this
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:39.240]   I did it. I hope this will work. Yeah. Yeah, it's of course. I sounded very optimistic, you know, which is the job, you know, so um
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:44.440]   So anyways, so we're we're playing with 4k. Um, what's gonna, uh, uh, uh, play back though?
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:47.320]   It's gonna be an issue of 4k, isn't it? Well, it's gonna be an issue. I mean
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.000]   What's happening?
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:54.200]   At AP tv's are gonna be you're gonna have thousand dollar 4k. I mean every every tv soul will be 4k in two years
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:57.480]   Right. I mean except for the really cheap stuff, but I mean everything that you see a Walmart
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.720]   So then bandwidth is the issue delivery becomes the issue
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:05.400]   Well, you're gonna have a whole bunch of hardware companies and a whole bunch of resellers that are all selling 4k and no one creating content for that
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:09.320]   You so they'll so all of them are gonna have how you deliver it. You're you're in an oh, you know,
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:16.280]   But but youtube is gonna go hey, you can watch 4k on youtube, you know, you know your content apples and apple
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:17.320]   Or apple
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:23.480]   Yeah, but I mean it's it's not that like when you look at h. 265 and some of the new um compression technologies
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.560]   It's gonna look very very good
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:28.360]   It's gonna look as good as 10 any p does now at 4k
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:36.040]   You know with the new with the new compression technologies even the streaming technologies and so so the um so apple and google and you know
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:39.720]   Amazon and netflix are all gonna be you know netflix. I bet you
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:45.160]   Um all their original content within the next year or two is all if it is not already being shot on 4k
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:50.200]   It'll be on 4k and netflix will go you can watch 4k on netflix and so are you done trials when we were at ces
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:56.440]   Much of the 4k content was provided by netflix right and so so the so the whole thing is is that is that all the online
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.040]   Companies are actually going to be the big the highest resolution that you can find
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.600]   And so these little cameras that black magic's creating is like the you know, it's kind of the beginning of that
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:10.520]   Um that revolution and it's it's an interesting thing for a lot of us because just like when hd happened
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:13.160]   It was a big deal to you know everyone wanted to generate content hd
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:17.000]   You know getting ahead of it, which is gonna red was honestly way ahead
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.960]   I just want to point out all I do is I stand behind Alex and I watch
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.320]   Well, he's got all figured out
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:27.720]   And once once the bleeding stops Leo goes, okay now we'll make it actually
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:34.360]   You know, yeah, exactly so so even I don't know if you have a pic. Can I ask you one other thing logic pro 10?
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:40.680]   All right, let's see anyway, so so you know, I know I will say that I've only done a cursory like I opened some stuff up
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:42.680]   persecutory
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:49.080]   It's like a thrush's word. Gursatory. I did a cursory cursory. Look, yeah, it's been a long day
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.480]   I've already been talking too much when you curse
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:53.800]   It was very so so I um
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:43:01.320]   But cursory sounds so much better. It's such a good I think it's an
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:05.400]   So anyway, so the um
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:11.000]   Cursory glance so here's the deal it is just for $200 is
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.360]   Insane it is amazing. It is insane like what this does i'm 32 gigs of loops alone
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:21.080]   Are we no it's and you keep on downloading like the thing is you install it and it goes
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.640]   Would you like to install all the plugins? It's like another 30 gigs
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:28.680]   I mean it is and you just keep on downloading from from the apple store. I like I can't believe they're giving me all these loops and
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:34.040]   Um, it is, you know, it runs really well. It's it's you know, it's so powerful and I don't I don't know
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:39.800]   I mean, you know apple obviously is what it does is it engages you in the hardware, but it's it is a
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:42.520]   Um, you know, they've really stepped it up
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:47.560]   I mean, I don't I didn't feel like I was losing anything from you know from earlier versions
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:51.400]   I just felt like it was just you know, just a wrapped up interface and now you can see
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:57.480]   You know as as apple continues to um, you know tie all these things together. I'm I get more excited
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.400]   I have to admit about
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:03.960]   Uh the mac pro because you know that all of these things are being designed to sit on that platform, you know
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:08.360]   Then they'll run even faster and so um so I think that I mean I don't usually you know
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.800]   I was I didn't want to say anything until I really got a chance to to noodle with it
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:14.840]   And I still haven't built a whole project in it. So maybe I'll come back in two weeks and go
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.240]   But I don't even know how you go wrong at $200 for an apple. I just did
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.520]   I mean I just said well, okay
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.280]   An app with that much power
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:26.600]   How you go wrong with a 200, you know paying $200 to get that is is um
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:29.720]   Uh is amazing. Yeah, so
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:33.560]   Yeah, and I installed it immediately and downloaded 32 gigabytes
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.840]   Worth of littles. I know you just keep on you know, yeah
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:39.560]   It's pretty amazing
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.280]   Um
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.280]   Andy and I call your pick of the week
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:46.920]   Uh my pick of the week is this backpack. I will explain the maker in a minute
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.480]   Uh two features of it that I really like about it
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:52.200]   It's big enough to hold a 15 inch notebook
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:55.000]   But it is super super slim so that if you're not
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.520]   There too
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.480]   To uh if all you need is the notebook and your accessories
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.400]   You don't have to basically take this huge frickin backpack with you when you travel
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:09.000]   I've been looking for something very much like this for like i'm just going to new york for a day or for an overnight
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:12.840]   I don't need I would like to not have to carry my my notebook wherever I go
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.600]   But this is so nice and slim
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.920]   But the cool thing is that this is made by cocoon
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:22.680]   They're the makers of the griddit packing system that I really really i'm sorry griddit. It's something called
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:25.560]   Griddit. Thank you
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:28.680]   Sometimes like your brain does those unhelpful things wait a minute
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.560]   Is that the name of another packing system you stopped using seven years ago Andy
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:36.840]   Anyway, but uh, I love because this is they're they're the makers of this system where
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:41.880]   It's like little like palettes of nothing but like interlocking
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:42.920]   Oh my god, look at that
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.120]   Web so
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:49.240]   What happens because the problem when you packing is that it's not that you have these things but they get buried inside pockets
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:51.960]   With this you can just take all of your accessories
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:56.360]   And just simply anywhere you want you stick them under the band
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:59.080]   Exactly. It's just kind of free form
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:01.960]   In one of those i mean
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:03.160]   Kids
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.560]   Put your kid under there just no it's like, you know, and your
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.520]   And literally everything and they have and they have lots and lots of stretch to them
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.760]   So even if you had like a really really thick and bulky item like I bet
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:21.080]   You know like here is like of course I need to I need to have my my the clips that I use to hold on to my
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:23.880]   uh, hold on to my uh
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.720]   Uh, my my my my windows together
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:29.720]   And so since they flex and they stretch they just simply stay right there
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:35.320]   And so once you have it all loaded up, essentially you don't have to dig through anything to find whatever cable
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:37.320]   Whatever adapter whatever thing is you need
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.360]   It's just a big not but if you had a can it's really a great place
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:44.520]   Exactly
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:48.040]   First of all we call it. We call it cha. Sorry
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:51.240]   Dilleton
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:56.040]   But yeah, I mean and you and by the way, you can also you can go to cocoon technologies
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:02.680]   I believe that this cocoon innovations calm cocoon innovations calm that has the whole line of products like this
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:08.840]   And I used to I've been a big fan of them ever since their main product was the what you're looking at right there in the screenshot
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:12.680]   Which is just these flat like pallets you can then put into any bag because
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:17.480]   I I have the I have the little ipad bag. I have the slightly larger bag for 13 inch notebooks
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:20.680]   And you know they have they they'll have like a zippered outside pocket
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:25.160]   But then you have to empty out the entire pocket because all you need is
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:30.280]   Is your earphones and you can't just get at them. This let you just get at that one thing
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:33.400]   So you whip you whip the little thing out and everything
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:39.400]   Or you're kidding me a big thing out and you get uh you got everything is in there
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:47.640]   Exactly. So I'm I'm glad to see that they're now putting like embedding this in like actual laptop cases because that like saves saves one step
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:52.040]   This is the this is the the the backpack that they set me across 79 99
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.800]   But they also have like a really nice 13 inch notebook case that's kind of on this idea
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.200]   It's not a backpack. It's a regular like, you know, sort of uh
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:07.800]   Satchel sort of thing but again use unzip unzip a flap and reveal like this entire deck where every single thing you need is
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:11.080]   Nicely organized or if you keep it nicely organized that is
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:16.360]   And easily accessible. So if you need a backpack if you need a laptop case good choice
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:19.480]   But even if you don't if you're if you're happy with the case that you have already
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:25.080]   Get one of these little palettes because they make them in so many different sizes and it's it's not only
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:29.960]   It doesn't just save you trouble when you're trying to get access to something when i'm packing
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:33.400]   I have a big one that goes on top of my uh, my my rollaway
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:38.440]   Uh, and so, you know, you're you're packing and it's like an hour before you're gonna leave and you think wait a minute
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.760]   There's so many times i've taken like three different three identical usb chargers
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:47.320]   Because I wasn't completely certain that i packed one and so by the time when I get to the hotel
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:53.480]   It's like, okay, so you put one in this outside bag one inside the bag and another one inside this other pouch because you work sure
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:58.920]   With this you simply look at this one little palace. Yep. There's my usb charger. Don't need another one. I'm good
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:04.840]   So i'm i mean you can get bags, but i'm thinking i want to put this in my carry-on
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:09.160]   Yeah, uh, just one of these i'll have to measure it and figure out what the inside is like
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:12.520]   Because i could just when i get on the plane just pop it in i'll get going for you too
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:15.560]   Because i was going to mention and this is a little more expensive than your grid it
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:20.520]   Uh, but but i've been you know i've got a trip coming up and i've been looking for the perfect
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:26.360]   uh carry-on, uh bag and i see people with roller bags for their carry-ons and i
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:29.000]   And i regret not having that i have a lot of laptop bags
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.880]   Because you know you check in you get rid of your heavy luggage
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.920]   But then you have to carry around this bag for the rest of the time
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.360]   I mean if it's if it's got your laptop and your ipad and your camera and a bunch of other stuff
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:42.520]   My measurement or my backpack is is that it's too heavy if i can't feel my hands after 45
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:47.400]   So, uh, i went to Briggs and Riley and they sell very nice
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:50.040]   Stuff i'm a big fan
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:54.840]   And got their roller carry-on that now they have one that's small enough to fit into like even the
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:59.640]   Commuter jets, which right, you know you could put like a roll of lifesavers in that luggage carrier up there
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:04.520]   Uh, and it has it's it's not four wheels it's too although it looks like they have a four-wheel one as well here
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:08.040]   Don't do it. What don't get the four get the two wheel. Yeah
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:12.280]   And then and it's got a really cool. Let me see if i can enough i don't know if this is the one i
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:14.920]   The rolling cabin bag i think it is
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.360]   um
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:22.760]   And then it uh, it then it also if it's under the seat but also it open instead of being like a laptop bag when it opens up
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:25.080]   It's just a big bag
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.000]   That you could put clothes in and then it has a laptop pouch in the front
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.360]   So i'm thinking if i put the grid it inside there to hold my stapler
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:38.200]   Yeah, you do you carry a stapler on a line?
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:40.360]   Well, you know, yeah, you need a stapler if
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:45.880]   Because we leave a red swing line back of the back of the brick house someone's gonna nick they steal it every time i come back from my trip
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:48.120]   And my swing line's gone. So i'm bringing my stapler wing
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:54.120]   Uh, so very cool. I mean I like these Briggs and Riley's I will bring mine in and you can look at it
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:55.880]   Well, I like tried it. I liked it so much
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:58.200]   I got one for Lisa too because we're going on vacation in september
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:02.360]   So we'll have this when we get on the plane you roll no longer have to lift
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:08.360]   Folds up, but even has this little back handle that flips around so it goes on the other luggage when the roller is up
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:14.280]   And attaches securely lots of nice little thing brings me Riley makes nice stuff 20 years old by the way, they're celebrating
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:17.240]   so
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:19.400]   But that's 329 bucks so
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:25.560]   I want to put the 15 dollar grid it in there 40 dollar grid it in there and be very very happy
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:31.240]   I have them in three different sizes. They're really I i'm so excited. I've never seen such a thing and it really works
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:36.680]   It's I I wish I unfortunately I was busy up until like five minutes before the show
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:42.760]   Or else I would have taken the one that I keep that just it has one copy of of of an iPhone charger cable
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:49.320]   One copy of a usb of a micro usb cable one copy of a 10 watt charger one copy of
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:55.560]   Like everything that I need when i'm spending three hours at a coffee shop and the great and it's all organized
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:52:02.280]   Also another key is to have a duplicate of everything so that this is this is where that one copy of that cable goes
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:06.120]   Yes, it will. Oh, I don't have to be on rob peter to pay paul anywhere in the house
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:09.080]   It's where that thing won ball. So i'm going to buy another stapler
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:13.240]   Certainly one at home and put one of my grid it and then I'll always have it the ream of paper
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:20.120]   The stapler the whole punch you should also have like NFC tags on each one of those things so that you can with people
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:23.480]   You can skip check it in and check it out. Yeah of every room that you go in
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:30.520]   Now they have aluminum and I don't know what the other one is do you recommend the metal or is there a lot of torque on the
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.000]   I guess it's probably plastic the other one
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.680]   um
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:40.120]   Aluminum they say they double side of the room and they make they make different they make different kinds of
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:42.280]   I use you have a probably
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.680]   I have like a first I have the first generation ones that aren't even backed with like metal or plastic
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:47.480]   Okay
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:50.360]   The because the because if you if you do over on that
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:55.320]   I think maybe that was like an innovation to give you two-sided storage right or something
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:59.800]   It's double-sided so you got one side and you got the other side and then you really got some
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:02.680]   Here you go now you're cooking with gas now you're cooking with gas
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:05.000]   I could have two staplers and a roll of stamps
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.080]   And emolles
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:11.800]   Replacement staples let a little let her open her extra staplers, extra staples
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:19.800]   Very very handy. I am ready for this trip. We're going on an office supply cruise. It's going to be so great. Yeah, I'm very excited

[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.680]   Stop being so thorough

[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:03.320]   So much sympathy and empathy from fellow writers in my life that when I tweeted
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:08.680]   Today facing the task of like screenshotting and putting these things that this is for every tech
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:16.360]   Even no matter how long I'm running about technology doing screenshots and stuff like that is still like eating vegetables
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:21.880]   I will push them to the side of the plate. It is the last thing I will do because I hate it so much
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:28.200]   It's like not creative. It's just technical and boring and it has to be done and I just got oh man
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:34.440]   This is the worst thing too. I hate doing that. I want to I want to get rich enough that I could just hire some high school kid to do it for me
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:39.880]   My entire photo stream is filled with screenshots right now. Oh, I hate that. Hey that feeling
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:43.880]   That's rene richie. I'm more.com if you want to follow him and he also

[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:57.880]   We tried to make it as fun as possible
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:04.360]   And one thing that might be interesting to people who are nerdier as I spend an hour with guy english talking about the new mac pro
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:09.240]   And open cl and what those giant gpu's mean and that's in our vector podcast
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:15.400]   It's it's nerdy, but it's really like he sees a whole new entirely different version of software coming for devices
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:19.560]   Yeah, I will certainly buy one of those mac pros just for my personal use
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:25.240]   But we are really trying we're up in the air here because we are at the point now where we have mac old mac pros
