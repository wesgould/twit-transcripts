[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.120]   It's time for Mac break weekly the show we get together with a great team of people and talk about Apple
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:44.040]   Lori Gill is here. She's a senior editor of course at imore.com. It's great to see you managing editor is which is better senior or managing oh
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.560]   You know labels
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.560]   One of them here's you're one of them. You're an important person. I tell you what to do. That's all that matter
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.920]   Yeah, that's right. Do you still get to write as a managing editor or you just not as much as I want to yeah
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.320]   It's harder. Yeah, good team though, and it's all distributed right. There's no office
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.400]   No office. We all work remotely everyone's in a different place all over the world
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.360]   We have some people that live in different countries and stuff too, and that's not covid. That's just the way it is
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.880]   That's just the way it is. I know our our larger corporate parents
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.760]   They do have offices so when everyone had to start working from home. It was really funny to see our co-workers just
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.200]   Unable to handle how I work from home. I'm really even doing this for years
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.240]   Funny you talk about future. That's a future. That's right. Yes. I think I think Renee told us they have a New York office
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.560]   Which is a new York office and they have a bath office and I think England which is an a London office
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.200]   Yeah, yeah, Alex Lindsey is also here just fresh off his office hours
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.720]   Hi, Alex
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.680]   Hello 090 dot media if you need to stream. This is the cat. This is the guy who can do it and
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.840]   office hours
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.260]   Seen seven days a week on YouTube 7 a.m. Pacific
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.720]   It's we're set five days a week on YouTube
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.240]   And then seven days a week on zoom so we we do one one of the hours we do on
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.560]   One of the hours that we why would you do it or not put it on YouTube? Is that the secret hours?
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.880]   Well, it's just that we don't work that way. We don't have to worry about
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.960]   releases like your second hour that you're doing we could probably do if we wanted to but the
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:36.240]   For many of the folks we bring on then we'd have to talk to them about can we put this on YouTube and course everything else
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.680]   And so there's you know, so we have permission to do that because they're working
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.200]   Yeah, and so so it's easier to just just do one and rather than trying to change it per day
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.360]   We just decided to have it as a general rule that
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.320]   And the hour before that is really relaxed and so we talk about a lot of things
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.000]   It's not really worth putting on YouTube
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.720]   So there's just one hour that is just pure q&a
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.800]   And so we decided to go ahead and put that up on YouTube so people could get a sense of it
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.600]   And the weekends we take off to because I just don't want to think about it
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.680]   So so we we don't we because we do seven hours on saturday and then what three hours on sunday
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.800]   You just are running all day
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.680]   Are you cherry louis? Are you racing money for something?
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.560]   Yeah, exactly if you start sitting you'll never walk alone. I'm gonna really
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.440]   Who are you?
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.680]   Saturday is what we call the long day, which is that we we do two hours of q&a and then we do uh, we do four
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.280]   One hour sessions so we have like, um, you know, nick joshishin from drexel universities doing unreal
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.240]   And then steve bays who used to be the senior product manager for final cut does final cut deep cuts
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.720]   So we get it pretty much from the guy who ice, you know, it's on the team and then
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.840]   And then we have alex goldner from uh that does a ton of work for the bbc
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.600]   Do it showing how live stuff, you know graphics get built and stuff like that and then and then um, but we range all over the place from unreal to
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.440]   You know other things like, you know and final cut in production. So it's so it's very it is very you know for
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.400]   Mac leaning, but there's definitely plenty of folks that are using other other software as well
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.680]   So I am totally intimidated, but I am going to be on thursday
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.280]   It's it we're so excited to have you everyone's everyone's excited because there's a lot of mac break listeners that are that are already in it
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.760]   Because they've heard about us talking about it here. So right so there's a ton of people that are excited
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.000]   We should mention there's a limit of 500 total people that can can attend so
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   Uh, you can see after the fact
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.280]   But yeah, so there's you want to get there, uh, you know, we we open the doors
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.760]   Uh again at six a.m. Uh leo won't be on until eight, uh, so but um, that's like at six
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.080]   But yeah, it's limited to 500 concurrent and so um, uh, we haven't hit that number yet
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.000]   But we have thought about that the thursday may be I want to make it up there
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.520]   So everybody's tuned it
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.320]   So it's at youtube.com/allaxlindz for the after show but uh for the
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.080]   Produced version but you can you can there's a link at that page in the comments, uh to the actual zoom
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.360]   seminar
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.520]   Yeah, and if you want to the easier to remember a link is just it's just bitly slash the office hours
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.640]   Oh, nice. So it's so it's if you I finally realized I should probably make something that was easier to remember
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.440]   So if you do be a bit dot l y
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.680]   Slash the office hours you'll get to the zoom registration and you can you can jump in there and and uh and register
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.760]   And then you know if you don't want to get emails from us then cancel it later
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.720]   But but there's we had today
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.520]   We had uh one of the designers from sound devices talking about how their noise assist works and and uh tomorrow we're spending an hour talking about lenses
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.480]   So um so anyway, so it's a pretty fun if you like media geek geekery. It's a pretty uh pretty fun morning
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.920]   Uh
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.800]   Are you sure it's the office
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.680]   Hours it should be bitly
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.560]   B it dot l y slash
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.400]   The office hours that brings me to a youtube channel called the office hours
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.440]   Really? Yeah, that's
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.040]   So we'll get you the bit late podcast about the office maybe
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.760]   Uh
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.640]   No, it looks like they're reenacting the office
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.280]   Children reenacting the office. I think I don't know. That's interesting. He's like when I put it in
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.320]   uh
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.840]   B it dot l y slash the office hours
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:35.520]   That's t h e o f f i c e h o u r s
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.720]   Or no s yep
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.440]   With an s
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.640]   Anyway
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:51.680]   Hi, Alex and you know the link is available on the youtube channel youtube dot. Yeah, you get it Alex lensy and also with us
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.720]   Oh
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.720]   It's it's something I just learned
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.000]   I didn't realize that bitlies are our case defendant. So it's the office hours. It has the gift account
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.200]   So that's not very useful. Never mind. It's it's because it's uh
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.640]   Uh
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.880]   They suddenly for someone with 42 subscribers won't understand why everybody came there after they haven't done
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:15.280]   So it's capital t capital o capital h capital h and I I thought I just I didn't realize that it was that
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.680]   That's interesting. I didn't know it was case sensitive either. I didn't either. Yeah, now we've learned
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.000]   There's there's something learned that something new that we learned about really is that it's case sensitive
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.520]   We are only six minutes into the show and you've learned something
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.400]   See you see and we haven't even introduced uh, ani and ako yet
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.960]   Hello, andrew it's great to have you back. That's one to grow on. Hi could be back
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   We rotate just as a
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.800]   Note because there's so many people who want to be on the show. We rotate one person out every week
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.880]   So rene is odd man out this week as and he was last week. He'll be back next week
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.400]   And uh, we thank you for uh your understanding, but I think this show particularly
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.120]   Everybody has a lot to say
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.160]   And it's better if we have fewer people on it and I will also shut up just to make more room
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.800]   How about that? We now know there will be a key well, we knew that'd be a keynote
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.600]   We know what time 10 a.m. On monday
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.640]   WW DC 2020 kicks off
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.120]   I presume it's tim apple, but we do know it's coming from the steve jobs theater
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:24.080]   Uh, and i'm thrilled excited more excited than I have been in a while for wwdc
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.520]   Something new something different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be interesting. Sorry
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.680]   Go ahead. It's it's one of the things that might be even make it more interesting is the idea of do they do the entire keynote live
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.160]   Or do they have some stuff pre taped in which case they could have a much much deeper bench of talent to draw upon
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.720]   Or they might be able to give far far more substantive information and demonstrations from there
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.120]   So it's just it's sort of like just like it was exciting for the first couple of weeks to see
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.960]   Uh, see like jimmy fowlan and everybody all the late night hosts have to do shows from their rooms from their bedrooms
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.760]   And they've never done before it's going to be interesting to see apple to try to give this keynote without like 3,000 cheering people
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.520]   Of which like 500 500 800 are like apple people
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.440]   Uh
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.080]   They wouldn't they won't have to be able to say to insert applause breaks into the script for the for the keynote
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.120]   the uh
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.200]   Microsoft developer
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.960]   Event had a mix
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.320]   Some of the stuff was pre-recorded and some of it was live maybe it's just me but I could always tell
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.040]   When it was pre-recorded because the energy was worse
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:37.600]   It just felt canned the live stuff that microsoft did including their main keynote with scott hanselman was fantastic because it was live
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.960]   If well, I think that there's an there's a subtle energy that you get
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.120]   Um from from doing a live event that is just really hard to produce when you start to
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.160]   Now have control over every perfect edit and all the close-ups and everything else and it's been rehearsed
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.240]   It just doesn't feel the same
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.480]   You can make something that's great, but you then have to make it much better
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.160]   So I think that when you don't do live you get you really have to
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   Up the production value. You can't just do a stage version
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.720]   Um pre-recorded and have it have the same energy as the live version of that
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.160]   Um, so, you know, I think we talked in the past about connections connections is great
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.440]   It's not live. You know, he figured it all out, but it's very well produced
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.000]   So yeah, yeah, yeah, no absolutely
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.520]   So some of the some of the best television most of it is not live
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.960]   But I think for I think for a presentation like a keynote, it's noticeable
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.160]   I prefer a lot of questions obvious questions that we do we need a presentation like a keynote, but that's a whole nother
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.920]   Discussion, you know, I think we do though because we need to be that you know
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.640]   Apple likes to kind of like be in control of the story that's being told
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.080]   They like to have the narrative and if they don't give us the narrative to talk about and write about
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   Then we just kind of make it up as we go along and it may not kind of fit
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.000]   What they wanted us to know about something so for new
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Features and an operating system or something like that if they just said here's a list of all the new features
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.200]   That nothing would get called attention to it so that we wouldn't know what to assume would be like the most important feature
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.880]   So I do think a keynote is important to generate the kind of buzz that apple's really good at
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.160]   I think you could make one the thing is you could take a all I would say is that you could take a two-hour
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.760]   keynote
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.040]   You could cut it down and create a highly produced one hour that would say all the things that you want to say very fast
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.000]   And but it would look like a real show, you know, rather than trying to have it be people up there
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.800]   Trying to do that. Yeah
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   Go ahead, Annie
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.800]   And we have seen what happens when
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:50.080]   You try to create a big launch that has a lot of subtle things to it without having an organized like hour-long
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.200]   We we we were the the company knows that you know that this is propaganda
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:01.760]   But nonetheless, this is at least the propaganda that they it's interesting to see what what features and what technologies
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.080]   They specifically want to highlight google got the double whammy of they were going to announce android 11
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.080]   During during the may google I/O that got canceled because of coronavirus
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.840]   Then they were going to have android 11 as a big live launch event on youtube
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.160]   But then they decided had a good taste to to cancel that because of the black lives matter protest
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:30.400]   And so they were left essentially with just a whole bunch of developer oriented videos posted to youtube and a blog post and that left a big big
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.480]   That wasn't very common for commentators yet to have to say okay. Well now we have the beta now
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.280]   We're going to have to explain on our own terms what doesn't matter what google thinks is important
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.440]   Doesn't matter how google shows something off. We're going to have to dig through this ourselves and come up with our own
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.320]   That's what a keynote really a bad thing. That's what a keynote is. It's spin. It's context
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:55.520]   I mean, there's two ways to put it. So I would say it's spin, but it's contextualization, right lory. It's it's telling people what's important
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.320]   Right. Yeah, this is
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.600]   I'm sorry go ahead lory. I interrupted
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.680]   This is exactly what i'm saying that you know apple likes to make sure that they kind of have control over how
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.080]   This information is presented to us. We can disseminate it all we want afterward
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.560]   But they're the ones who are going to say stuff like you know
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:21.440]   There's a new ecg feature or a new sleep feature on the iphone or on the um watch o s, you know
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.280]   They're going to call attention to that because they they they worked on it
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.080]   They think it's a great feature. They want to push that feature if they just give us a big list of things
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.920]   We have to figure out of the hundreds and hundreds of features
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.440]   Which ones are the most important one?
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.000]   They want to tell us which ones are the most important ones and then later we get to kind of
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Weed through all the other stuff and find other features we think are fun
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   But but out of the gate
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.160]   And all keynotes are this so they wouldn't they wouldn't live stream them if they weren't meant as a marketing tactic to get us
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.240]   Interested in what's to come yeah
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.600]   Well in a lot of ways the the keynotes are still for the press in some ways because
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.720]   Even you know for a long time apple didn't live stream and that's you know leo live stream them from from the
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.040]   So lately
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.760]   The former journalist known as leo yeah
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.960]   Yeah, so so I think that for a while apple decided that we're they're only going to put press
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.160]   In that in that position and then spin it just to the press
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.600]   So I do agree with you that that a lot because in in reality from a popular pure popular perspective
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.640]   The most viewed thing is usually the highlight reel the tenor, you know the eight or ten minutes
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.800]   So just tell me what you actually released. Yeah, you know is is all most of that true
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.600]   Is that the biggest view numbers? I guess I make if you look on youtube, I think those numbers are pretty nice
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.240]   So we're so obsessed that we watch every freaking minute of it
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.440]   Yeah
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   Analyze it and watch it again
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.920]   Freeze frame it and look at the words on the screen and see what that means literally yeah
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.800]   We do it's one of the reasons I don't mind not being in the room because
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.840]   I think you get it's less like watching a baseball game
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.800]   In the stands versus at home
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.080]   It's you get the the ambiance and the fun and the smell of the popcorn in the crowd at the game
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.960]   But if you really want to see what's going on the television coverage is always is always the best way to watch absolutely
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.520]   And from a commentary perspective, it's much easier to do commentary on the keynote because it's not moving very fast. Yeah
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.160]   Now I have to say
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   uh, there is a range
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.000]   uh google's developers conference is always
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.040]   A little bit for developers and a little bit for the press
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.680]   Microsoft's this year was really for developers. They made no pretense
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.160]   Even when such an Adele was talking
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.920]   It really wasn't a it was certainly not a very if it wasn't intended for the press. It wasn't very effective
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.760]   Apple is kind of on the other side of the spectrum. They everything apple does is about marketing
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.640]   Uh even to developers and then they have the stuff in the side that you don't see but when they stream well
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.800]   Yeah, that's that's for the press and that's for the people
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.560]   And I believe that they're streaming all the things they normally stream on the first day of dub dub which is the
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.680]   Uh, they'll have the keynote, which is very different
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.360]   But then there's the state of the union and then there is the the awards. Is that right? Are those those
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.080]   29th
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.640]   29th, but but they have they have three events that usually happen on that first day and I think that those are all be streaming
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.320]   And what they do is they those the second two tend to be very developer focused, you know and not really
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.480]   um publicly focused so they have a couple more opportunities to talk to the developers and so but the first one is definitely for the developers
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.520]   but leaning towards the press and then the other ones start to get much more into the nitty gritty
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.480]   And then of course you have a whole week of getting really into the into the weeds
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.040]   It's interesting because I think apple really has come around for a while they didn't stream any of these now
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.400]   It's on the apples
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:41.600]   This is the apple website and they're saying not just to developers to everybody add to your calendar so you can watch the keynote
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.200]   I mean they they really want everybody to watch I think and you've been able to watch the
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.240]   the wwdc
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:59.360]   Sessions from the developer website. So it's been pretty easy to access these things all along they they almost
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.280]   Had it all
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.360]   It's like they had all the buttons ready to be sewn up
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.120]   Before this happened because there was they were already doing so much
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:15.760]   um, not live streaming but like allowing you to to watch the sessions after they happened so this is definitely kind of
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.320]   the next step in that process and since they
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:25.680]   Added support to different devices so that you can access the developer app on you know your mac and on
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.840]   apple tv. I really think that it's going to help a lot of people that are
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:35.200]   They don't want to just sit there and use their focus. I think the developer up is really kind of just been a way to
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:44.000]   When you're there get more information whereas now it's kind of being treated as this is where you find your information
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.560]   And I like that they've opened that up to
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.280]   They say right at the top download the app. That's what they want to
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.680]   Yeah, but only they know it so good luck. Sorry, Andy
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.720]   I
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   It looks like it only you have
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.640]   If you have to be a developer and says well, no, it says it requires Catalina
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.120]   Oh, I could be oh, yeah
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.440]   And that's like I have I'm going to have to and I have to I will have to create a wc specific boot drive because I'm
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.000]   I have not put Catalina on any of my working max
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.880]   Because I don't want to take that leap to a tighter sandbox mac until I absolutely need one
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.360]   Well, and also if you're going to use the app you have to be a developer and I was about to pay the 99 bucks
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.840]   And now it wants a picture of my driver's license and
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.960]   This is there's a little bit of a speed bump. Go ahead. Alex. We I'm sorry
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.960]   I'm sorry I didn't remember all I can say is that it's still the the
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.400]   I mean, we'll see what happens with this app with it with the with the videos that are there but up until
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:43.680]   At least through this up until this app was released and until we've seen it work the best place to view the developer stuff is on chrome
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.200]   Right
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.800]   Because you can not you can download an extension that allows you to play back quickly
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.440]   Right
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.240]   The problem is watching sessions whether it's from google or microsoft or or facebook or apple
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.880]   Watching developer sessions at one x is just it's just brutal
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.760]   Like it's just really like why why do we need to do that? Like there's no
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.440]   It's it's the most insane decision process of not having
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.000]   Uh, you know not being able to go to 1.5 or 1.75x or maybe even 2x
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Holy
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   This is something I've never thought of
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.080]   Yeah me neither. Oh my god
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.520]   I listen at 1x
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.280]   Lisa and Alex my wife
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.920]   You're living in double speed to everything they're
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.400]   Their brains work better than ours. I guess
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.240]   Well, I guess for me the the problem that I have I mean, I don't and I think part of it's an audible thing that I listen to books
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.880]   That you know that speed all the time and that's too the issue the issue is is that I have
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.240]   Um, there are definitely sessions that I have to slow down on
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.520]   But but for me that just takes them so long to get to the it takes everybody so long to get to the point
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.760]   They just want you just want to go faster and so um the uh
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.920]   But I think that for me I get my brain get saturated at about between 1.5 and 2 my brain gets saturated
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.280]   With the content and then I don't think about anything else. I'm able to focus
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.560]   When when information is coming to me really slowly, I'm thinking about six other things while people are talking
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.800]   So it's very hard for me to remember what they said
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.520]   So anyway, so so I need I need it to go faster and actually
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:15.440]   I'm being silly and teasing you because there's a significant amount of evidence that the faster
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:21.520]   The content comes in the years the better it's understood again because you're not you're not having other thoughts that are right unrelated
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.680]   At the same time you're you're pulling all that information and and it's you know
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   You can do that in a bunch of different ways you can play it faster. You can also create denser content
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.880]   I think we talked about this when we were talking about connections is I can't
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.000]   Play connections at 2x, you know, you can't keep you
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Yeah, that one's a real time
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.240]   But like in our house if someone's playing connections and gets played a lot
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.680]   Um
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.920]   No one's a lot of talk in the living room because you can't you're you're afraid of losing like a couple words
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.080]   And so we should we should be well clarify for people who weren't here a couple of weeks ago
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:57.280]   We're talking about a very famous tv show called connections by historian james berg
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.720]   Which was on he's still around by the way leo he is like a triangulation with james berg
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.400]   Would be oh my god. I think as I remember we've been trying to get him for like 10 years
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.840]   Okay. Yeah, oh my god. I'm a huge fan. This was the 70s wasn't it? This was a little time ago
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.800]   I was posting about I was posting about I think I talked about this
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.400]   But I was posting that I that I wanted alton brown to team up with iLM and do a new connections and alton brown immediately came on and said
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.680]   While I was designing good eats. I was binging on connections. So good eats is basically connections
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.520]   Everybody was hugely influenced by this tv show
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.720]   And I should correct myself. It was on bbc initially
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.640]   I think in the united states it was aired on public broadcasting because of course it was way too brainy for nbc
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.120]   CBS
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.640]   And most of it is on us still on the you were you're watching it on the internet archive, but most of it is also on youtube
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.600]   So
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:55.520]   Um, you can you can watch the show still today and it's it is well worth it. So the special event
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.440]   keynote
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:04.160]   Is 10 a.m. monday june 22nd followed and I don't think we're going to stream this followed by the state of the union at 2 p.m
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.960]   Should we stream it? What is the state of the union larry? What are they do at the state of the union?
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   It's basically the way
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.720]   Alex was describing it. It's kind of the more brainy deep dive stuff
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:22.640]   So whatever apple announces at the keynote, it's broad stroking and it's kind of a general
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.600]   Here's a demo. Here's how it's done and then the state of the union is more like here's the code
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.120]   And here's how you would they actually it's a little more brainy
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.160]   This time it's titled maybe it always is but this time it's it's titled platforms state of the union
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   So it's gonna be mac OS IOS
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.880]   TV OS watch OS that kind of thing and it goes over all the same stuff. It just goes into it with a little bit more
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:50.800]   I toured the developer instead of I toured like the press or the general public
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.520]   So it's really the same keynote done twice once for the normies and one for the geese
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.160]   There's more
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.200]   Go ahead
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   There's so much to talk about
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.760]   Of what's new in dub dub that you can't the keynote is like the 10,000
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.840]   You the the state the next one is a thousand feet and then the sessions are the hundred feet and below
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.520]   apple saying
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.320]   June 23rd to 26th so tuesday through friday
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.800]   100 plus engineering sessions
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.880]   Watch on the web or the apple developer app on iphone ipad and apple tv
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.000]   They're also creating developer forums
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.240]   So that's interesting and they're going to put their engineers on the forum. So this is how they're going to have the interactivity
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:38.320]   Starting the first day of the conference eligible members can connect with apple engineers. They're going to put a thousand engineers in there
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.240]   uh over the wwdc content on the forums
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.640]   There are also by appointment developer labs for one-on-one guidance
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.880]   If you're lorn britter you can go there and say hey, how does that work?
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.280]   You know, yeah, what's this that's gonna be?
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.680]   That's going to be a really important thing for them to implement somehow because a lot of developers look forward to wwdc
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.040]   As a time to talk directly to an engineer saying here is specifically the problem i'm having
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.240]   Transitioning my app from one platform to another here's what i want my app to do
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.320]   But i'm not allowed to do it
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.200]   Under under restrictions that are under the app store. How am i supposed to do that?
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.840]   How do we get around with it and this is an opportunity for engineers to speak directly and frankly
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:26.080]   Because it's it's it's not for public consumption is for here's how who is us trying to solve your problem with you
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.360]   So it's not only specifically trying to solve problems for specific developers, but it's also good outreach
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.640]   So this is something that a lot of developers buy that ticket for to make sure they get that facetime and they
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.800]   Essentially get that face in their logbook has someone they can talk to in the future
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.640]   So this is going to be that was something that was going to be really important for apple to replicate
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.120]   If they're going to be doing a remote wwdc. I'm guessing they're not using zoom to do that
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.800]   No, they use the using google meet
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.040]   Yeah
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.800]   And then you were right the awards are the following monday on the 29th
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.600]   It is yeah, usually the the awards actually take place the second or third day
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.320]   I think it's usually the second day of wwdc, but they're actually postponing it till the
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:15.040]   Um, the conference is completely over this year. It's gonna be a doing it though. Oh gosh. Yeah, the designer words are
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.480]   I'm sure for developers. I haven't seen any information about it
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.840]   And then I just recently read that they they're holding it on the 29th
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.240]   So I was really happy to see that it's happening. So nice
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.560]   Yeah, they were the big prizes just that placement on the app store for that period of time
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.600]   Or so yeah, if they delayed that a couple of weeks, that's a couple of weeks of money that they get that they miss out on
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.880]   They're also doing the swift student challenge
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:42.000]   So you uh is actually in a in swift playgrounds, I think
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.800]   So uh you create a swift playground on the topic of your choice
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:53.440]   Winners will get the highly coveted wwdc 20 jacket and pin set
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.560]   How else can we get that? I want that. Yeah
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.600]   The uh swift student challenge winners were actually announced and oh, it's over
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:08.400]   The the great yeah the great thing about it was everybody won it was 350 entrance and 350
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.680]   Oh, which I thought was really sweet. Oh, that's really great
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:18.080]   This is well, it's also a little bit like like a big treasure hunt and then we find out. Oh, the price was love
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.320]   We'll think about this. Oh, Andy. What's still come on
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.040]   Think about this usually
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.520]   You know, however many people attend wwc get the jacket and pins right?
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:37.360]   There are only 350 people with those jacket and pins and it's those swift developer challenge students like they did win
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.440]   They want something really cool
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.840]   This is so cool. Do any of them take like a size 46 jacket
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.480]   and
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.960]   I'm sure one or two will go on ebay
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   Uh, you know
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.520]   So wishes expensive these days a lot of them are there you go a lot of them have to pay college tuition
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.520]   I guess these are i'm looking at the the newsroom announcement of the winners
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.160]   I which was on the 16th. So shame of me. Oh, no, that's today. Nevermind. It's just
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.120]   It just happened this morning. Yeah
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:13.680]   Are these the pins or are I love the I love to go? I don't think we've seen the pins. I want the I love to code pin
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.760]   That's really cool
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.480]   Um
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.680]   neat neat stuff and read the press release because some of these
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.720]   Some of these kids are going to change the world. Uh, this is really really exciting
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.360]   Stuff from all of them. There's nothing more
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:33.840]   Nothing more exciting than like really really young people who have not been taught what won't work and what has been tried before
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.760]   They just have an idea. I mean they're ahead of what they want to exist and then they make it exist
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.080]   Well, and that's by the way, I got to point out the beauty of swift and the platform
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:49.280]   Is uh, you can be a high schooler and develop something pretty pretty polished and so yeah amazing
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:55.680]   No, it's I'm so jealous of of young people who who are learning to code because every 10 years
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:02.480]   I really have to it was so tough to break myself out of the pre-object oriented programming
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.560]   mindset that I had molded my brain on since I was like 10 years old it was there
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.760]   There were kids that were like I was like 22 23
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.720]   And their kids were like 10 years old and because they started learning like objective languages
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.800]   It's like, uh, but wait a minute. You don't have to do a loop wait a minute. Where does where did you break out of the it's?
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.760]   Oh, he it was so it's exciting now that when you have people kids who uh,
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.240]   not now are growing up knowing that
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.680]   Uh, you can the best the best way to write an effective program that does magical fangs
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.520]   Is to write as little right only the most specific code to your app as possible
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:48.560]   And support the framework that you've been given because not only were there there are a lot of like older programmers that are
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.760]   suffering right now in the in the app store because they uh, uh,
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.560]   They have been trained to
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:02.320]   Solve a problem. However, it has to be solved if the if the systems that apple gives them first
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:08.080]   For writing certain pieces of code doesn't work. They will find a way to work around it to make sure that their app does what they want
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:14.160]   Whereas a younger developer is going to say, oh, wow. Well, look here's this brand new and here's here's this brand new system for networking
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.000]   I'm certainly going to use this stack. I'm not gonna have i'm not going to do any modifications to it
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.440]   I'm not going to uh, use the 10 year old stack that I created myself and because it's what our entire
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.240]   Shop is is based on
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:32.960]   This is this is why a 12 year old can rocket so far ahead a 20 year old 30 40 year old programmer
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:39.920]   Well, and saw the winners include the Sophia angela. She is a sophomore at fordham university created an app
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.360]   Uh for resources for survivors of sexual assault
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.360]   Uh
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.200]   Another one is a palesh to nay to nayja. He grew up in new deli
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:57.680]   He got den gay fever when he was a kid. So he created an app that will predict how mosquito-borne diseases would spread
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.360]   But my favorite is this one from devan green. He's a high school senior in castra valley california
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:09.680]   devan had trouble getting up in the morning so he designed a program that uses a pressure mat under his mattress
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.800]   If the weight is still on the mattress after he's supposed to be up and alarm goes off
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.240]   But he can't stop the alarm until he uses his phone to scan a qr code
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.520]   He says there are 12 qr codes around my house and they're randomized every morning
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:32.800]   So I never know where to go to shut the alarm off. Oh my god. That was that was like when my first apple script
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.080]   I don't know if it was my first hyperscript from my first apple script where it was it was an alarm clock
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.680]   That would choose a random number and then calculate the square the square of it
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:49.040]   Display that square and it would not turn off the volume until I typed in with the square root of that number was
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.240]   Oh, that's perfect
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:50.880]   Oh, wow
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.400]   Kills two birds with one stone you get to learn your square roots
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.280]   And you'll wake up get up
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.120]   He by the way, he's graduating this year, which is hard
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.520]   I'll tell you what because they didn't get to walk
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.400]   They didn't even have classes for the last half of the year. He's going to stanford in the fall
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.800]   So I can congratulate just all the all of the winners 350
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.160]   Winners, that's really that's really fantastic and
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.200]   I'm excited about WWDC now we talked last week Alex you weren't here
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.960]   So I'll let you if you have anything to say we'd spend a long time talking about arm
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.480]   Because I think the most in there's going to be a lot of interesting stuff
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:34.960]   I'm really curious what they're going to do with ipad o s because i'm starting to really love the magic keyboard ipad combination
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.760]   I'm very feel like this is the computer you have always wanted
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.200]   But I think we're most interested at least I am in the arm transition
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.080]   And i'm sure Alex you might have some thoughts we talked about this
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.760]   We're at no way me. I mean I who wasn't here? Andy wasn't here
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.280]   Andy what were you?
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.440]   Andy needs to talk about it. Yes your chance
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.720]   Let it out mostly mostly it's that
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:02.800]   I hope that I hope that it's not going to be a gentle transition for anybody who writes off or creates hardware
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:09.040]   Um, it's I hope that it's a gentle transition. I hope it's the the sort of thing where apple realizes that
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.800]   The first people who are going to adopt this are going to be kind of like
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:18.240]   I think it's going to be kind of like what how the macbook air rolled out where it was a
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.720]   almost unusable computer
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.120]   except for the people that
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:30.560]   Specifically wanted and lusted after the lightest and thinnest mac that ever or laptop that ever existed
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.360]   They were they were willing to suffer along with a really slow cpu that spins the spins the fans up
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.840]   They're willing to suffer with just one usb port
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.520]   Uh, but the fact that they could it was the size of a magazine
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.040]   That was worth the money to them. It was worth all the all the suffering
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.320]   So, um, I think that the the analog for that is going to be a mac book nothing sized
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.680]   Mac that runs on arm for people who
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.920]   They don't care that
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:01.120]   Maybe this won't support thunderbolt right away and maybe it's going to be limited to
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.600]   Almost like an ios range of software to begin with
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.320]   but the idea of having a
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:15.520]   A macbook that runs for 18 hours on battery and is as thin as a as a as a macbook
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.920]   Nothing and also can do some special tricks because of the intimacy between
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.400]   Uh a custom designed
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.520]   Cpu and the rest of the hardware designed around it. That's going to be enough of a cell for them to go for it
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.720]   um
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.160]   I don't
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:36.080]   I'm still curious to find out how long it would take for them to create a custom arm that could
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:43.680]   Create like an iMac or even a mac mini powered computer or a a mac that is powerful enough to satisfy people who?
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:50.080]   Would be buying a regular macbook pro or a mac mini, uh or a mac pro, uh today
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.120]   I am I I I wonder how long it'll take for them to do that
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.600]   This is there are a lot of things that are non trivial about it
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:03.360]   Uh including including how do you interpret how do you make sure that these things?
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.520]   Uh
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.880]   Can use things like thunderbolt? How do you do think how do you?
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.800]   How do you uh incorporate technologies that were developed by intel that you get for free
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:18.240]   On top of any intel chip and so a lot of these things are going to be real
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.720]   Real it's it's like digging up the lawn and and checking out your sewer pipes
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.760]   A lot of stuff is going to have to be re hooked up. There's going to be a lot of pain in this transition
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.920]   I just hope that they
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:35.360]   Uh, they limit the pain to people who have signed up for that pain as opposed to saying guess what
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   Nothing works anymore and it's not going to get any better for anyone for at least seven years. You're welcome
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.080]   Uh, but but it but it is exciting. I I what I what I said on twitter a
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   Week ago or two weeks ago
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.680]   Was that so long as there are benefits for the user in the form of for instance
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.760]   They're able to make a super powerful Mac that cost only a thousand bucks
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.920]   Like a the two thousand dollar Mac now cost only a thousand bucks or they have
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:09.440]   Uh, I'll be able to because they're able to create a cpu in harmony with all the other hardware inside that machine
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.360]   That's also in harmony with the os that's also in harmony
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.960]   Uh, with xcode means that this hardware can do things that no windows machine can possibly achieve
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.480]   Simply because apple is really is designing everything from top to bottom
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.040]   all the way to uh, a
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.040]   Being able to have again 18 or 20 hours of battery life because they can design they can really really tune the cpu
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.400]   To exactly what it needs to do inside this machine if all
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:41.600]   What i'm looking at is that if it's uh, solving problems for consumers if there's a benefit to consumers
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.800]   This is wonderful if all they're doing is solving problems for apple and allowing
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.680]   Allowing their user base to be in a position where well, sorry
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.560]   Sorry, sorry if you bought a mac an intel based mac this year
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.760]   Because instead of being able to use it still 10 years from now. It's going to be effectively dead five years from now
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:05.200]   That is we're not in the position of we're not here to help out apple. We're here to help out ourselves
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.920]   That's why we put down our money for max, but there's such a huge opportunity here
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.440]   So much so much bigger than the opportunities that were presented when
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:19.200]   They transitioned from power pc to intel that it's it's it's wonderful to imagine
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.720]   What uh what an entry level mac could be like five years from now
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:28.160]   They you know, I actually hope they do it quickly they they have there's two examples
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.720]   They did it very quickly to intel in less than a year
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.480]   They took a
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.720]   Dam long time moving from 68 000 to a power pc
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.880]   And I think they've taken a really long time more than five years in this 32-bit transition and I think the
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.520]   it's clear
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:50.240]   That the 32-bit transition took too long the people dragged their feet and as a result
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.960]   There are a lot of 32-bit apps that didn't get updated. They said how we got time we got time. Oops
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.040]   So i'm hoping that they do it more like the one-year transition
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.160]   I know the the big reason they won't is because they just released a mac pro
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.840]   And uh, that's but that's a commercial consideration
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.920]   But it's commercial considerations aside. I think they could I think they could do it all fast and I'm sure
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:21.200]   You guys correct me. Is there anything about this architecture the a 12 a 13 a 1000 architecture?
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.600]   That means it couldn't be every bit as fast as a zion or as powerful as a zion
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   As you said they can customize it for their heart their needs
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.840]   Whether it is out of the gate, um, I think that they have the opportunity to do that
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.720]   I think that we're there's a lot of a lot of speed available to that
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.880]   And I think that they don't have to do it out of the gate either
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.400]   I mean, I I don't know
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:46.720]   I know that there's no there's no there's no like limit in big, you know, a risk processor or a low
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.160]   I mean we've seen arms as low power risk processors
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.840]   But there's no
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:57.280]   That doesn't mean they can't be as fast as they want to be right or as in fact I wouldn't be surprised
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.600]   Forget 10 core
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.920]   I would be surprised the next Mac Pro 64 core 128 core or more
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:10.000]   I mean, I think that the big advantage of owning all the hardware development is that you can really plan a lot of things to work together
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.040]   You know and in a way that is hard. You don't have to expose
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:20.720]   It gives them a lot more freedom to to build the apps and build the the o s so that it fully takes advantage of every
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.160]   So there's a there's a little bit of how fast is the processor and there's also how much of the processor
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:32.400]   Does the o s take advantage of and so I think that there's both of those things could end up being a snappier experience
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.160]   I don't I mean I think that if if apple releases one piece of hardware
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:41.360]   Uh this year that is using that I mean one piece of like a traditional Mac
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.600]   This year that that uses arm. I think that's aggressive
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.720]   I think that if they get all the way to arm on all the machines in five years, I think that would be aggressive
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.320]   Well, we don't know I'm not saying they won't do it. Well, we don't know is right in the lab right now
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.320]   They've been working on this probably for years
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.600]   Yeah, and there's been rumors about arm processors on mac for a couple of days
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.520]   They probably have a mac pro equivalent machine in the lab, right? Why wouldn't they?
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.920]   But but again, I you know the easiest thing to do would be to tell developers
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.840]   Hey in a year we're gonna start releasing this this hardware and you need to take advantage of it
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.280]   That's the issues developers and that's why you do fast because they are lazy
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.720]   As well as we know from the 32 to 6 but it's not like
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:27.200]   But again in a year we're gonna do we're gonna release some of the I don't I think that the pro ones will not happen that fast
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.520]   I think they'll take three to five years to get to the pro
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.520]   Machines
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.120]   There's just a lot more complexity there and there's a lot of apps that are a lot harder to update
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:41.520]   It's one thing to update a business app that is not fully utilizing the hardware and it's it also for those business apps
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.840]   It's easier to run them in in some version of emulation without the user feeling there is some
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.400]   Apple doesn't care about the third party apps
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.360]   So I'm gonna say it's gonna be
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:56.880]   Faster than you think I bet there's a very fast mac ish mac pro ish
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:04.960]   Device that is running arm final cut arm logic like our apples own pro apps. What do they care about the others?
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.480]   They don't care they thumb their nose at adobe they do
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:14.480]   Uh, not really they give adobe a lot of warning and when adobe drags his feet to some degree apples is okay
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.360]   We're gonna move forward
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.800]   But they've given a lot of time to adobe to get some some some of those things done and I think that there is a
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.360]   I mean apple is definitely
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.000]   Not you know, you can't
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.400]   You don't want to have another final cut 10
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.000]   You know kind of thing where you okay?
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.120]   We're all we're just gonna change and you end up with a lot of professionals
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.520]   You know throwing a lot of shade on you and I don't think that they need that and there's no reason for that
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.480]   I don't think that there's any reason for them to move any faster because they again
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.000]   It's a lot of complexity the easiest thing to do is test on again business typical business users
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.920]   Let them figure this stuff out while you're you can run that stuff in emulio
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.000]   You can run excel in emulation all day
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.600]   No one's gonna notice. Um, you can run a lot of the productivity apps all day with when no one's gonna notice
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.480]   Um, but I think that you start running photoshop my cinema 4d those types of of things
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.320]   Um people are going to start noticing the performance and I and I think that's all gpu bounds out more
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.840]   Some of them are some of them are but some of them are doing heavy processing and and again. I think that it's
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   um
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   Uh, I don't think apple
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.720]   Again, I don't think that they need to I think that the the big advantage
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.440]   That I see with arm is that you're gonna as a developer you're gonna be able to develop applications that run
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.920]   It's gonna be easier to run the catalyst type by op, you know situations where you're
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.840]   I'm gonna write an app that runs on them on the phone it runs on the ipad and it runs on the air
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:39.360]   Let's just say like that's the first place where that makes a lot of sense for the developer and for the user to have
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.080]   You know something that's gonna easily run and have a unified interface and theoretically
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.400]   I think that this is where we would probably see
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.360]   Laptops that you can have you can touch their screen
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.720]   So, you know, so so I think that this is where we're gonna probably see
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.640]   Um touch interfaces on the laptops is the arm based ones
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:01.600]   Um is where we're gonna see that where they're not gonna do it on the older the heavier machines
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.400]   But I I think that in three to five years and they get makes sense to unify the code base and unify the the hardware
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.480]   But I don't think they're gonna do it. I think that you're gonna give
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.800]   Developers a lot of warning. It's a big shift. There's no and there's no reason to go any faster
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:19.440]   And that's that's the kind of opportunity that I'm speaking of that even if apple is absolutely at absolutely sticks to a
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.200]   Stockmatic approach towards hey, there is no such thing as a touch screen on a mac
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.320]   Even if they just simply took the form factor of the ipad
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:34.480]   Created a macbook air or mac book helium something lighter than there that is super super thin super super long battery life
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.200]   Docs into a magic keyboard and is simply a
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:43.760]   Mac that could be docked into a magic keyboard when you're on the go and then pulled out of that then dropped into a desktop dock
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:49.200]   Uh like a like an old duo and give you a more more liberal array of ports
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:55.040]   That would be incredible because one of my as I'm sort of I am in the position right now where I
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.640]   Have to update a lot of things. I have to update my laptop right now
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.800]   I also have to update my desktop right now, which means that I'm really looking for a holistic
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:10.720]   Together all together sort of plan and if apple were to create a computer like that where I would have that sort of ultra portability that now
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.280]   I rely on for my with my ipad or with my my google pixel Chromebook
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.160]   Uh, but I could also use it for real mac stuff
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:23.280]   I wouldn't particularly care that buying that plus the magic keyboard would cost me $2 over $1,300
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.080]   It would be such a beautiful solution to that problem
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.240]   I wouldn't even care that it's an arm
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.160]   But the the difficulty is going to come when you have people who don't necessarily don't need something who needs something that is way above an ipad
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.560]   Way above essentially a chrome book with a v8 on it
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.440]   You have to there are people who use excel to run really really complex models
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.600]   And the difference between needing 30 seconds and running needing five seconds is a really really big deal
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.920]   And the the the thing that I fear is that apple is going to create a new platform
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.240]   That is going to be great for
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:04.480]   Not even 80 or 90 percent of the users, but great for only 80 or 90 percent of what people do
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:11.680]   And all of a sudden uh 10 percent of what you do on a mac is going to be utter hell for at least three or four or five years
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.760]   And I hope that's not the result, but it's a really complicated
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.200]   Transition they're they're they're planning here and their then their goal is going to be to make sure that the users don't notice
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.440]   As much of a difference at all
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:31.200]   Well, I yeah, all right, we'll see I think there's probably no technical reason they couldn't do it faster
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.560]   It really comes down to market considerations. They have I don't think they'll ever do touch on a desktop
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.440]   I think that they want to keep touch on the ipad
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:44.640]   Because that's where it properly belongs. They're making the ipad more and more of a computing system
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.960]   I expect them to put a lot of energy into iOS and ipad o s
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:55.680]   Uh, and the mac is why they're going to be for pros, uh, which means they don't have to move along that fast, but I think there's some
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.840]   I think there's some
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:03.040]   Advantage to using momentum and moving quickly. They also are not happy with intel
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:09.040]   And I don't know I don't think they want to do one more day making computers around intels crappy chips
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:14.400]   Yeah, I think that I just think that the for the heavier pro apps. It's going to be a big lift
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.720]   And it's gonna take a long time and I rewrite those you think yeah, yeah, it's going to be really hard
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.080]   And so and they and and for the lot of these pro apps you can't
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.720]   Uh
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.160]   Uh, it's going to be hard to emulate them as well to instill get the performance
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:32.560]   You can't for instance. You can't really run a lot of these apps in parallels or in right, you know
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:36.800]   Those types of things because and so that emulation isn't isn't going to be a great experience for the user
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.360]   So I think that that's going to take a little bit of time
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.400]   But I do think that um over the next year of having an air
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.960]   Able to do a lot of those things. I think makes sense. I'm also really interested in seeing AR. I'm interested in
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:52.240]   I'm I mean the thing that I'm most excited about and I think it could largely be something that
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:56.080]   I see what's possible and I'm hoping that they do it as opposed to
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:01.760]   Knowing whether they're going to do it or not and and that's really I think I think that USD Z is the most exciting thing that
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.760]   Apple's working on and it could change
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:09.600]   Many many things um, you know, we've been talking about a unified 3d platform to deliver
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:17.200]   Assets for two decades at least, you know, and and so the if they actually get to a point where they can reach critical mass
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.800]   And that means the the possibility of having a media container
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:27.680]   That is a 3d model. So I want to add something as a developer or if I want to add or and as a user
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.840]   I want to add something that being able to add a 3d model to your page's document or your keynote document or your word document
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.320]   um as easy as you can um
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.760]   Add it to as a movie or a still or anything else, you know, that's what the possibility of 3d
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.360]   USD Z is
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:49.680]   Is that it's the o s is taking taking all that conversion and all that display and it was we saw bits of that in quick draw 3d
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.600]   A long time ago inside a quick time, but that all went away as quick time was gutted
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.760]   You know and so the the possibility of having USD Z as as this format if you can imagine
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.960]   And then if you combine that with the lidar that we've only
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.280]   People barely understand what that lidars for um, so it doesn't make sense yet
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:12.480]   So hopefully WWC is going to make sense of that for us to some degree of um, you know
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.120]   All the things that you know being able to do seeing
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.760]   Not only seeing capture but asset capture
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:23.280]   So I have an object that I want to put as a 3d object into my page's document or in my keynote
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.640]   That I want to be able to rotate around what if I could just pick up my iPad and
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.280]   Rotate that object in front of my iPad real quickly and have a 3d model and then pop it into my keynote
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.200]   And be able to rotate it around as I show it to folks and that's not science fiction
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:40.000]   That is the kind of thing that that could be very well possible or email someone a 3d model
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.760]   You know after I shot it with my iPad or you know eventually other hardware and so so I think that there's um
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:51.040]   There's a lot of opportunity there that to just change the way we think about a lot of documents
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:57.840]   I think that as we see, you know a lot of iBooks flowing into into um pages
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:06.480]   You know there's a lot of opportunity to build really interesting documents that right now lowest common denominator solutions like pdf and and ebooks have not been able to
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.080]   um really capture that apple could still I think
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:16.400]   I never thought I would say that 10 years after they figured they started they might actually come back to it and be able to redefine
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.880]   You saw that they're killing iBooks
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.480]   Yeah, yeah, but page it's because pages has almost every
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:27.280]   Yeah, yeah, you doesn't i'm actually hotter about them killing iTunes you that one
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.160]   Peaves me
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.200]   But that's not for them. Yeah, so i'm gonna have so yeah
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:38.160]   So, but I think that there's there's there's opportunities there to to really change the way we we learn
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:45.120]   And the way we send stuff to people I wonder if apples worried about blurring the lines between the ipad os and macos
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.440]   I think they're encouraging it. They want it to blur. Yeah, I think they need to spur
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.800]   Yeah, so that ultimately they'd be one platform
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:59.280]   Is there a no no not not ultimately one platform, but to make make a less messy platform
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:06.320]   Pair of platforms for themselves. They want they I think that it ultimately they want the the ipad the iphone and a mac
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.920]   To go together about as well as an iphone and an apple watch
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:16.240]   They they want these things to be considered to be almost the same device with the same experiences between the two
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.320]   even if the
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:24.800]   Operating systems that underlying underlying each of them has certain things that the that is optimized for one task and not the other
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.840]   So I I would be very very surprised if they ever
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:34.240]   Consolided down into mac ios mac os a Greek name mquah
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:39.680]   For an of greek yogurt, but I do think that we're going to see more constrictions
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.240]   Restrictions being put on what you can do on a mac
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:50.240]   With the perceived benefit being that your mac will work more intimately with your with your ipad and the experience
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:55.920]   Of one is going to be easier to transfer to the other. There's a interesting post
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.360]   from famed apple leaker fudge
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:06.880]   On reddit he actually tweeted the arm mac book future is coming maybe sooner than people expect
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.080]   But his timeline actually is fairly slow. He says
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:15.440]   Four stages. I don't know if he knows anything or he's just predicting starting around
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:25.760]   Well, this says 2015. Oh, I guess he means it's already started because we've been in it. Yeah, we're already in it. Yeah, uh, release of the t1 chip
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.000]   Map books then the t2 chip mac books
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.920]   Release of at least one lower end arm mac book that would be maybe this year or next and then transitioning the full
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:42.560]   Line up to arm around 2023 to 2025. So he also is talking a three to five year
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:48.800]   And it's not saying anything we actually all have it all said in in some form or fashion. So
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.440]   Um, it's it's a long read but maybe worth reading to clarify
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.520]   And I think I think that's that's the pace that it would make the most sense
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.400]   I mean, whether he's right or not. I think the three to five year
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:06.720]   pace of you know constantly updating those things and giving developers plenty of time to to work on their development and
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:12.560]   And selling it. I mean, it's a this is a huge. It's only happened on the mac platform a couple times and so
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:20.240]   Um, so it's it's a big jump that needs to be done very carefully and I think arguably a bigger jump than power pc
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.880]   Motorroll at a power pc
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.240]   Maybe the same size as power pc to intel, which by the way we happened
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.880]   Within a year that happened really quickly
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:34.560]   That was the hardware. This is moving the yo-wap. I mean, yeah, it is. Yeah, and this is really changing the os
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.440]   You know completely so it's really moving from the mac os to to um to
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:45.680]   Yeah, that's that's what I was going to say too. Uh, it really is absolutely that fundamental
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.720]   More than moving to intel was
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:53.680]   I would say so I mean, it like I do think this is going to be a painful one
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.640]   And I don't it's it's also going to be really really difficult for again people like me that
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:03.120]   Uh, they're just it kind of sucks to be in a position where you feel as though
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:11.040]   Naturally, it's time for me to spend several thousand dollars on a new desktop. Yeah, you don't want to do it necessarily knowing
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.240]   Yeah, I at least want to hold off for at least a year to see
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:19.360]   What their timetable is and if it's if it's going to be as painful well, you might know monday they might
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:26.800]   Know it. Yeah, maybe they'll make it really clear what their table is and like say it's a risk by 2025
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.960]   We will have all
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.920]   Max on arm the other side of this is this careful because this is the risk of osboarding yourself too, right?
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.280]   If you say yeah, we're gonna have we're gonna have it'll be two years
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.360]   We'll have mac then in arm and then and he's not gonna buy a computer for two years
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:46.000]   I don't think that apple suffers from that though because if that were true
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.800]   Every single year people wouldn't buy a new mac because they're waiting for the next one
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.880]   So I don't think apple fits in that same
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.200]   Ideology, you know, we had some of the pressure max all the time
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:03.280]   Right the pressure is a little lower as well because of the amount of apples revenue that's based on their
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.720]   The mac, you know, it's just it's they can
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:12.000]   Do this with a little less risk because it's a pretty small percentage of their of their income
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.960]   It was the only guess they who brought up the osborn effectiveness monday note
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:23.200]   Um, and that is you know, but I think you're right. I think lori you're right that apple is not as sensitive to that as other
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.200]   PC manufacturers. I mean, it's good. It's a good thing to wonder but
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.640]   You know, that's the same thing is, you know, will the iphone
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:37.440]   10r cannibalize the iphone 10 lineup will clearly it didn't so like there every time
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:43.840]   You use like sort of market standards for what you think apple does wrong they seem to overcome that and and
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:49.840]   They just fit in a different in a different world and when it comes to tech and what we what we don't know
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:55.360]   You're absolutely you're absolutely the other the other risk that apple is falling into though is that and again
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.000]   I'm using myself as an example here that I
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:03.120]   I'm no longer in the world where I have to buy one computer to do everything for me
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:07.280]   And so as i'm considering what do I want to do for my mobile solution?
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.360]   What do I want to do for my desktop solution?
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.120]   What do I want to do for my ultra mobile solution?
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:17.120]   Part of it is that if apple is if there's this much if there's a lot if i'm left with a lot of confusion about
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:26.480]   When i'll be able to buy a desktop class like a pro a powerful grade desktop Macintosh for my photoshop work for video editing work for any
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:33.520]   3d modeling work i might want to do i might decide that well, let's at least throw windows 10 devices like an amd
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.840]   cpu device
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.760]   desktop into the into the mix because i've already long ago
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:45.680]   Sort of switched ever since apple pulled aperture from under me that was like, okay
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:51.440]   Well, now i sort of have to use lightroom because it's the only thing that will do an aperture sort of thing for me
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:55.120]   Which means that now i'm using lightroom and photoshop no problem moving there
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:59.760]   I'm already using like an open source video editor that runs on any platform i want
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:07.200]   The modeling program again any any platform i want so i'm actually for the for the super powerful desktop solution
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.560]   I'm perfectly free to move to windows if i want to i don't want to
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.960]   But if i do want something that's going to last me five six seven eight nine years
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.080]   Unless apple really explains to me as a consumer
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:23.760]   Here is if you need if you need a good iMac pro or a like a two thousand dollar
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:28.480]   Outfitted uh Mac mini here is the day that you're going to be able to buy an amd
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.760]   processor back machine with those kind of specs
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:38.800]   Steven sanovsky who has a checkered reputation since he was the author at microsoft of windows eight
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.040]   And left after that the back hole
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:48.240]   But he also has some experience with operating systems and porting and all that stuff
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.440]   He actually says an interesting thing it was a
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:56.640]   Long tweet storm, but he said the real conundrum is do you keep cocoa?
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:00.800]   And the cocoa apis at all do you keep macos at all?
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:06.080]   Do you do you say that he says the cocoa apis are already at end of life
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.360]   Any vendor with the cocoa app is already focused on some combination of iOS in the cloud
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   And it's essentially milking their existing mac apps as part of a larger service
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:20.480]   I don't know if that's true certainly not true for a well, maybe it is for adobe you think it is
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.640]   Uh, he says that's very similar to win 32 the situation we had eight years ago
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.040]   The cost to a big
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:30.320]   Isv to move an existing cocoa app to ios is well known
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:36.720]   Now cocoa and ios are close, but then there's all those pesky things like the interaction model background processing over on design of the app
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.120]   And of course keyboard and mouse so the challenge
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:46.960]   He thinks is do you abandon macos in effect? Are you saying we're going to do something new and it's not cocoa in which case?
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:52.560]   Alex you're absolutely right that's a that is an even that's a much bigger move than the hardware move
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:59.200]   And I think that I think it's coming I mean I think again when we look at a three to five year turn that could have five years down the road
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.520]   I think that you're on a unified off, you know, which we
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.640]   Some of us have been saying for get go. I mean they're gonna move they're gonna unify
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.400]   You know all of these this operating system eventually whether it
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:14.080]   How long it takes to get there is the question, but not whether they're gonna do it
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.680]   It doesn't make sense to keep on supporting multiple platforms over time
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:23.760]   But it's just a matter of giving developers enough time to well, I guess I would say either give developers enough time to
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.360]   Sort it out or make sure that the same services are
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:35.040]   Available on that platform. So I mean like for instance, I as an as an like as an example affinity photo
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:39.920]   You know is not photoshop, but it's approach. It's you know, I use
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:43.040]   I use affinity photo
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.720]   80 percent of the time now
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.160]   As opposed to photoshop and I started using photoshop almost 30 years ago
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:53.200]   That's really interesting. Wow, you know, and so I you know, it's just faster and quicker and and I can have it on more machines
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:58.160]   And I don't use it on iOS right you're not using it on mac. No, no, I use it on the mac. Oh, you do. Oh, okay
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:04.080]   But it's but it's gonna port really easily whereas photoshoot getting photoshop over could take a lot is a lot more weight
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.640]   And and so
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.480]   Starting for stretch is easier, isn't it?
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:13.840]   It is it is and that's the advantage that I mean, that's the advantage for instance that final cut has is that
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:20.160]   It doesn't have a lot of old code, you know, it's and it's now gotten to a point where it's pretty mature and it's a lot
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:25.920]   Uh more modern than than the other than its competitors and so it'll be able to kind of move along with this
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.920]   Be sad for that
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:33.360]   One reason but that's just my use case which is that macOS is essentially a Unix
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:37.680]   And I will miss that but I don't think that there's much room for the command line or Unix
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.800]   Apps in an armed world. Maybe they're you need
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:44.000]   No, well, it's remember that OS 10 is OS 10 everywhere
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:50.880]   Uh and now iOS has OS 10 at its core. We just have never had a terminal for it and would be it would be
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.920]   a
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.760]   significant step
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:01.440]   I mean in terms of announcing what the future of the back is if apple suddenly said no, you don't get to have a terminal
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:07.760]   Yeah, that would be really sad. Yeah, and so and Alex with with respect
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.560]   My friend my brother from another mother
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:16.800]   Uh, you you have been predicting for a long time that there's going to be unification of uh of macOS and iOS
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.800]   Uh, you might be right, but you can also predict that one day
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.680]   North america and south america will be separate continents and eventually you will be right about that as well
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.760]   I just I think that for the for the foreseeable future
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:36.400]   There is no there is no advantage to separate land masses. They obviously are separate continents. Oh, i'm sorry
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:42.160]   Right, no, but your point is excellent plate tic tonics is in Alex's favor
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.640]   Exactly
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:51.040]   The law of entropy means that at some point we will all be running the same operating system because we're all to be it's all going to be the same temperature
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.040]   It's great good
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.640]   fundamentally it never makes sense getting it is what all i'm getting it is that
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.280]   There is always going to be a distinction between the sort of app that you're running a phone and on an ipad
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:08.080]   And the sort of thing that you sit down at a desk in order to use certainly but that doesn't mean you need different operating systems to do that
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.720]   Well, we're just different interfaces
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:17.680]   Well, that's what we have right now. We all hope we all have that's right. Why would we underneath our nithola device all our advice
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.960]   iOS has extra things that the Mac doesn't need the Mac OS has extra things that iOS has doesn't need
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:30.240]   Including like a big big pile of io think about how few devices that an iOS device can actually connect with versus a
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.640]   Mac book and connected just about everything
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.120]   I just I just don't see the advantage for apple to say that oh by the way your view bought
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.960]   You've just bought a copy of again, whatever really great photo editing app realize that it's going to look and work
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.960]   Very very differently on this device than it is on this other device
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:54.000]   Why why claim that they're the exact same devices if you're going to give people two really really big experiences
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.080]   And why how can you create a version of ios that works as well on
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.920]   A 4k screen and two other screens next to it
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:07.840]   As it will be expected to run on ios running on a little 5.7 and screen. I just don't see it
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.120]   But I think that the thing is is that there's there's essentially
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:17.360]   You know four os is right or whether there may be more but there there's four major os's and three of them are all
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.600]   Some some version of ios right so you've got ipad iphone tv
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.920]   Oh, i'm sorry and watch so there's five so there those are those are all ios that all
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.080]   Have different things that can't they can't and can't do the only one left out is mac
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:36.400]   You know so the thing is is that they all you can't run what you know the watch and the tv and the ios and
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.720]   iPad are all there are apps on the iphone that won't run on the ipad
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   There's apps on the ipad that won't run on the iphone
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.240]   So it's not but they but they are much more unified codebase than mac
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.880]   You know so mac is that one that's left out that is very different than the other four
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.040]   So it doesn't it it makes sense at some point to drag that one
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.160]   You know into the fold, you know and and so I think that the trajectory
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:04.080]   Isn't new. I think I will argue the trajectory to go that direction is probably at least 10 years old
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.680]   You know so um, you know to move into that and so
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:11.120]   But it's just that it takes an enormous amount of lift to
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:17.760]   To get all the you know all the planets to align to move that over and I think we're I think next week
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.000]   We're going to see the more external step towards that towards that process
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.120]   Okay, I I just disagree
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.440]   And that's all we have to say. Oh, we're gonna find out
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.240]   And in about six years one of you is going to buy the other alopster dinner
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.960]   I
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.520]   Can afford a clam cakes and a bowl of
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.480]   Go ahead larry
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.400]   The question that comes to my mind is what would an iOS on a mac look like because what we're
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.480]   What we're envisioning right now is something that's like what we see on our ipad
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:00.320]   But instead it's on our mac which is absolutely untenable like that you can't have
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.800]   your desktop experience be the kind of things where you know you have
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.840]   icons on your home screen instead of just you know documents that you can drag and drop there or
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.240]   um, you know different things like that, but
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.040]   I guess a lot of it depends on what it means to transition
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.840]   Mac OS to iOS or
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:26.240]   Obviously there'd be like a some sort of different separate naming scheme that wouldn't be iOS because it's iPhone and ipad
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.360]   but
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.240]   if if apple were able to like integrate
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.800]   the iOS operating system into mac but keep
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.240]   everything that's familiar and
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:47.520]   comfortable about using a desktop because the the biggest problem with with turning your mac into an iOS device is that
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.440]   You can't run it the same way and there are just too many
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:55.520]   Things that we need to do on our desktop computers that you can't do
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.080]   On an iPhone or an ipad so in today's what we have today
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.880]   Absolutely couldn't be done on a mac
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.840]   but maybe if there's a way that their
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:13.600]   Their future combinations could meld in some of iOS with some of mac OS and this is just in yet another
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.120]   iOS operating system that has a lot of extra features just like what you're talking about
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:24.960]   I still I still think i'm on and i think i'm with this i still don't think this is going to happen
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:32.400]   I think that the the issue is is that you know when you see mice you know mice and keyboards being supported so freely on the on the
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.120]   You know the ipad them those
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:42.400]   Appearing now provide app developers with a new way of interacting with folks that wasn't available when it was touched
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.080]   So a lot of this stuff doesn't make sense when you don't have those when you start having those
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.600]   A lot of things start to make more sense, you know like omnigraphy
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.920]   I can't use on the ipad like I can't do it with touch
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.680]   You know i'm now going to start i've been starting to experiment with it. I use it all a lot
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.080]   Omnigraphy a lot on the mac
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.200]   Um, the ipad one has not been a usable experience for me
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.480]   And and so i'm now starting to experiment with it with the
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.560]   the
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.480]   Mouse I wanted to work on the mouse. It's just that now it needs to be updated so that it works really well with the mouse
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.040]   So, so you know so as we start to have
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:20.000]   Um apps get updated to take advantage of some of the new tools that apple's giving them we start really closing the gap between those two operating systems
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.320]   Um, you know where you know the ipad's going to be able to do more the and you know in many ways the macOS will be able to do more
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.400]   But I don't think that you know I again I don't
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:34.240]   I don't think it's going to happen tomorrow, but I I think that there's some point where the macOS doesn't make any sense anymore
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.760]   We may call that but it's going to look it's just going to be another flavor again. It's not
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:46.080]   It will still be distinct. It will still have its own tools and its own display systems and probably some of its own libraries
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.720]   But I think that it's all they're all going to be part of the same
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.920]   Family, you know in the in within I would I would guess within five years
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.680]   They'll be a problem for our bumblebee overlords. I think
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:07.520]   Uh is that coming soon by the way, whatever happened to the killer the killer get the murder was soon enough. Whatever happened to those
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.160]   What did they want? They went to murder
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   Oh dude
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.960]   I hate it. We're good. We're good here. I hate it when they they start something in an episode
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:22.960]   And then they just drop it before the season ender. It's crazy. We got a marvel movie
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:26.480]   MURM murder wasps
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.520]   Uh
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:33.680]   Some updates to the hard where the apple 16 inch macbook pro gets the new radion
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.400]   Pro 5600m
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.960]   Is that good Alex? I don't know
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.880]   Still not an invidia. Yeah, still not an invidia. Oh my god
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.760]   Everything everything an apple does in that area. I just look at it like well, it's not an invidia card apple
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:51.840]   Whatever they want to do is now offering user installable mac pro
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:59.840]   I misread this at first. I thought it was iMac pro, but no mac pro SSD kits up to eight terabytes for 2800 bucks
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:07.360]   Uh my little they're gonna get little minor things out of the way as they prepare for a monday
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.760]   I think as as often as the case with apple
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.800]   They did also confirm the rumor that you were going to be able to get 0%
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.400]   financing on your apple card plus 3 cash back
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.360]   On a number of apple products
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.600]   Which I do think is interesting leading up to wwdc because we kind of always assume that you
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:32.080]   Won't be buying anything from wwdc and every once in a while they'll do something like a new version of a mac or you know
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.080]   home pod or something like that, but
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.480]   Putting this offer out right before wwc it makes me think
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.920]   Me too me too
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.240]   I uh
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.520]   I didn't realize this but my iMac pro is almost three years old now
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.440]   Honey
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.440]   Hint hint hint
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.000]   Damn it. I bought that trigger grill instead damn it
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:07.200]   Uh, my my iMac my basic iMac it's not an iMac pro. It's more than five years old and it runs super great
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.400]   But I know yep
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:15.120]   I'm i'm ready if there's a new design if there's you know, like mostly bezel-less screen or something like that
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.120]   I am ready to upgrade it's fine
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.000]   This is exactly why apple doesn't have to worry about the otsport
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.360]   Right, right. What do you got? We'll take it
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.480]   Yeah, yeah, I love the fact i'm so I was streaming to you right now from a 2012 mac mini
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.480]   Uh, and yes, it's an i7 with lots of with lots of horsepower behind it
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.880]   But the fact that it's a perfectly usable machine
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:41.920]   Even eight years later is a real testament to what apple does so i'm i'd be more than happy to buy another apple desktop
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:45.680]   I like the design language we've seen and by the way
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:51.440]   It's a little more confirmed now because I think there's some icons in ios 14 as well with his bezel-less
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.640]   uh iMac or small bezel iMac so
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.520]   I like I mean, I think xdr would be cool on an iMac
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.160]   Really?
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.680]   Could it make it less i need it to be reasonably priced still
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.240]   Yeah, the iMac pro is very expensive actually I love my iMac pro and i
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:15.440]   I'm not anxious to change it. I don't feel like it's any slower or anything, but uh
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.560]   although now that I have
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:25.600]   Kind of zoom and big blue button and all that crap install on and I just want to wipe the drive off and start over
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.440]   I can't wait till covid's over because so I could throw out zoom
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.320]   But come on my god first thank god for coming on your shoe fries. Yeah. Yeah, oh
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.800]   aika vanga
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:43.920]   All right, I think we're gonna see a new iMac. Well, we soon knew apple tv on monday
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.040]   I you know
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:53.040]   I would have thought that if they were going to put out a new apple tv like a something big and different
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.600]   It was gonna happen last fall or last march when when they talked about
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.240]   You know all the new stuff coming to tv plus and they didn't do it last year
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:06.640]   So I think if we see anything it's just gonna be a refresh
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.800]   It's you know slightly faster processor blah blah blah little boring stuff. It's not going to be a complete overhaul
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.240]   What about a developer?
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.120]   kit with arm in it
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.760]   Some special that is
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:29.040]   Absolutely possible in fact some of the rumors that of coming out about the new iMac that's that may or may not happen
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.560]   one of the possibilities is that it's a
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.360]   arm mac for developers that's
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.160]   A dual processor something
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:45.120]   It's definitely a possibility and if that's the if that's the case we didn't we won't get that new iMac with the pretty bezels this year
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:51.680]   Right. All right. I do think a mac a mac mini that was just that that ran on arm would be incredibly useful for developers
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.080]   You know just that like right we're not gonna promise anything. We're just releasing this it's got arm
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:01.760]   You can start working on it. You know that gives you a computer, you know a base state to you know more a um
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:07.040]   Reference, you know to start working again. There's a precedent really I'll go that before right? Yeah
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:13.760]   Yeah, but for the if the intel transition they basically they seeded a lot of developers with intel based max
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.480]   The first time I used one as my effect was at the mac hack conference. It was in a power during the
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.360]   Yeah, as in the power mac case and there was a thousand bucks and you had to send it back. I'm reading the john groover
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.280]   Story about it. You had to send it back by the end of 2006
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.600]   But then you got a first generation until iMac in return
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.320]   Um, so that that's they did that with the intel transition
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:43.040]   Could they could they do it with virtualization on an apple server?
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.080]   Do you think that for as a method of testing?
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.480]   Could you uh when connect connect code build it and then run it
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.000]   uh
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.120]   Remotely on a locally virtualized machine that's actually running on an apple server somewhere. I think so
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.880]   Absolutely, we're seeing that we're seeing. I mean look if you can play
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.960]   high quality high frame a video games office server
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.080]   See no reason why you couldn't do mac
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:11.040]   Arm and that's that's what from what Alex said
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:16.480]   What I would love to see is I already talked about one dream arm mac being a thin tablet
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.040]   Even if it's not nullity touch just the ability to have the super light super mac book helium
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.960]   Would be would be a big win if apple because of the thermal profile of lower thermal
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:34.080]   Thermal profile of an arm processor if they could put a mac nano inside an apple tv size box
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.800]   And reduce the price further
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.280]   It would be if they could find a way to get back to I think that wasn't the lowest price for a mac
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.760]   Many originally 500 or am I think it started for 99? I think you're right. Yeah, yeah
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.160]   And they could create one that is still
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.720]   Wonderful usable for games. Wonderful usable for what most uh home you
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.760]   Let's say 80 percent of what the most mac users would want to do
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.240]   And as a second mac or as a starter mac, uh, that would be a hell of a product
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.520]   I don't know if apple would be willing to sabotage their higher price points for it
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:11.600]   But that would be such a super interesting product, especially in a world where you can buy pretty good
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.240]   Intel machines for nooks for about two or three or four hundred dollars. I mean that
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.400]   The current yeah
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.400]   Absolutely the current uh apple tv has plenty of power to do a lot
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.800]   That the average person is to do on a day-to-day basis if they if they put that out there
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.880]   I could see a lot of people doing it
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.720]   Especially especially if they locked it to the app store if they said that there is absolutely no way you can run unsigned apps on this
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.800]   Everything you rerun half
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:42.720]   You have to be access through the app store and apple now has let's say a year from now even tighter restrictions
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:49.600]   That makes sure that the apis that everyone is using are optimized for what apple for c perceives as the future
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.400]   That again, that could be a super super hot idea. I get yeah
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.320]   I think people I think you see people putting those little apple apple tv's everywhere
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.480]   If they were able to do that. I mean because that's what we use we use mac minis for little
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.880]   Like little servers and little things they do and and you know all kinds of you know glue
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.720]   And at two or three hundred dollar piece of glue would be amazing
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:16.720]   You know we would and I think that it would be a huge boom for for app developers even if it's all inside of a really interesting
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:22.720]   The app store it would be it'd be super exciting big difference you'd have to put in a more a lot more ram right
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:27.600]   Maybe I mean there's still a lot of assets. Yeah, those games
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:32.240]   Those games are going a lot on that machine. I mean there that I watch what my kids are playing
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.360]   They love apple arcade and so they I think they have almost all the games they're they're playing through and and they
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.840]   Uh, you know, those are pretty I look at it as someone who used to work on games like wow
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.840]   That's a lot to put into a little box
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:51.200]   I wonder how much of that actually is server side come to think of it because there's a certain it's so obviously a lot of libraries
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.400]   Right that developers using because there's a certain common look
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:59.680]   Um, I want that's interesting question. How are they getting those games on that apple tv?
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.880]   server side you think
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:07.440]   They sneakily do the mixture. I think it's loading. I don't think I don't think it tries to hold the whole you know
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.160]   Um more than one level at a time. Well, that's for sure. You know, so I think that it's so I think that it can it can
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.560]   It definitely a lot that I don't think it's doing really server size gaming like
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:23.520]   Um, like google is I think it's still a loading asset. You know what this arm transition is going to be the end of bootcamp
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.120]   Yeah, true, right
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:31.680]   People are actually using it though now. Well, that's a good question. I mean they'd had to do bootcamp before
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.840]   Right now that I don't know if they do and windows on arm. I think it's probably awful
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:42.960]   I think that I'd be surprised if that's the other you can run windows on on arm. Yeah, not just bootcamp
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.320]   I think it'd be well. I don't like ourselves. They actually have whoa
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.240]   Windows on arm, but it's so slow, but Chris is running on comp chips
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:56.160]   I don't know apple might be and also there's a huge expense in making sure all the drivers are updated and work
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.480]   on
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:04.320]   That the exactly yeah, it was it was a great value add for the intel transition because now you could sell
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.360]   Uh, you could people who wanted a macbook, but had to were only allowed to buy
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.200]   uh windows windows laptop for work or they had that one instance which they had to use a use a macbook for work
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.200]   Uh, it was a great way to sell people a macbook that he couldn't sell before now
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.240]   I think people are just buying macbooks because they want macbooks
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:30.160]   Are show today brought to you by worldwide technology if you are a enterprise
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:38.400]   If you have technology are you in the cloud or you have enterprise security? Do you have enterprise servers and in on prem or in the cloud
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.680]   You probably know about ww t if you don't you really need to
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:48.880]   And you need to know about ww t's advanced technology centers started in one rack and one building 10 years ago
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:56.240]   It has grown into it's in multiple buildings now many many racks more than half a billion dollars of equipment
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.640]   The reason for the atc is they've got all the oem's in there
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:07.200]   So their engineers can spin up proofs of concept pilots learn how stuff works show how stuff interacts
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:14.320]   It's pretty darn cool half a billion dollars of equipment from hundreds of oem's and key partners
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:19.200]   ranging from heavyweights like net app and sisco and vmware to
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:24.080]   The emerging disruptors are changing everything like tanium and equinex and expanse
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:29.520]   It is we we visited it was actually the last trip before uh covid hit
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:36.000]   At least that I went out there in march early march and I was out there. I was amazing. That's like incredible
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.360]   Yeah
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.440]   They have a whole like note. It's like it's like they have the cloud in a in a little box
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.280]   A giant building. Yeah, so it's it's it is it was stunning to visit
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:53.760]   It was it's really neat that they think that way because you know and the other thing there were other things like
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.760]   They have distribution centers all over the world of course because they have their global company
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.080]   They're out of st louis, but they have customers all over the world
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.960]   But unlike other enterprise vendors
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.800]   They integrated all before they ship it to you so every I was watching the they have cameras
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.040]   You know on the on the fulfillment floors and I was watching I said what's that guy doing?
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.480]   He said oh, he's the carpenter every single distribution center has a full-time
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:24.400]   Carpenter in there building custom crates for shipping because when you buy from wwt
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.160]   They integrate it all they get all working and then they have a custom
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.560]   Special shock absorber crate. They ship it to you and so that all you do is open it up
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:38.400]   Plug it in it's good to go. It's little things like that that makes it's blow me away wwt
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:44.160]   Operates at a scale. I've never seen anything like it before they do everything
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.080]   app development analytics cloud services
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:52.880]   They're the best consultants in the world because they know everything and this a tc
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.480]   You're gonna want to be able to use it and by the way you can I'll explain that in a second
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.960]   They actually well I'll tell you now. Well, I'll keep it a secret
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.680]   They actually not only use it themselves for their proofs of concept and pilots
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.800]   They have created they started this last summer on demand
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.600]   Scheduleable labs
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.680]   That you can try
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:15.120]   24/7 from anywhere in the world. You don't have to come to st. Louis. Although
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.720]   If you do try the toasted ravioli, it's fantastic
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:24.320]   They have they have on-demand and schedulable labs like net app cloud volumes on tap
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.640]   They have on tap on flash net app disaster recovery as a service
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:34.320]   Hundreds of labs representing the newest advances and everything. I mean not just storage, but
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:40.000]   multi cloud hyper converged infrastructure cloud data management security
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:47.440]   This lab is a service is so cool. It's a dedicated lab space within the atc where you can perform your own programmatic testing
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:51.440]   And and that half billion dollars with equipment. It's all available to you
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:58.240]   And you can do it anywhere in the world. I think this is wonderful. This is what ww t's engineers use you can use it too
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:01.280]   And it's more than just labs. I mean this this
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.440]   platform
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:10.240]   Creates a multiplier effective knowledge speed and agility anytime anywhere around the world for ww t customers
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:16.640]   You get the labs, but you also get access to articles and case studies. You can actually go there right now ww t.com/twit
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.160]   And start learning ww t.com/twit
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:26.400]   Enterprise technology moves so fast and so much is at stake, especially now
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:32.000]   That you you know, if you're a hospital they have lots of health care
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.920]   clients
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:37.200]   You're you're dealing with a whole new world. They can help you

[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:48.640]   high stakes world of enterprise computing to learn more about ww t the atc and you know someday
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:56.800]   I hope you get to go to st. Louis and see it, but you don't have to now ww t.com/twit create an account set up some on-demand labs
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:02.560]   And learn ww t's the kind of partner you want. That's why their customers stay with them year after year after year

[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:18.400]   Around the world. We're big fans. We did a panel. I forgot you were at you were out there for the panel Alex. Yeah, I was super impressed
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:24.560]   Yeah, it was it was a lot of fun and and I just like who are these guys? I know I never heard of them
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:30.400]   And then and they had this I mean the AV set up alone. They it was perfect. They had everything
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.960]   they had a beautiful auditorium they
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.960]   and
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:42.000]   Do you you came in while we were getting the the tour and they had the big screen and they have cameras everywhere? It was amazing
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.960]   Now it's blown away. It really amazing. Yeah, yeah
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:52.080]   Uh, but it but do put do put do yes, I will be on office hours. I don't know what I'm gonna talk about on thursday
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:59.200]   It's like I don't we were talking about it this morning. I really see it as kind of a reverse triangulation. I get to interview you so so it's uh
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:03.200]   Yes, so I so what will happen is is that I'll

[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.440]   I had no idea like I just made it easier to read. I didn't realize that it was a case sensitive
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:46.000]   It's camel case. I was like the office. I was like I had no idea. So so anyway, please

[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:55.680]   Uh, it's gonna be great. I gotta I got my a7s. I got the little dummy batteries. I got the tripods
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.960]   I got i'm ready. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I got my a10 mini
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:02.880]   I'm gonna be ready. Excellent. I might be ready for all I need is like
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.040]   That's all started at a five thousand what?
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.080]   Yeah, that's pretty much
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:13.040]   I'm uh, I'm ted to uh, what is his name? Ted Baxter. Ted Baxter. That's me. Hello, mr
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.320]   I got a smear
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:22.960]   It was so broad we're talking about the mary tylenmore show and uh
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.840]   But it was so broad, but I guess it was you know we that's that's how we liked it in those days
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.360]   Now you could turn their wall down with her smile. Yes, she could
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:38.000]   She was lorry gill before lorry. Do you ever wear a little beret lorry and just spin around and throw it in the air
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.800]   You ever do that?
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.480]   Of course, this is kind of a kind of a different place to
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.880]   It's a different place now. Isn't it? Yeah, yeah
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:52.000]   That's for sure. I want to be careful as you're spinning around. Yeah, watch the watch for the rubber bullets
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.600]   Uh apple the big reopening is starting
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:59.120]   Scares the pants off of me, but not the mask
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.840]   Not the mask
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.400]   I may be going around pantless, but i'm never going around mask
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:09.840]   Uh, the question is going to be how are they going to deal with the jerks?
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.880]   How are they gonna say no all the people that are wearing a mask that yeah, yeah, exactly. Well, I have a mask
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.520]   I'm fine. Are they
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.040]   Mike is uh
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.320]   Mike is a significant other works at starbucks
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.120]   and uh
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.360]   They don't they wear masks and they require customers coming in the store to wear a mask
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.520]   Guys says no
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.440]   And says i'm sorry. You can't come in you have to wear a mask to come in. He said i'm gonna cough on you
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:38.080]   and he coughs on yeah, it's like
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.040]   Why are people such jerks?
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.600]   Yeah, what the hell wear a mask? It's not such a big deal. In fact, they're kind of nice
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.080]   You had no face recognition works anymore
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.760]   Yeah
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:56.800]   It's great. No, no one knows if you live in a place like Sacramento, uh, it's but it's good for allergies too. Oh, man
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:04.000]   We need them here. We need them here. Yeah, so apple will be reopening 70 plus stores in the us in canada this week
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.760]   Uh, and yes, they're gonna you're there'll be a questionnaire when you come to the store are you feeling okay?
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.840]   any temperature any as uh temperature or sniffles a
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.440]   Taste this hot dog. Can you taste the mustard that kind of thing?
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:23.440]   Uh, there are employees and customers will have temperature checks face coverings are required
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.760]   Social distancing they're gonna limit the number of people come in. They're doing everything right
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.200]   They're doing everything right. Yeah, but all I can think of is
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.760]   To some apple boy going
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:42.720]   Is this muster catch up? What do you think close your eyes close your eyes hot dog or not hot dog
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:50.080]   Um actually as of as of today 154 of apples
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.480]   271 stores in the us have reopened
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   365 stores around the world are open they've done
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.520]   Uh, you know, they've done a pretty good job of drop off and pick up curbside
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.160]   I my iPhone need to be fixed. I just shipped it to them that worked fine. It was very quick
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.040]   Um, but I guess peep I guess
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.480]   Why reopen because people have to see this stuff or something
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.480]   Um
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:22.160]   I there's a lot of service issues. There's there's you know, there's service issues as people who do want to get something faster than apples
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:27.440]   Ready to send it to them. I mean, there's a bunch of I think there's a bunch of reasons to go ahead and open it if you're in within a
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.920]   um
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.320]   You know if if if it if you can do it carefully
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.240]   I also think that there's just a general sort of
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.120]   social
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:44.320]   Construct of stores being open that make us feel better and even though right now
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:51.280]   We have a lot of fear about the economy opening back up and going into stores and the dangers that come along with that
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:54.560]   We're more comfortable
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.080]   When our economy is open and we'll spend more money and
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:00.800]   maybe apple is just kind of
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.880]   just going with the flow
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.640]   because
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:05.920]   you know
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:12.720]   Everybody like not everybody but a lot of people want to open the economy back up and and the the normalcy of it is a
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.640]   Sense of comfort even though we're afraid of it, you know
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:23.520]   I think I think another factor is that you really want to get those employees back and getting them paid
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:28.000]   Before they leave for other jobs because they got to make money somewhere
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.720]   Uh, and if you if you lose half of your employees and then you have to retrain half of them
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.400]   Uh by the time you by the time the the Christmas season rolls around
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.880]   That's a super bad thing on top of simply wanting to get your employees back to work and paying them and getting them
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.040]   Making sure that you're there. They're still on health coverage and everything else that they're they count on
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.240]   Uh, it's a it's a it's an odd calculus and like I said, I'm the
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:59.040]   The only thing that I'm afraid I'm not afraid of stores being able to make sure that social distancing
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.880]   Make sure they're they're they're moving tables apart so that people are not going to be
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:08.880]   Close together making sure that everybody who enters wears a mask even taking temperatures of people coming in
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:15.840]   I'm just concerned about jerks who are going to try to make this into an untenable situation for everybody
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:21.280]   I was I went food shopping yesterday and you have to have a mask to get in and a lot of people just
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:25.680]   You seem to think that that that that that mask is simply their entrance ticket
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.320]   And once they are inside with it, it doesn't matter if they wear it or not and they're inside a grocery store
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.560]   and
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.400]   I'm and this and this and we're not talking about like
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.840]   an avenue of total jerks. They're just people who
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:43.360]   Seem to think that the the emergency is over just like we're in new england
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.760]   They're we're they're using the same mental software
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.720]   We use when there's a hurricane or a snowstorm that oh gosh
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:54.960]   Well, that was a bad one. We we had to stay inside the house for three four days while it snowed and then it was a whole week before power got back on
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.560]   But well, we're out of it now and now everything's everything's back to normal. It isn't
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:03.280]   I think there was a lot of people that were impatient, you know to get back into it
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:07.120]   And I think that while the protests had a lot of valid reasons for them
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.720]   I think that they just they broke the window open, you know, they broke that that dam
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.800]   And uh, and I think at this point we're never going back. There won't be any more
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.760]   I don't think we'll ever go back to stay at home no matter what happens
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:22.560]   Like I I just think that there's a bunch of people that have that you know, uh, you know from
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:28.640]   Not not the cities that that just we're ready to go back to doing with them and a lot of them that are in the cities
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:31.280]   We have to remember that a lot of people are so I think that apple
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.200]   I think that a lot of companies are taking that into account
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.040]   They're going to try to do it as as carefully as they can
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.360]   But I think whatever we were doing to be safe
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:41.760]   I think we're you know, we're gonna we want to keep doing it and we want to keep on putting those on
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.360]   But I think that we've turned a corner where we're not I don't think that it's going to reverse
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.720]   You know, and so I think the protests broke the
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:53.840]   I think this was starting before the protests. I I think just people were fed up
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:56.240]   They were done people were people were fed up and tired of it
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:59.360]   But it was a lot of folks that just said well if they can do it, I can do it
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.840]   And once they started going back to it they're they're not I don't think we can put the bottle
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.680]   I don't think we can put the genie back in the bottom
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:09.120]   And I think that the protests were had a lot of valid
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.160]   Foundations, so I'm not I'm not saying that people shouldn't protest it
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:16.800]   I'm just saying that when when we get once we turn that corner, it was it was over
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:21.600]   You know like an and it and I don't think I don't think the protest has anything to do with that though
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.160]   I'm not sure if that's what you're
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.640]   Like that that's kind of where you're standing with that
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:30.560]   I think if there was not a single protest that happened in the last three weeks
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:33.440]   We would be in this exact same place with people
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.560]   Yeah, I mean I kind of I agree with you Alex. I saw this coming
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.160]   That I just because there was no other way, right?
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:46.080]   Uh, it was like nobody's gonna put up with this for another year. It's just not gonna
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.280]   You know, it's
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:51.600]   And now I think that there's still going to be companies that don't want to put you know, we're not bringing our employees back
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:56.400]   You know hell no well and and also there's and there's also going to be you know, I don't think I don't want to die
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.960]   And I don't think we're going to see a big um, I don't think we're going to see a big events
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:04.480]   You know, and I don't think that companies are going to fill back up to 100 percent in their thing
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:06.560]   So though that all I think is still going to happen
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.680]   But I think as far as retail outlets, I think the problem you get into is
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:15.040]   Why do you open one and not the other? I mean, why do you not have an apple store open but have a grocery store open?
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.040]   I mean the grocery store talked
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.960]   Because people have to eat. Yeah, they don't have to buy a Mac
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.680]   I mean, I might but most people don't have to
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:30.320]   But I think that for not just for apple but and I think apple could afford to you know, have this have this move forward
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:34.480]   But I think for a lot of companies, you know, they're the I don't know. I mean the numbers are
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:38.640]   Stunning you know for a small business. Oh, yeah, I agree half
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.120]   You know, it's a high price that aren't gonna ever
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:45.040]   120,000 people dead is a high price to pay so you could sell your
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.040]   apples in the apple stand
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:51.120]   I mean, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna argue about about what what we should or shouldn't do in that area
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:56.560]   I'm just saying that I I think it's more of the reality that we're probably in is that these stores are gonna start to open
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.520]   No, I agree. Yeah, I agree
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.320]   I don't think I think it has less to do with economics
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:08.000]   I mean obviously for those businesses it might but for the people going to those stores or going to those restaurants are going
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.400]   Or out and about without mass. It's just I'm done. I can't do it anymore
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:15.120]   and I'm done and
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:18.800]   I'm if I get it I get it somebody in the chat room just said it only has a 90
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.120]   It has a 95 recovery rate
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:29.280]   So one in 20 will die. Okay, Russian real with a with a with a 20 round magazine
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.320]   I can live with that
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.960]   I already
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:40.240]   Months ago, I decided I decided I'm not even going to have any hopes of having
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.360]   being out of lockdown before the end of June and
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.280]   The way of the way that I look at things right now
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:48.560]   I'm not looking I'm not making any plans for July either
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:50.800]   And I don't know what's going to go on for the rest of the year
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.040]   But there is no way you're going to get me inside a plane
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:59.040]   For at least for at least no way in hell. I could right when I say this I'm not complaining
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.120]   I could do this forever like
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:07.120]   We are all we are all made to do this. This is I'm not saying that I want to go back to it
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.360]   I'm I'm a lot people have to go back to work
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.800]   There a lot of people need work and they don't want to or not
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.720]   They're being they're being told
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:24.080]   We they're going back to restaurants where they're telling the the the government that they're masking up and they're taking precautions
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.640]   They get to work and they find out that they're not and that if they don't go back and take their jobs back
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:33.120]   They lose their unemployment because they turn down a return to work and how they're sad
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.080]   Give up not only your health but the health of the people that you love well at the end of july the
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.600]   $600 extra $600 payment in the unemployment check goes away
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.760]   Mortgage
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:49.760]   For parents goes away in october. I mean there are going to be some economic events that are going to also precipitate this
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.800]   Um, I don't know. What are you going to do wear a mask folks if you can please?
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.840]   Easy that you're doing it for us. Not I wear a mask to protect you not
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.480]   You know, I'm far more worried
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.600]   I'm far more concerned about being a carrier than I am getting it
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:11.440]   I haven't exactly I've gotten sick like twice in the last 10 years and it was because I took a vaccine for yellow fever
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.960]   So so the only you know, so I don't really have a lot of you know
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.160]   I don't I'm not worried about myself
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.400]   I'm worried about that I won't even notice that I'm gonna be one of those ones that doesn't even notice that I have it
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.960]   And I'm spreading it out. So so that's when I go out. I'm more far more concerned about other people that's fair
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.760]   That's very fair. Yeah, I always just assume everybody's sick and myself included and act and act and act so
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.320]   I like making masks
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:40.480]   Apple is uh, there's a little battle going on and I feel like I have a tiny bit of stake in this battle you all know
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.360]   adjacent freed and david hannah mire hansen of base camp
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.880]   Fame we've had both of them on a twit many times
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:52.720]   Uh big fans dhh created ruby on rails
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.720]   Made a little bit of money
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.720]   He's now he embraces his Ferraris
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.960]   Uh, but they uh, they wanted to start a new email
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.240]   application kind of a clever idea
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:10.320]   Uh to try to fix the problems with email and they decided that they wanted to call it hey
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:17.360]   But hey.com was h-e-y not h-a-y h-e-y dot com was owned by somebody
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:23.520]   You might remember dane golden who for a long time was my right hand here at twit
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:29.600]   Uh, and I remember how much dane loved the fact that he was dane at hay.com and owned hay.com
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.560]   And he built his business after he left twit he's built his business around it
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.120]   Uh, he wasn't uh, he wasn't
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:38.640]   Squatting on it that was his that was his brand hay.com
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.800]   Uh, and so jason free who talks about this in the blog post he said
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:47.280]   Uh, I I found out that dane owned it and I remember dane from when I was on twit
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.840]   So I so they had an email back and forth
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.360]   Uh, they offered him some money dane said yeah, that's no
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.360]   It's it's too valuable to me. It's my business is my brand. I'm not gonna sell it to you for that. So
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:03.440]   Uh, they walked away and then a month or two later dane calls and says, you know, somebody else is trying to buy it
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:06.880]   Because I really think the world of base camp and jason and david
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:10.480]   I'd like you to give at least give you the first rate of first refusal now
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:16.080]   I don't know how much dane got but jason freed says it was a painful amount of money
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.000]   Go dane go dane. I'm so happy
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.840]   Like i'm so happy. I hope you got I hope he's just sailing on one of those yachts out in the medic draining right now
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:30.480]   Love right on that that is so awesome. Yeah, so happy for that really happy for dane
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.920]   I think that's great news
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.720]   But there's a little trouble in paradise because in order to make that money back
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.320]   Uh base camp had an idea and I think a very clever idea
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.320]   So this is it going to be an email service. It's invitation only launches next month
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:47.520]   I immediately said please, you know, give me I haven't got it yet
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:50.800]   You can download the app but until you get the service you can't use it
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.960]   Uh, it's on ios and andra they're gonna make mac and windows. They're gonna make a web version
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:58.080]   Uh, they got it on the app store with version one
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.800]   but then they
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.960]   Try to get a fix up there one on one. It was turned down
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:11.280]   And turned down again apple cited rule the infamous rule three dot one dot one
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:14.000]   Which says if you want to be able
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.720]   If you want people to be able to buy stuff
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.360]   They have to be able to buy it
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:26.160]   Through the apple payment system. Now the way hay.com works. It's 99 bucks a year for the email service
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:32.160]   If you want a two letter at hay.com if you want to be you know
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.640]   Ai at hay.com that'll cost you a thousand a year
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.960]   If you want three letters, I was a little disappointed because I would love leo at hay.com
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:44.240]   And I probably could have gotten that from dane before he sold it
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:51.760]   That's 350 bucks and there is nothing in the app that lets you buy that in the app
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:55.840]   You go to base camp.com and you buy it there apple says no, uh, uh
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:00.560]   You have to you have to do it in app purchase
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.920]   David hannah mire hanson says over my dead body
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.320]   He said it first. Well, we figured we got the monday morning reviewer
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:13.520]   So they tried again and no
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:16.080]   um
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.520]   They point out there a lot of other email apps like spark and edison that
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:25.280]   Allow users to log into existing accounts without signing up through apple reviewer said
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.160]   Doesn't matter who else is doing it. You can't
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:35.280]   Uh hannah mire says, you know, we're not going to pay the 30 apple tax. There's just no way we're going to do it
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:37.840]   um
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.840]   And uh, you know
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.320]   By the way this ties in with the fact that apple just announced they made
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.280]   Uh that the ecosystem facilitated half a billion dollars in sales last year
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:53.280]   I think i think it happened trillion half a trillion pardon me 519 billion half a trillion which apple
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.240]   Presumably got a third
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:01.360]   Um, it only took 15 percent of of of the of the subscription stuff
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.160]   so
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.960]   Uh, it's going to be interesting because d h h
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:12.080]   Is is an immovable object and apple is
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:13.840]   a uh
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:20.800]   Irresistible force so I don't or maybe it's the other way around actually dhs is an irresistible force. That's apple. It's the immovable object
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.760]   Um, what do you think?
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:28.000]   You got to have that ios app, don't you
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.800]   And apple really i mean it's charging the premium it's really hard. Yeah
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:38.240]   There is never in a million years a way that I am paying apple a third of our revenues
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:43.520]   That is obscene and it's criminal says d h h and I will spend every dollar
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:48.400]   We have or ever make to burn this down until we get to somewhere better
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.600]   Well, I think that's
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:59.040]   That's a really great bold statement because where does change happen? It it starts with some pretty bold statements, right? So
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:06.000]   He is he testified in for the congress about the anti-competitive nature of big tech. I mean, this is not a new
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.680]   uh
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.200]   cause for him
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:14.720]   And I I do think that it it should be it it should be an option for a developer
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.600]   to choose whether or not they want to
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:20.640]   you know, make their
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:24.960]   um subscription service available directly through the app or from a website
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:31.120]   I don't think that they should be forced to buy the the phone holder or the phone maker or whatever so
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.840]   You know apple says
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.520]   You know, we're just the the store where people put their apps, right? That's their sort of stance
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:45.360]   We don't own these apps. We're just the store where people put their apps and we they can sign it to us. So
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:48.240]   if that's the case then
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.520]   the the person who's you know put their app in your store shouldn't be
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:56.400]   forced to
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:02.640]   Display their app the way you want it to I'm literally thinking of a physical store like a record store like
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.240]   It you know, I don't go to a record store consignment and then have them
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.960]   um, you know display they don't tell me well the only reason the only way I'm gonna
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.640]   consign your records is if you you know put them in
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:21.200]   Photo frames or something like that, you know, like they don't put limits on it. There's it's a it's a
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:27.920]   It's a way, you know, what is the consignment store take what percentage of the consignment store take of the sale?
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:35.680]   Well, that's so that would be where you know the changes could you know, there could be some changes that need to be made where instead of apple
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:40.160]   requiring 30% of every purchase made or 15% of every
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.600]   subscription made there could be an option where for a one-time fee you could
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:50.800]   Put you know put your app in the app store or or a yearly fee you can put your app in the app store
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.480]   Um, and then that would be like that would be like saying i've got a pile of i've got a pile of jeans
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:57.760]   I want to sell from a consignment store. I want to pay you a hundred bucks and then make as much as I want on the jeans
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:03.040]   No, but the point no but but but consignment stores the only point of sale in this case
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:09.680]   Hey is set up so you subscribe to it. They just want apps on the store just as just as Netflix you pay Netflix
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:15.920]   And then there's an app on the store. I don't see that that's an unreasonable thing. That's rent seeking and from apples
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:21.600]   For apple. I I think this is gonna get apple on trouble there today already there's two
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.000]   Count them two anti-competitive actions going on in the EU against apple
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:35.120]   I think that is also trying to mentally use including including tim cookin on in july to talk about every single tech companies processes
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:41.520]   This is a really really good time if you are a company that's really really annoyed by apple taking a cut of everything you do
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:47.360]   To really really you could be the mouse that roared that you could be exactly the sort of witness that a lot of people
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:50.720]   And a lot of really fancy board boardrooms want to see right now
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:53.520]   I mean, I think that you might see some of the EU because they're crazy
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:58.240]   You know, they're the EU is just crazy, you know, so they might they might go down some some crazy path
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.560]   But the problem that they're gonna have is that
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:04.800]   Apple has a minority stake in the mobile mobile phone market
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:10.800]   You know, if you don't if you if you have other places that you can go it is not a phone the iPhone is not
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:16.000]   A platform in itself. It is a phone platform and android is much bigger than it is
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000]   And so the thing is if we can't have hey on iOS we're nowhere
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.360]   We have to be in the biggest platform in the segment and apple knows that
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:29.200]   So they're holding our feet. I know but it's the way the way at least in the United States the way the way that works is they
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:34.400]   Really have to have a at least a majority if not and generally when we start up talking about antitrust
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:39.120]   We're talking about 80 90 percent of the market. That's where microsoft got itself in trouble when 80 90 percent of the market
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:43.280]   How how google gets in trouble is you know large large percentage of the market?
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.520]   I don't know exactly what google is but it's close to that
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.720]   You know at at 40 percent of the market or less
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.440]   It it starts to become really complicated to argue that that you that you own that market
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:58.000]   Yeah, you have a great you have a great part of that market you have the most profitable part of that market
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.480]   But it doesn't mean that you that you are you have
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:05.840]   Monopoly leverage over that market and so the thing is is that just because people don't like the business model
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:10.160]   The argument is is that you can go to the larger part of the market apple doesn't owe these people this
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:11.680]   They they made a better
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:15.200]   They made a better platform to make money than everyone else it doesn't mean that they owe them
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:19.760]   Now that they've built this thing that is a safer place to put your app that's easier to sell
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.240]   I mean as someone who developed you know has built these you know built apps and sold them
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:27.840]   I mean there is no platform better than the than than apples
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:32.720]   You know than the iOS to build to sell an app because it's because of all the other infrastructure
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:37.200]   You can distribute something for free you can you have all that all that transfer all the
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:40.160]   Ecommerce all those other things are taken that apple has built
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.800]   You know that they built a level of trust
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:47.520]   You know with the user that you can download these things and they're not going to cause a bunch of trouble for you later
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.280]   And so the thing is is that that that ecosystem is something that apple built
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:54.960]   Um that they they don't owe anybody if you don't like it go somewhere else
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:59.840]   You know like like really like if you don't like it go somewhere else it is a minority part of the market
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:01.120]   They don't owe you that
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:03.680]   You know that and that's the thing that just drives me crazy is that you know
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:10.560]   This this level of entitlement that that app developers have that they think that they can just force apple to go do something that they they have built
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:17.200]   A magnificent platform for this, you know and they're frustrated that nobody else can do that because what it takes is what apple did
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:22.320]   You know and the thing is is that but it's still a minority part of the market and you're not gonna
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.320]   I mean, I don't know
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:30.480]   You know you maybe you can persuade the next administration the next congress and everything else to pass something
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.920]   There is no way that's going to go through the supreme court the current supreme court
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.320]   No way you are a pipe dream because it's not constitutional
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:42.000]   Like it's not it doesn't make any sense. It's it's there they don't own
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.960]   They don't own a hundred percent of the apple market
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:51.760]   They own a a minority percentage of the phone market and there and and it's just bs to say that they have their own market
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:57.520]   You know and i'm just sorry i'm just saying it's i think it's up to the if it's up to the ftc to decide that
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:01.200]   And they could go and we will then go to supreme tikli who will strike it down
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:05.040]   I think so Alex you're ignoring the harm to users
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.880]   Uh, i'm not talking about necessarily the harm to base camp
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:11.680]   But but if I want to use this app
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:17.520]   On an iphone i can't because apple says no no you have to give us 30 if you want to be on this platform
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:22.000]   I think that's a chance decision. Well, but yeah, i'm base camp is going to be on android
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:30.480]   But uh, i'm an ios user and I would like to use hey on my phone the reason that and again apple is extraordinary in its
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:33.040]   uh, I think
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:36.560]   Imperial nature of what it allows and doesn't allow in the app store
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.280]   It's bizarre it allows
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.160]   I don't think that i don't think that i don't think that that's crazy
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:48.800]   I don't think we should be having the conversation about whether or not the federal government will you know claim this or that i think yes
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.880]   Yeah, and it it it comes down to
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.480]   how apple looks it comes down to the sort of
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:57.280]   It's you know
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:01.120]   Culturally so you know apple donates to lots of amazing causes because
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.080]   In part it makes them look good. So
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:11.200]   In part it makes them look good that they bring all this money into these for these app developers and that app developers want to participate in their
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.120]   ecosystem, but the more app developers start
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:22.560]   Feeling frustrations at the way apple's been doing things for the last 10 years. They're not been changing that
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:25.200]   the the more they're gonna
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:31.280]   Look bad culturally and I think it behooves them to start looking at what they're doing now
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:37.120]   and and decide whether or not there's some changes that they could make that could be a compromise to everyone because
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:42.480]   Culturally they're going to start looking bad the more they they put their you know dig their heels in
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:46.960]   The more they're going to look bad to everybody who's wanting some kind of changes
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:53.360]   It affects it affects a thousandth of 1% of all the app developers and 2% of the people actually pay attention to it
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.680]   I mean, this is a this is such a what about users?
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:59.680]   No, but what about users who won't get access to that service on iOS?
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:05.040]   99% of the users don't know it exists and and the 99 left don't care
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:06.320]   What if it's a
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.560]   Which by the way it is a really cool take on email that I think they deserve access to
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:16.240]   You say who cares?
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:21.280]   I just don't think most of the no harm. I just know it's just they don't they're not gonna care
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.360]   It's it's some edge case. I mean no one's you know, I mean how many people really use other email
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:29.520]   You know services. I mean like how many apps that's no, no, but like literally
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:36.080]   99% of of of iPhone users use mail, you know, like there, you know, and and so it's it is not a
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.680]   You know, this we're really you know, these people complaining about edge cases
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.880]   You know and this is this is really an edge case and I think that it is I get that people have this
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:50.960]   But there's an awful lot of app developers that are the vast majority that are quite happy with an ecosystem that allows them to do what they do
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:53.280]   You know, and there's frustrations that I have with it
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:55.360]   I mean, I can't you know the way that you
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:01.440]   Want to send something to for a review copy or whatever is just a disaster, you know inside of this platform, you know, and there's
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:06.960]   There's all kinds of things that that don't work, but um, I can say as an app developer, you know
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:13.440]   Is or someone who has been an app developer and probably will be soon again at some point in the near future
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.880]   I don't
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:19.520]   Like there's no other platform that has been built that way and and to have someone be able to build something up and then people
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:21.600]   Just barge in and say but we want to do it our way
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:25.680]   I mean, I think that by building something that takes an enormous amount of work
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.600]   You have a certain level of the ability to control your own destiny
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:34.320]   Related to that and I think that um, I think that people people don't like it
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.680]   Then don't don't use it, you know and and you know and if they the reason that they're upset is because they know that 90
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:43.440]   Percent of the revenue will come from that platform because people don't buy things on
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:51.200]   Hold on. What is your obligation to apple if you write a mac application and they spend a lot of money on the amac
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:53.920]   Device and they put a lot of energy into it
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:58.240]   Don't you owe them some money for getting to ride on their platform or microsoft for getting it right on
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:00.720]   Well, if you want to do it from the app if you want to do it in the app store you do
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:03.200]   Right
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:05.680]   Is this isn't their past apple to deliver that app
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:11.040]   If apple gave us a choice, but we have to use the app store. We don't have a choice
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:14.160]   But again, it's it's it's as if you built you know
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:19.120]   You built a big building that that happens to be really really good at what it did and people want to put stores in there and you're like
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:22.960]   Well, this is what I I'm not charging you rent. I'm just charging you part of your revenue
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:25.200]   If you don't like it go to another building people either right
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:29.280]   You're I certainly don't deny their right to do it, but I don't think it's right. I don't think it is right
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:37.840]   Yeah, and at some point it really and you you're right on a lot of this Alex that most people aren't going to care
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:40.640]   But we're talking about it right now because some people care
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:46.560]   But most of our ever I think it is it's a good it would be a good thing for apple to
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:52.560]   To just kind of pay it like read the room, you know, and if the room really isn't speaking that loudly then they can shut the door
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:54.400]   But there's I don't if you read the room
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.240]   It's a bit clear what we say read the room
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:01.040]   There's a there's 10,000 people in the room and there's three people in the back there screaming like little protesters
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:03.600]   I mean that is the room that apple is getting with right now
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.680]   We can talk about it in this, but that's really the room
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:09.840]   This is this is the only thing that I wanted to say in response to all of this
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:16.240]   That the function and the most useful role of legislators and regulators
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:19.600]   Is not to verify that the happy people are happy
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:25.440]   But to listen to the people who are unhappy and what and ask if they have actually have a legitimate beef or not
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:30.480]   Doesn't matter if it's just 10 people out of a thousand if these 10 dandler being ripped off
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:35.040]   It's up to it's again and that's and whether they never don't care. I don't care about the numbers
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:36.640]   I don't care about
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:41.360]   The perception of how well the app store is doing for the developer community is at large
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:45.200]   I don't care about the fat the idea that some developers are just whining
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:51.280]   I think that this is a legitimate question and that if someone were to bring it up to the house
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:56.880]   Judiciary committee is not not ridiculous to consider that they would want to take a look at this
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:58.880]   I should also point out the supreme court
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:04.240]   Was asked about this last year remember and apple lost apple wanted to thrown out
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:06.080]   um
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:11.120]   That the app store 30 commission was an unlawful that was fair use of apples man
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:15.040]   Monopoly that was a technical but that was a technical thing over standing
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:18.320]   Whether the person had standing take the court they didn't they didn't say anything about
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:20.000]   Anything about it. It sent was constant
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.920]   Just whether they had standing to bring it to court
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:25.200]   And so that's a that's a very that's a much different technical that's right
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:28.560]   Technical piece there and and the thing is is that yes, it's it's it's it's
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:30.560]   It is there the rick
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:32.080]   pressing
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:36.160]   The the the issue the issue really is is that on top of that it is whether they
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:42.240]   Someone can be upset about the way a company's working do they have a constitutional right to to to turn that over
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.320]   And I don't think that that's gonna stand. I don't think it's gonna
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:45.440]   I don't think I
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.120]   They don't think they have a constitutional right to have stores work the way they want
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:53.600]   So you're right they have that you know, and then that's the issue and I think that apple has a constitutional right to build something
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:54:00.080]   There is a loss to end users whether they know it or not because this is if you go to hay.com and read how this program works
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:04.160]   I very much would love to have this as my email program
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.880]   And I will never be able to apparently on ios
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:13.280]   And that's a mistake I think for apple to make there is the point also that there are other email programs
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.320]   That are paid systems through other means that apple allows on the platform
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:25.440]   So I'm not but inconsistently applying the rules is different from doing the wrong thing. I think they're just doing the wrong thing
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:30.160]   But again, they have the right to do the wrong thing. I'm not denying that
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:33.280]   It's true. They do have the right. Yeah
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:37.840]   Well, and and maybe I don't know
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:41.760]   Maybe the EU will will weigh in on this
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:45.120]   That too too as of today too new
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:50.240]   EU investigations into apples business practices
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:54.640]   The cut in the apple store is one of them
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:55:00.880]   The other one is over closing nfc keeping nfc only
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:03.520]   to apple
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:08.240]   margaret de vistagure who is the head of competitive policy at the european commission says
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.920]   It appears that apple obtained a gatekeeper role when it comes to distribution of apps and content
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:20.080]   To users of apple popular devices. We need to ensure that apples rules do not distort competition in markets
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:22.480]   Where apple is competing with other app developers?
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:27.360]   For example, it's music streaming service apple music or with apple books or maybe apple male
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:31.040]   uh, versus uh, hey she didn't say that I did
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:37.600]   Um, I have therefore decided to take a close look at apples app store rules and their compliance with the EU competition rules
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.480]   So it may not change in the us probably won't but it might in the EU
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:47.600]   Um and apples probably paying attention to it. I don't know
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:51.680]   On it be it. I mean the question is is it how long how long will it stretch out?
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:53.520]   How long will people get the mail?
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:57.520]   Well, and by the time by the time you're able to get the mail, uh, it won't exist anymore
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:00.800]   Like who's that I mean mail is such an annoying thing in a gym email
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:03.520]   So is such an annoying form of communication at this point?
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:08.080]   Um, that's I think that that's the other thing is that I'm like if I have to use mail, I use it
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.520]   But well, that's why you should look at this Alex been not been be a little more open-minded
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.000]   Because if you look at hey.com, they actually solve a lot of the problems a lot of things you don't like about email
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.320]   They solve the big thing I try to solve is get people to not communicate with me in emails
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:26.080]   Here's the here's the reason I want email to work because it's the only way
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:31.280]   Uh people who I don't have a connection with in any other form can reach me and you
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:36.880]   and uh unless you figure twitter is your main form of communication and uh,
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:42.000]   I think that email that works would be a very desirable thing and I think it's a very interesting step
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.400]   These guys are smart. I think it's a very interesting stab at the problem
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:52.480]   But we will never find out because I'm glad I'm I just the only thing I'm saying I'm glad that day made a lot of money
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:57.840]   Yeah, yeah, and I think he gets to keep it regardless of what happens here. I love that
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:00.800]   So about the the EU
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.920]   um
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:08.960]   Investigation thing I I I think the the second one that's in that article about um apple and
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:18.480]   Payment systems. I think that one really is a stretch and kind of leans into Alex's joke about how the EU is crazy because
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.200]   So you're so crazy. It's all time. It's apple pay. It's not
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:30.080]   A closed system. You can put any one of your credit cards onto apple pay right for so from the perspective of the user
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:33.200]   It's not closed off from the perspective of the
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:38.080]   POS companies. I guess would be the other perspective
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.720]   You can use your credit card to
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:47.440]   Make a payment at any payment service any POS in any store. You don't have to use your phone to do it
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.480]   So that one seems really off the mark that seems really barking up the wrong tree
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:59.840]   in that so if if apple opened up the NFC chip to other again, I can't imagine what they'd be
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.560]   talking about but other
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:05.920]   payment service systems POS as you know like
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:09.120]   coin star whatever like
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:13.280]   Like where is that going like are they is the implication that
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:21.120]   Like apple or that google wallet should be on iphone. I don't know like I it seems really weird
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:23.760]   Yeah, and this is one where I agree with you and Alex
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:27.680]   Because like apple put the NFC in
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.920]   Again, it disadvantages us as users that we can't use it for other things
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:37.520]   But apple has a good reason I think maybe any competitive, but it may also be for security purposes
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:42.720]   uh to keep the NFC mobile payments to their own service
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:46.560]   And you know they take a cut of it so it could be it could be about money
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:50.160]   But all all POSs is take a cut so it's not like
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:54.880]   You're being anti-competitive because now bank of america has to pay 15
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:58.080]   Like any POS has that option
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:04.000]   Higher than that here's what vista here says it's important that apples measures do not deny consumers the benefits
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.760]   Of new payment technologies including better choice quality innovation and competitive prices
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:14.640]   Now by the way in both cases investigations going on they haven't yet
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:17.520]   um took taking them to court, but
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:22.880]   That is always the argument again in my opinion against
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:25.760]   Any competitive measures is it reduces innovation?
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:32.480]   It it hampers somebody from doing something better or different or new
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:36.400]   Yeah, well, I I think I think if we wanted to
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:40.640]   Improve innovation we could do a lot more by rewriting the copyright rules
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:45.680]   You know in patent. Oh, I agree with you on that. Yes. I mean like if we want to make real change
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:49.040]   Like we're talking about minor change with apple. We're talking about minor change
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:53.760]   We're talking about real change that would actually benefit folks. We would start talking about
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:58.160]   Twilighting copyright and you know after 50 years crazy
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:05.200]   You know like and and and say you have to actually use your patent after x number of years or you don't get to keep it or you know
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:11.280]   14, you know, there's a whole you know, there's a whole lot of things that could be done that would make things move a lot faster
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:13.440]   We're held up in
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:18.880]   You know home if we want to talk about holding us up as users into homeostasis. It's copyright and patent laws
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:24.800]   I was going to ask you guys to take bets on how long open core would be able to make and sell their hackintosh
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:27.440]   Uh
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:30.000]   But when you click on the link that leads to their site
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.680]   Boom
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:40.640]   So I guess there's no reason to bet that it seems like apple has come down on they were actually it was pretty cool professionally built
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:45.840]   Hackintosh systems running rise and zen two processors
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:51.040]   Mac pro power at a slither of the costs says open core
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:56.800]   Um, is it me or does that seem like it defeats the purpose of the hackintosh though
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:02.080]   Like the point is that you're building it yourself and you the joy of diy and it seems like that's kind of
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:11.120]   Defeats that whole purpose. There's no way they're right and there's and the responsibility of learning enough in the process that when there is a minor update to the os that
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:15.440]   Either bricks everything or you can't get that you know how to fix it yourself
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:18.640]   But I I might be misremembering. Did they was it?
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:25.360]   Was it apple that searched them or was the the symbol fact that they named the company and the product after an open source
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:33.600]   Oh, I don't know why they're down. Yeah for for uh, because that that's also the name of the open the common open source tool for
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:36.800]   Hackintoshing a
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:39.520]   Do it yourself diy and told bill
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:42.960]   Well, somebody got mad
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.440]   Uh, maybe they sold them all and decided they had maybe they're out of her loss of raptors more popular than they thought
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.440]   Yeah, every they're out of them. They're gone
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:54.960]   I would have this you can't update it right?
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:57.680]   You just have to keep it up. It's
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:03.040]   The the the the holy grail that is attainable is to make it compatible with software updates
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:09.600]   But the thing is it'll break at any moment. Right. It's not it's not there people who've built really wonderful hackintosh systems
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:13.440]   But it's always with the understanding that it will it's working now
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:19.840]   It might not work six months from now or even six hours from now and if it does break i'm responsible for trying to figure out
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:25.120]   Probably by working with the open source team exactly what has gone wrong and how to fix it
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:28.480]   so every june there is a little
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:33.280]   event that happens in china the anniversary of tenem and square and
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.000]   china cracking down
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.160]   uh in this case
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:42.960]   uh two apps removed from my apples china store pocket casts which is
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:48.400]   Our favorite podcast and then cast app and castro podcasts
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:53.360]   Are gone from the chinese app store at the request of the cyberspace administration
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:56.880]   Of china the country's internet watch dog
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:59.200]   um
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:03.280]   pocket casts as said why why we don't know why
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:08.000]   Uh, just because they told us to the probably has to do with chinese language
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.440]   anti-government podcasts, but yeah, I believe they're asked to remove specific podcasts that are
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:16.720]   anti-chinese government and they refuse to and so they're gone, okay
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:21.840]   Seems like they could just block the podcast. Good. They in china
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:29.440]   Uh, it's why why do that when you simply can exert control over the of the means of actually receiving podcasts
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:32.160]   And you just simply you simply have to keep blocking other podcasts
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:38.560]   Uh, it is a it is a more orderly solution from the chinese government's perspective to simply say look if you're operating a podcast
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:41.840]   catcher in our country you are going to essentially
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.040]   Operate it to our standards and our specifications as we require by law
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:53.840]   So what well done shifty jelly there actually considering that they're owned by npr and other public broadcasting concerns
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:56.400]   It would have been a very very
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:59.600]   Hypocritical thing for them to say sure will censor ourselves. No problem
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:03.200]   Very very good on them for doing the right thing. Yeah and apple
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:10.800]   I mean we've had this conversation a million times apples. You got to do what uh, the laws of the country you're in require
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:13.360]   You got me thinking andy though
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:16.560]   Think of the I mean first of all I was pretty
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:21.680]   Just dumbfounded that this happened at first like it. It seems really counter
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:26.480]   Whatever to what what apple has been saying for the last couple of weeks, but
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:36.640]   You just made me think of something. What if the chinese government had gone directly to you know shifty jelly and said you have to
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:38.240]   um
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:42.000]   censor these podcasts out or you can't have your app in
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.560]   In our country. So in other words when you take apple out of it
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:52.720]   Shifty jelly would have either done what china said or they would have came to the same decision
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:57.760]   So why did app why is it apples fault that that happened is where i'm start just now
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:04.640]   This is just now coming to me because this this train of thought and it's it's actually really interesting to think of it that way
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:07.040]   when we start talking about apple
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:09.440]   um cowtowing to other governments
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:16.800]   If we take apple out of that situation and we go from the developer directly to the government
[02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:19.760]   How does that change?
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:22.480]   You know, it's just something i'm thinking of
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:25.840]   Yeah, my understanding is that
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:28.320]   the
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:32.960]   Once so once apple set apple receives a formal request for removing app from the app store
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:40.080]   And china says here is what here is the here is the violation that we are citing apple just simply has to take it down
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:42.480]   um, I believe my i'm trying
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:50.080]   I looked at this last week. So my my memory might be fading me. I do believe that they were asked directly from china saying
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.480]   We can't let your operate we can't let your app operate inside uh
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:59.680]   Inside the cyberspace administration china won't allow you to operate this app unless
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:04.960]   You are going to restrict the podcast that you can get. I don't think they were asked
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:09.440]   So here's i'm looking at the article on tech crunch and there may be something later, but this is what tech crunch said
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:15.440]   uh pocket cast asked apple why apple said contact china directly
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:17.360]   Uh
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:22.160]   Shifty jelly says this is the quote. We'll most likely contact them to find out more though
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.960]   We weren't given that option to stop the app from being removed
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:29.200]   Only as a potential solution to have it reinstated a very small amount of warning
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:33.600]   We were given between there being a problem on our app being completely removed from the china app store was
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:36.240]   Quite alarming. We assumed
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:42.640]   That what they wanted us to remove are specific podcasts and possibly some of the black live lives matter content
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:44.640]   We posted but I don't know if they know
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:48.400]   Here's the threads the threads they put on uh on their twitter account
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:55.440]   pocket cast on june 10th pocket cast has been removed from the chinese app store by apple at the request of the cyberspace administration of china
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:00.320]   We believe podcasting is and should remain an open medium free of government censorship as such
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:04.000]   We won't be censoring podcast content at their request next tweet
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.160]   We understand this means that it's unlikely that our ios app will be available in china
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:13.760]   But feel it's a necessary step to take for any company that values the open distribution model that makes podcasting special
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:19.520]   Uh, and then follow up so when asked them we did to get contacted by china for the take down or was it just apple pulling the plug
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:28.400]   Bucket casts reply replies. We were contacted by the cac through apple around two days before the app was removed from the store
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:33.360]   There were no specific reasons provided even after we asked for clarification the overall reason
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:42.480]   I'm quoting pocket cast here. The overall reason was that we quote include content that is illegal in china as determined by the cac unquote, right?
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:44.320]   Okay
[02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:47.760]   But they didn't tell them what to take down. They just said we're taking we're taking the whole thing down
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:50.800]   Easier just to go to apple and say apparently pull it
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:56.480]   Yeah, yeah, that just solves the whole thing and you don't have to do all this complicated back and forth
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:08:00.560]   Democracy is so difficult
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:04.400]   So inefficient so inefficient
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:11.040]   Uh, let us I think we uh, we could be good time to get the pics of the week if
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:16.000]   You folks would like to i'm gonna just throw in to begin
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:18.480]   We last week we mentioned the uh itch
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:24.400]   Dot io bundle the itchy o bundle for racial justice and equality. I am very pleased
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:29.280]   To say that bundle ended up raising their goal was five million eight point one
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:31.280]   million
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:36.080]   Dollars gamers are extraordinarily generous. Of course they were getting an amazing deal
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:43.680]   Because they got 1,741 independent games and other content for five bucks. Although the average contribution was 10
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:50.560]   And uh, so that's pretty darn good. The money will be split between the n double a cp legal defense and educational fund
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:54.640]   And the community bail fund and now of course humble bundle
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:57.600]   Says hold my beer
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:01.040]   And this is good. This is the kind of competition you want, right?
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:05.280]   They've just started their fight for racial justice bundle
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:11.520]   This is uh, no h.io is indy games. This is these are less
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:19.520]   indie games much more including kerbil space program and be a 2k 20 bio shock remastered
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:24.640]   Uh age of wonders three. There's a lot of games in here for 30 dollars
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:27.600]   And it goes to a good cause
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:30.960]   So i'll just mention that you got a little less than a week
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:33.200]   uh to
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:35.040]   fight for racial justice
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:37.040]   With the humble bundle
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:41.600]   $43 worth of off some stuff for 30 dollars or more 100 percent goes
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:46.000]   To charity. So I love it. I hope this competition continues
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.840]   Uh larry gill your pick of the week
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:55.040]   Uh, hold on i'm buying this humble bundle. Oh, yes. It's a good bundle. I'm gonna buy it too. I'm just kidding. I'll wait
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:10:01.040]   No, it's pretty good. Look at all this stuff. It is. Yeah, it is. It's great. Okay. So um
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:06.240]   Taking it up to a little bit of light-heartedness. I just thought these were so funny. So
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:09.440]   Case to fi they regularly
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:15.360]   Launch these custom or not custom but these collections that are
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:20.800]   Special editions from different brands and this week they launched the heins
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:28.080]   edition. So wait a minute. What is ketchup? Oh, this is hysterical. It is ketchup
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:34.880]   They're they're like, you know, I don't know. They should be putting us for the advertising
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:40.880]   Yeah, but there's there it's just so funny that you can get ketchup bottles on your iPhone case
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:45.360]   My favorite one is actually the floaty one that has the french fries and the bottles of ketchup
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:50.080]   Yeah, I really like that one a lot and those move around right that's a floaty back so that yeah
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:53.920]   Yeah, it'll it'll move around. I just I like the french fries on that one too
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:11:00.480]   So if you're a fan of heins ketchup or you just think it's really funny to have a ketchup bottle on your iPhone case
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:04.080]   Case case to fi is uh is there for you
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:10.160]   It's national ketchup day. That's why you realize we've got to celebrate. Yes. Yeah, ketchup day
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:13.520]   Put your put your phone on the shelf in the grocery store
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:17.360]   C A s e t i f y dot com
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:25.280]   That's just so freaking do who pays whom does heins pay them or do they license it from heins? What do you think?
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:34.320]   You know, it's it's such a advertising game that I have a feeling that heins probably and i'm just guessing but heins probably
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:36.560]   Contacts them. Yeah, I would think so. Yeah
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:40.400]   Andy and aiko you got a plea a police scanner radio
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:43.520]   For us. I got I got two different fix just
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:46.400]   We're in the opera house. Holy moly
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.440]   The metro paltin opera uploaded a whole bunch of like zoom meeting backgrounds
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:56.480]   Not working very well because i'm using skype's automatic backgrounds. I don't have free screen. It's pretty good
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:02.400]   Excellics. Okay. I did have to take off my headphones. My headphones was was even worse and it's switched for my earbuds
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:06.960]   But you got the inside of the met opera house. Yeah, you can get the stage
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:10.160]   Lava m here
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:12.320]   Or you can get the the starburst
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:15.200]   Signature chandeliers
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:19.840]   Or you can get like just the the lobby the inside opera house here
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:26.880]   Or you could pretend to be like a pbs like life from lincoln center presenter and get like the external shots
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:30.720]   I think i like that one the best
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:35.600]   I like these are these these are all these are all highly solid choices
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:38.320]   But I do have an iOS app pick
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:44.400]   Because I was looking at police scanners for the first time since I used to like listen
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:48.800]   I used to have my like uni den handheld scanner like 20 or 30 years ago
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:51.920]   And I remember that of course there are now phone apps that do that
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:54.800]   There are people who have like actual terrestrial scanners
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:13:01.600]   And one of the features of these these police and fire emergency scanners is that they can stream audio to the internet
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.480]   And so a whole bunch of different phone apps can simply like tap into those streams and my favorite one
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:12.960]   It's actually available for both iOS and android is called police scanner radio and fire for iOS
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:16.880]   And man does it do a whole bunch of really really cool things
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:19.840]   the the cool thing about it is that
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:25.520]   It's kind of boring to simply to turn on your phone and say oh, what's my local like fire department
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:29.680]   Fire department frequency. Okay, here it is now just stream this to me
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:36.320]   But it can do and you can do that you can simply enable location access and we'll just you can say please show me
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.600]   uh
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:43.040]   Frequents, please show me like police fire emergency and whatever that are within 25 miles of me say
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:46.320]   Then you can pick one and then just be listening to like
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:14:01.920]   your
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:09.520]   Show me stuff that's 25 miles away. You can say automatically tune into anything within let's say 30 miles of my location
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:13.440]   If the number of listeners has suddenly gone up by 200 or 300
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:18.960]   And so if suddenly everybody is tuning into like Boston EMS Boston police and fire
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:23.280]   You can you can have a good idea that there's something bad going down in Boston
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:25.840]   And maybe something you want to pay attention to right now
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:31.120]   Or if you're only you don't you don't necessarily want to hear every single call
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:33.440]   That your fire department has about okay
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:37.200]   There's a there's a cat up a tree or there's somebody who lost their keys
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:42.800]   And they they're stuck up out on the porch and they're naked and they need someone to help them get back into get back into the house
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:48.640]   But if you if there's actually like a two or three alarm fire and suddenly instead of like two or three people listening
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:52.240]   They're not 14 people listening. You definitely want to start to listen to that
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:57.520]   So it really is a lot of fun and of course it works nationwide. I think even works worldwide
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:01.680]   So if you want to simply say anywhere in the country where there's suddenly a thousand times
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:05.760]   The number of people who are listening on something as you can guess last week
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:09.280]   There were a number of highly interesting
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:17.440]   Emergency channels that were where you're you're hearing exactly what police and EMS are talking to I was there is a peaceful protest
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:23.280]   That I forget where it was but there's a peaceful protest. I think it was somewhere in New England
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:29.440]   Where it was peaceful and the police were like reporting on how peaceful and boring it was
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:36.400]   There's like it's almost like there's a there's a Barney Fife there who was saying okay the oh they all suddenly stood up
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:42.320]   And then nothing else after that so they just I get stuck in their way
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:47.280]   So it's a cheap app you get the free version. I think with ads
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:54.080]   I think it's $2.99 and you own it without any ads. It's just a really really handy app to have on your phone
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:56.320]   it's in that category of
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:00.000]   At the time when you are really really interested to know
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:03.520]   What are what are all those sirens about or
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:09.040]   There's suddenly a news flash about something bad happening and you want to get as much information as you can
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:12.880]   It's nice to already have that on your phone and you already know how to use it very easy to use
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:15.360]   but very very handy and also
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:19.600]   It helps you to understand exactly what kind of operations are going down inside your
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:22.240]   Town like hour to hour day by day
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:32.320]   Nice I just downloaded it. I think now it's a good thing to have you never know. Yeah, is it legal? That's legal, right? Yeah, it's legal
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:34.400]   It's legal in most states
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:36.640]   some as
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:38.640]   I can't drive around
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:40.640]   in a old chp
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:44.080]   vehicle with a scanner on your dashboard
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:47.120]   And sunglasses at night
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:51.360]   But other than that some glasses at night, but no you can actually you can have inside your car
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:52.160]   Really?
[02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:56.880]   Most but I think it varies from state to state but most states that's completely not a problem
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:04.800]   Uh, transmissions are either encrypted or unencrypted if they're unencrypted then please know exactly that this is something that people do
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:06.400]   Yeah, it's through the air
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:11.120]   Alex lindsey we're going to end with you. How many Alex's is this going to cost me?
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:16.640]   Not not many not many not many at all in fact, it's almost free not quite free
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:22.800]   So I've talked about it before but I think that they they have a new update that I think is kind of interesting and something
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:24.960]   I've been thinking about and this is bellus 3d
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:28.960]   And this is an iphone app that will let you scan your head
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:31.600]   And so I bring it back
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:37.200]   Zerox machine because that was a lot of fun. Exactly. Exactly except you get 3d out the other end
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:45.040]   And so there are two uses one is one of the reasons I wanted to bring it up right now is they they actually have a new update to let you build your own
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:50.560]   Face mask so the structure or your face mask. I thought I thought that leo might i'm gonna do this right now
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:54.400]   Yeah, yeah, so you can basically scan your face and then it will build
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:58.480]   The the kind of that hard structure that you might want around your mask
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:04.160]   Um, you know for you and you it'll just it'll export an stl for a couple dollars two or three dollars or something like that
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:06.240]   And then you can just print it out on your printer
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.560]   And so so I think it's kind of cool. It'll also export it'll export the stl of that mask
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:13.520]   But you can also export an obj of your head
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:17.040]   And then the interesting thing about that is that if you want to design your own mask
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.520]   And so here's what i'm because what i'm working on is
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:23.040]   I can't believe someone hasn't done this yet and i'm not gonna turn into a business
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.880]   So i'm just gonna tell all you my big plan is they make these dpas without the hard piece here
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:32.720]   They make them just out of an end of the court. That's what they use in opera and and they make countrymen
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:35.840]   Well, the microphone uses the the microphone. I'm sorry here
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:40.240]   The microphone I use that it's a headset that I forgot to switch over to my other one. I hope I sounded okay today
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:42.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, anyway, so
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:45.200]   Um, so anyway, so this microphone
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:50.880]   They make it with just a little real thin cable. That's the same width as this this is here
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:53.600]   But it's so what I want to do is I want to have a face mask
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:58.720]   I have to do production and I need to be on comms and comms and face masks aren't
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:01.360]   You know, don't get it get along
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:04.720]   So what i'm working on right now is i'm scanning my face with bellis
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:07.520]   exporting to three an obj and then building
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:14.240]   Um a face mask that is designed to basically allow me to it's got little hooks on it that allow me to kind of snap in
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:17.280]   a countryman inside of it
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:21.600]   You want to wear a mask with your microphone in it with a mic inside of it
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:24.320]   Wow
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:26.160]   And so i'm using it for that um
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:31.040]   To do but i'm doing a little mind's a little harder because i'm actually building a 3d model of what I want
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:32.480]   And then then i'll put a
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:35.760]   It's an outer it'll be an ectoskeleton on the inside that i'll put something on it
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:37.920]   I'll put the face mask on the outside
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:42.880]   But on the inside it'll be something that I can snap my my mic into so that I can go back and have you know
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:44.720]   Have it be part of the comms
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:48.080]   Anyway, so that um but the point is is that i want to design your own mask
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:49.680]   There you go
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:52.080]   Are you absolutely certain this isn't just an excuse to
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:54.400]   Professionally wear a stormtrooper mask
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:57.840]   Because it sounds like you know, my way you're describing is a stormtrooper mask
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:01.680]   I don't I don't know if we were we were I'm missing but i'm still waiting for my bane mask
[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:03.680]   I'm I I really what I
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:08.880]   You know, I my my big dream is to have the bane mask and go to Whole Foods and say i're looking for the bananas
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:10.800]   And uh, yeah
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:12.800]   You know, so so anyway, but the uh
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:20.240]   Yeah, no, I I I think that masks are a really fun creative opportunity for us that we haven't that we I don't think we've fully leveraged yet
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:24.400]   So I have a lot of boring masks and I realize that I haven't been really thinking hard enough so
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:30.560]   He's going after a little while and and this these masks have little hooks for the rubber bands so you can
[02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:35.760]   You put that over your rate of your surgical mask you need to be a but I could put it over my mask
[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:41.360]   I guess and then the rubber bands hold it in place. This is very interesting and incidentally
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:45.760]   You don't have to have a 3d printer. They have uh, they have partners who will print them off
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:50.480]   For you right so you can scan your face and just and then have have one delivered
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:53.360]   Wonder how much it is
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:56.960]   I don't know, but I I was thinking you can send it to shapeways and have it made out of metal. Oh
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:02.080]   Now we're getting baby. That we're getting baney
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:05.120]   This is cool, man
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:13.920]   Follow-up question are we absolutely sure this isn't actually being produced by a Chinese company that wants to improve their ability to
[02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:16.720]   underneath masks
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:19.920]   It's a
[02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:21.920]   99 from forecast 3d
[02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:24.880]   Is 20 bucks and they have a variety of colors
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:32.560]   And uh, you obviously have to stay deeper than a face mask. I would buy send them the uh, model any tips for doing a bell is 3d
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:35.280]   Model Alex anything. I should know easy
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:41.120]   You literally follow the instructions you open it up like this and it says turn your head this way turn your head that way
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:45.280]   And that's it and it's got a 3d model. It's it's a it's a super easy app to use
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:48.960]   I'm ordering it right now. I hope I get it by next show because I will wear it
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:51.760]   Okay, well you have to do the scan
[02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:54.240]   Yeah, well like that's that takes no time
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:59.840]   No, it doesn't it takes a minute. I used to have this on my uh, they also do a dental thing. I don't know
[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:02.880]   For dental. I saw that I was like, I don't know what that is
[02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:06.240]   You're gonna want want to wash your phone after that. I think
[02:22:06.240 --> 02:22:09.280]   Do not put the phone in your mouth
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:15.600]   Uh, that was fun. Thank you super fun. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely Andy and ako
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:18.320]   Appearances coming up on gbh

[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:25.920]   They've been they've been kind enough to like try to reschedule me
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:31.840]   After my usual time of 1130 because every now and then the mayor or the governor wants to talk about
[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:35.360]   Whatever's going on particularly with the various cataclysm sitting us
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:41.360]   So probably 1130 if not about an hour after that either way go to go to wgbh
[02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:43.360]   News.org
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:48.240]   On friday night or saturday morning. You'll be able to just do a search for my segment and you'll be able to find it
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:52.800]   Very no, I'm sorry. I was scanning my face. Sorry
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:56.000]   I was listening lab if I can elaborate
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.560]   on that
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:02.640]   about these tech segments is that we talk about the issues more about gadgets
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:06.880]   So while I might be speaking a little bit about ww dc
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:12.400]   We're probably going to be talking a lot about about these eu and house judiciary committee
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:15.280]   uh anti-trust
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:22.880]   Investigations also we are considerably considered concerned about facial facial identity facial recognition
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:27.600]   particularly as opposed as how ibm and amazon
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:32.480]   And i m and uh microsoft or as trying to keep out of the 90
[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:36.400]   Look it's me
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:39.040]   Mario look at that
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:42.000]   That's wild
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.200]   You could show it on the uh over the shoulder john can you
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.920]   It even it's because all of these is this part
[02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:51.760]   Maybe I shouldn't have smiled. What do you think? I think it says don't smile
[02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:55.280]   Try it again
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:59.840]   Isn't that what is that you will apple be able to create an an emoji like custom based
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:01.440]   Yeah, I mean wouldn't that be a better animal?
[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:03.920]   You know, I think that make it nice and cartoon like them
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:09.760]   Yeah, exactly has to be yeah, I do think you could take that look you could take it's coming alive
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:12.720]   I am the green to the power
[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:18.240]   I know attention to the man behind the disc. She's louise
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:21.040]   This is scary. All right
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.840]   So, yeah, what you do is you do this you don't smile
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:26.560]   So i'll do it again unless you want to smile the whole time you're wearing your mask
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:28.800]   and then uh
[02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:34.160]   You'd order it online and then the app asks you for your order code you enter it and you're done
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:37.760]   That's pretty darn easy. And then you get this plastic thing
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:42.560]   Which what do you think Alex? You think they'll help go right around the mask? I think so
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:46.880]   I'm more interested in designing ones from the scan, but I think yeah, you're just the mask
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:50.640]   The mask that you have skills you have mad skills. I don't have skills
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:56.080]   But kudos kudos to all of you in a world of people that can't be convinced to wear any mask at all
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:59.520]   You're trying to make the most closest fitting and coolest mask ever
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:06.080]   God bless you. You know what they call that you know what they call that and it's embracing wanting to live embrace it baby
