[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that breaks all the rules
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   and brings you rat holes and spades.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, a great, great cast.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I'm very, very excited.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Alex Lindsey is not with us.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   He's down in Austin and we'll have a report from South by Southwest next week.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   But Merlin Mann of course is here.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Couldn't do the show without Mr. Hot Dog's ladies.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Hello, Marlene.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   He's very quiet for a man who likes hot dogs.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Andy Naco is, I don't know if something's gone wrong with Merlin.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Hello, Madan.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Andy Naco is also here.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Hello, Andy.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I are here.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I are here.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And I is happy to be here.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And his grandma is perfect as befits a man who writes for the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Is that--
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I don't know what it is needed to tape.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Is that Ebert or Siskol's paper?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Well, Siskol's no longer with us, but it is Ebert's paper.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's Ebert's paper.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   All right.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yes.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Siskol wrote for the other one.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Yes, the Chicago Tribune.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Tribune, that's right.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Okay.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Scott Born is also here of the iPod of I Life.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Don't help me.

[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And podcastingtricks.com and aperturetricks.com.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Listen, don't-- we don't even worry.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   There's too many to list.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And many other sites because--
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Because he can.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And--
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I'm so thrilled that Justine is back.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Oh, I should have gotten-- wait a minute.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I'm going to really try and get it right this time.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Azeric.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Azeric?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Yeah, that was right.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Azeric, really?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yes.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Finally, it sunk in a little bit only up at 20 times.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Justine, of course, was with us at our Mac Break Weekly Live
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   from Mac World Expo and has appeared on Mac Break.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But she's also a video blogger par excellence.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I mean, her stuff is so good at a variety of different sites,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   including Mommy-- is it Mommy Pack My Lunch?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Yes.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I love Mommy Pack My Lunch.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And what's the other site where we can see your stuff?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I can't.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   TastyBlogSnack.com.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   That's your blog, TastyBlogSnack.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   That is.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I love that one.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Which recently went from blogger to WordPress.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It did.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   It was an exciting transition.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And Ev-- Ev didn't care when you-- when I told him.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   That's good.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   He was just tapping your own Twitter.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   No, he doesn't care anymore.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   He doesn't care anymore.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah, I don't care.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   So, let me figure out what's wrong with Merlin.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Oh, I'm here.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Now, you were coming out all crazy.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Did you say hi to me already, Leo?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah, you missed that part?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You sounded like you were in some kind of a tunnel.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Maybe it was like cold medicine, uh, sinking in.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   But I'm here.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Hi.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Heck.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So none of us are at South by Southwest.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   What happened?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Merlin, you had a funny post on Twitter about South by Southwest.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   You know the thing about-- it's really hard to keep track of people there.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I hope they brought a camera.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Oh, man.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Geez, Louise.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Twitter should be, like, temporarily renamed, like, where people are seated in Texas this
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   week.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   That is so true.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I am now at the keynote on the left-hand side in row four.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I'm totally eating barbecue while I watch Dan Rather.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Well, thanks.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   No, but it's-- I really want to go.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It sounds like a lot of fun.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   It sounds like some of the talks this year have been fantastic.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   You've never been?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I've never been.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But Jay Allen has gotten great reviews for his and actually--
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Actually, he's not the Dan Rather.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Um, kind of gosh, Jay Allen.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Probably best known for having done Yeoman's work on spam reduction in moveable type.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   He's a--
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I was a little tired.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Until recently, he was working for Six Apart.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   He's a total blog ninja who everybody should hire.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   What is-- I can't find it now.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Maybe it's gone off Twitter, but you said something very funny.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Something like, not going to-- how did you put it?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Not going to South by Southwest again this year as I didn't go again.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Preparing not to go again.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It's become a hobby amongst my friends to rag me for not going to South by Southwest.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Down to the point where they take photos holding up signs that say "Hi, Merlin" to mock me.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Now, Justine, I would have thought would have gone.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Because Justine, like you, Merlin, is really Web 2.0.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   She's really connected.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I'm not actually that connected.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   She knows everybody.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   She does.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It was funny.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I had some people call in to like random podcasts just to tell me what they were doing while they were there.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   How about you, Andy?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Have you ever been to South by Southwest?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I have never been to Southwest.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I first knew it as a place where Robert Rodriguez keeps bragging about how little he spends on his movies.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And so I wasn't interested.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   But now I'm really, really, really hyped up to go someday.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It started as an independent music festival.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Then it became kind of an independent media festival.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   That's when Rodriguez, I guess, started showing up.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But now, one week is devoted to interactive Web 2.0 stuff.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And it's the place to go for Web 2.0.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And I'm pretty sad that I wasn't there.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I feel terrible.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Now...
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's all right.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Did anybody go to Ted?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Nope.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   My invitation for once again, my invitation was lost.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   This is acceptable.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I was, you know, Kevin Rose kind of, I feel like, twisted the knife with me.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Because he said, "So, are you going to Ted?"
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And I said, "No."
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And obviously he's going.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And I'm sure Jadison went, "It's what? Six grand?"
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Yeah, I had the choice between going to Ted or buying five Mac books.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And I decided to...
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   What is Ted?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Somebody explain what Ted is.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I've never been.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It's a place where companies show off cool new ideas and...
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Not just companies, but...
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   It's a...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It's a...
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It's a technology entertainment design.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So it's...
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It is the idea anyway.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And it's been...
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's been around for some time.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The idea was to bring together people from the technology industry, but also from the entertainment
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   industry, from the design industry.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Even politics, Al Gore gave his inconvenient truth speech there, short and version last
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   year.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Bill Clinton was there this year.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So it's really a mix.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Yeah, but the main reason people go is they want to find funding for their idea.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So it's like a demo on steroids, kind of.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Well, they don't talk that part up, but I can tell you that everybody's there looking
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   in the back of the corner of their eye for the next big check writer.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And I get people calling me with those ideas for free.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I don't have to pay six grand to find them.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   We're a bunch of curmudges.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And then there was the Game Designers Conference in San Jose the same week.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   That's just hard to get to everything.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And of course...
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   There was one here, too.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Oh, San Francisco.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Not so good.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Yeah, I think it was San Francisco.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And then to the house.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.600]   We sent Alex to that one, too.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.120]   See, we just sent Alex to everything.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.160]   And then there was the big Munich Auto Show.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   So I couldn't decide.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.800]   That's tough.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.400]   I really couldn't decide.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.000]   So I went to LA instead.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.720]   Dusty's just in my movement.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.000]   The Munich Auto.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.320]   Well, anyway, we...
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.840]   So we are the South by Southwest rejects, but we're here to talk about Macintosh.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.080]   Did you see the new British Mac ads?
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.280]   I got to play one of these for you.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   I'm a Mac.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   And I'm a PC.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.960]   Mac, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.960]   What?
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   Yes.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   Mac, can you please tell me, on average, how long it takes you to make a photo book?
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.440]   Takes a few minutes.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.440]   Really?
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.300]   Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Exhibit A, a hardbound, extremely professional photo
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.720]   book, Mac claims to have made in minutes.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.280]   Care to change your story, Mac?
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.320]   This is not fun on a Mac.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   Is there something about...
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.120]   Well, okay, let me play one that somebody recommended as funny.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   Hello.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120]   I'm a Mac.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120]   And I'm a PC.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   What do you got there, PC?
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.120]   Oh, this.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.360]   In Naughty Step, to an errant, unruly child, this is the ultimate deterrent.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.360]   From what?
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   Unruly errantness.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.520]   Mucky about with pictures and movies and websites.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.880]   No, a spell on the Naughty Step will help them realize that that's not how we treat
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.000]   a proper, grown-up PC.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Such as myself.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.200]   But that's the kind of fun stuff they like, isn't it?
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.000]   He's pointing to the Naughty Step.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.200]   The Naughty Step is always serious.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   Interesting.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.080]   Are there any British Mac ads that don't involve British humor?
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   Apparently.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.600]   I don't even think that's British humor.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   I don't think...
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.040]   The Naughty Step.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.040]   Wow, that's not funny.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.720]   Well, they're funnier visually.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.880]   The great thing about the British Mac ads is that they actually hired a British comedy
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.880]   duo.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   They have the show...
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.600]   For $10,000, I can't say their names, but it's the show called Peep Show.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.840]   So they're famous.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.640]   They're slightly famous, they're famous enough, but the good thing is they know how
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.960]   to play off of each other.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.400]   We're asked in the American ads, it's like the PC guy, the Mac guy.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.440]   It's sort of like when these just shoot Dean Martens, all his scenes on his specials
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.800]   on one day, and then they bring all the rest of the week.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.160]   These two people are actually interacting with each other.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.120]   You know, they say they can't do these ads in Japan because it would be considered so
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.240]   rude of the Mac that it would just be...
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   It's just not acceptable.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.040]   You could have a PC that was a tough guy.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.280]   There was a meme that would be disrespectful.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.320]   Or they can't have the Mac be snottied to the PC because that would be just out of control
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   of the room.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.760]   What would the German Mac be like?
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.680]   That's a PC?
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   No, it's a Mac.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.080]   Do they just slap each other with fish?
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:08.120]   I just want to point out that we have many listeners in Germany, and none of them ever
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.720]   talk like that.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.400]   Do they correct our attempt to pretend we're speaking German?
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   Do you want to...
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.280]   Let me see if I can find a German Mac ad.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.480]   Wait a minute, here we go.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.760]   Alright, get ready for this.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.760]   Hello, it's Benin.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.760]   It's Benin Pitzy.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.480]   It's the first text to the entire class.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.480]   Oh, here.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.920]   In the middle, we have a meeting in the middle of the middle of Microsoft.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.000]   Microsoft office, Microsoft office.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   More jobs.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Oh, my.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Oh, I see.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I'm interested in that fact.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Oh, my.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   It must be your question.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.800]   Microsoft office, he says.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   Oh, my.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:50.200]   You know, it's funny.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.600]   It's Justin Long and John Hodgman.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   Oh, really?
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   Same script.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   You want to see a good bet.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.160]   If you don't have two guys in like black bodysuits, like, like, Muhmann-Shan's.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   Muhmann-Shan's could really make this something.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.240]   To live up to every American stereotype.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.240]   Here's one that...
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.640]   Benin, how?
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   It looks like...
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.560]   It's Hodgman and Long, but it looks like they've got...
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.160]   They've added some graphical elements to it.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   He's got...
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   He's got...
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   I never saw this one.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.760]   He's got signs that say amazing and totally cool the PC does.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.680]   This must be one that was never released in the US.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   Vukoffst.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   Vuk.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   So anyway, that's a...
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.320]   No, I think that's somewhere in the outtakes section of the Apple site.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.760]   So I remember seeing one where the PC is trying to look hip to the back guy.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:44.080]   So he's basically putting all these like... all these like my space type tags on himself.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   You know, it's fun.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.720]   I'm just going to different Mac sites of different countries.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.280]   If you go to dot de slash get a Mac, you can see the ads.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   I'm just going to try...
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.880]   I just found the Japanese Mac first Apple.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.880]   Did you see those ones?
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   Oh, where's that?
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.760]   Um, I'll send you the link.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.800]   Yeah, because I could play it down the line.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.280]   I'll just do Japanese Mac ads.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.280]   Here we go.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.280]   Here we go.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.640]   Yeah, get a Mac at apple.com/jpsusgetamax.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.500]   So I guess they're done.
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.180]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.180]   I missed it. I'm sorry.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.520]   I'm gonna do it again.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.620]   (laughing)
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.440]   - Microsoft Office, he says.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.600]   - What doesn't know what they're saying,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.720]   but it doesn't matter 'cause it's funny.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.480]   Now, these are funny, but in this case.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.800]   - This isn't a giant foam rubber toilet costume.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.160]   (laughing)
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.000]   I don't think they get it.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.800]   Oh, you're right, there is one.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.600]   Anyway, those are the worldwide get a Mac.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.160]   It's anything new in the apple world to advertise?
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.840]   Does anybody receive their Apple?
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.680]   - How many TV?
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.800]   - I'm hits the airman's back.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.640]   - Nine.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.200]   - Nine.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.320]   - I finally broke down and I broke down and ordered one.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.480]   Now that apparently, according to,
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.560]   was it Alex, or who was it from revision three?
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.920]   This is gonna change everything.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.840]   They're saying--
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.680]   (laughing)
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.400]   - Ignatian, Alex, Alex, Albrecht said it's gonna change everything.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.000]   - It was, it was one of the,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.400]   one of the revision three people was just talking at,
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.080]   I wanna say Ted, no, South by Southwest.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.440]   I should prepare for these shows.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.600]   But talk about the, yeah, just, I mean,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.120]   really kind of what a lot of us have been thinking
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.440]   slash hoping all along, the idea that,
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.200]   you know, this is potentially a really--
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.240]   - Wait a minute, all of us talking at you
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.840]   for the last five weeks about this haven't swayed you,
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.120]   but some guy named Alex from Revision Street.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.200]   - Well, no, my thinking is,
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.400]   my thinking is that, you know, I mean,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.360]   with The Merlin Show, this is something we'd like to--
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.200]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.320]   - Like to service this vertical,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.240]   and I figure I should least, you know,
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.400]   know how it works and try it.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.080]   You know, I'll try it.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.600]   I hope they update the firmware, so, you know,
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.320]   just for my final rant about this,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.480]   that it doesn't do divx, I think it's still kind of crazy.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.840]   But, you know, maybe someday, I'm sure it'll be cool.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.760]   And, you know, we buy enough crap on the iTunes store
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.800]   that it'll probably be worth our while, so.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.480]   - According to, and also rip your stuff in a quick time,
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.280]   so, according to Kringley, who's notoriously bad
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.000]   at predicting things, every Mac to be released in 2007,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.760]   I guess it going forward in 2000,
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.120]   oh, I guess they haven't released any Macs yet, have they?
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.280]   Will, at some point, included chipset
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.320]   that offloads the task of rendering video
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.760]   from the CPU guaranteeing a minimum level of quality
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.560]   even on the slower, cheaper Macs,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.280]   but it will also allow you to be a PVR
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.400]   and share H.264, save and share H.264.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.160]   Interesting.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.000]   - Now, what do you think of that?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.240]   - See, I don't even have a TV,
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.760]   so I have a plan on getting one.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.000]   - No, this is the way to watch TV.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.120]   This is how I watch TV, is I,
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.160]   oh, you mean you don't have a set at all?
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.400]   - We have one, but honestly, since I have moved
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.040]   into this house, we've never turned it on
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   maybe like once to watch the movies.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.880]   And that was it.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.320]   - But you watch on the computer, you watch stuff.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.320]   - Yeah.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.160]   - Well, that's okay.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.840]   So you don't need Apple. - Alex doesn't have a TV either, Leo.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.040]   - Well, that's good.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.880]   So wait a second. - But didn't you order
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880]   an Apple TV?
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.560]   - Yeah, but he's got a Tom Tom
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.560]   and he doesn't have a car either, so what the heck?
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.720]   - I'm confused.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.280]   - Now, what's the size of your largest computer screen?
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.120]   Justine.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.320]   - A 19-inch, which is fun for me.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.560]   - Okay, that's fine.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.000]   I mean, I still have TVs in my house.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.680]   I'm still terrified of the switchover to digital
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.400]   because it means that to watch anything,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.600]   anywhere in my house, I'm gonna have to get digital cable
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.760]   wired in my office and in the kitchen
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.880]   and in the living room and everywhere else.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.160]   I mean, I watch too many movies
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.760]   to use computers for all my TV watching.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.640]   - That's true.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.160]   - We did an interesting interview
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.160]   with a scientist named Smar from Cal IT2
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.360]   which is the University of California's
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.080]   kind of Media Lab Advanced Research Division.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.960]   And he was saying that, you know, HD TVs,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.880]   the TVs that we're used to,
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.960]   are gonna be past eight in just a couple of years
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.480]   because the standard is now moving,
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.720]   those are called 2K sets.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.000]   Their standard is now moving to 4K sets
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.880]   with the red camera that Alex is always talking about on Twim
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.080]   which is a 4K camera and inexpensive 4K camera
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.800]   and high speed fiber to the home,
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.520]   which he also thinks is gonna happen the next, say,
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.240]   certainly by the end of the decade.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.000]   You're gonna have super high-def stuff
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.760]   and so your TV is really gonna be obsolete.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.560]   But no, instead of obsolete,
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.320]   think of being able to buy a 40-inch set
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.280]   for less than $400 now,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.840]   which is really gonna have to be the ideal
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.960]   if everybody's gonna be adopting HD now.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.360]   Because those little set top boxes
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.040]   are gonna convert your Gold Star 19-in-ure,
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.000]   they're really gonna fly for most people.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.140]   - You know, I don't see people adopting 4K sets, Leo,
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.080]   because, you know, while they're gonna be available
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.040]   to the high end, think about this.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.520]   If you look at what digital quality means,
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.320]   what digital quality means is we dumb things down.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.840]   People aren't looking for better quality,
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.800]   looking for cheaper, easier quality.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.360]   You know, like where MP3s are now considered the standard.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.320]   You know, all this stuff is gonna be
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.080]   movie compressed if it comes from cable or satellite.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.280]   I don't know, I don't think that's accurate.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.160]   - That's an interesting point.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.000]   Although Hollywood has agreed as the 4K standard
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.280]   is the standard going forward for film.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.640]   But see, it doesn't have to come in over the cable
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.160]   or over the antenna if it comes,
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.920]   if you have gigabit internet access.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.760]   - Yeah, but if you look at the penetration,
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.120]   a gigabit in ethernet.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.800]   - Well, this requires that, obviously.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.520]   I mean, this is, we're talking,
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.640]   maybe, okay, in a decade, it's probably optimistic.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.240]   10 years, give it 10 years.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.120]   - That's more realistic.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.960]   - Yeah.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.920]   But it is, I think the next coming standard.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.960]   Now, he says this is gonna make telepresence
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.320]   just a matter of course, because it's so vivid,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.000]   that it's indistinguishable from real life
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.160]   if you're looking at it, you know, across the room.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.160]   - Well, then we're--
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.800]   - It means an end of a career for you and me, Leo.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.240]   - Oh, we're dead, me.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.840]   The Merlin Show will be radio, I predict.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.160]   - Catch or submit with a wig.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.480]   (laughing)
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.680]   - Guess I'm gonna have to buy a TV sometime soon.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.840]   (laughing)
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.040]   - See, it's getting better, Justin.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.320]   See, Justin would look, see, it's Justin's world.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.160]   That's the truth.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.000]   - Yeah.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.960]   - You know, it is funny, 'cause what you're describing,
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.520]   though, Justin, is, I mean, I feel like the analog
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.000]   to that also is, I feel like I'm meeting more and more people
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.200]   now, young people who aren't even using email.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.520]   This is a funny one for me.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.640]   Everything they do is like, when we did the Mac break thing
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.240]   at the place where you were at,
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.880]   you were I aming the whole freaking time.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.080]   - I'm not, I'm sorry.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.360]   - No, no, no, no, I didn't mean it that way.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.360]   Just in the sense that I think a lot of people
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.080]   who are a good deal younger than me are,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.160]   that has really come to replace email
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.560]   for a lot of their communication, and that's, you know,
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.320]   in the same way that I would escalate an email
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.200]   into a phone call, I think a lot of people
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.920]   might escalate, I am into an email.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.840]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.760]   - Yeah, that's very true.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.840]   - Is that how it works for you?
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.960]   - Yeah, I think so, because really I don't email
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.560]   as much anymore.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.840]   I never really thought of it until right the second,
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.680]   I do text message instead of send an email.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.160]   - That's very interesting.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.360]   So email's too slow for people under 25, I guess.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.880]   - I think so.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.440]   - Where would you say the age dividing line is?
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.960]   - You know, I'm not sure, because my mom,
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.640]   she always text messages me as opposed to email or call.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.480]   - There you go, it might be a state of mind,
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.080]   not an age.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.160]   - I think the big difference is also having a keyboard.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.840]   I mean, you know, just--
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.400]   - On your phone, you mean?
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.200]   - Yeah, people send you stuff, and it's like,
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.240]   fricking T9, forget it, you know?
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.560]   - Yeah, that's true. - LOL, raffle,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.200]   raffle, raffle, I can't, yeah, I can't.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.080]   - Justin, you still use the Trio 700, is that what you mean?
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.400]   - Yeah, I'm still using that.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.720]   - Maybe I have to get a new phone.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.760]   - You do, it's called the iPhone.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.720]   - No, I don't think the iPhone is gonna be the slow,
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.280]   I don't think it's that easy to type on.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   David Pogue didn't think so.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.680]   - I liked it.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.280]   - Did you type on it, Andy?
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.840]   - Ooh, Andy, you played with one?
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.720]   - Yeah, I had about a half hour with one.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.360]   I actually found it a lot easier to use
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.320]   than the Trio keyboard.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.080]   I mean, I absolutely despise the Trio keyboard.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.120]   I think it's absolutely unusable.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.760]   I can't grow my fingernails out
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.840]   of like Howard Hughes and sharpened him into points
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.240]   so I can actually use tiny little buttons.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.160]   - Pretty picture, Andy, thank you.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.000]   - That's good, that's really cool.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.720]   - That's a really evolved clause for you.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.360]   - Also, you don't want to open Andy's closet door,
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   there's a lot of jars in there.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.880]   - But now, Andy, I'm guessing looking at you,
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.840]   you probably don't have spelt fingers.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.680]   I would imagine that you'd be more like me,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.000]   the sausage finger type of the scale.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.280]   - I have he-manly Russian fingers, of course.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.640]   - And you had no trouble?
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.680]   - The buttons, I had absolutely no trouble
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.960]   with the iPhone keyboard.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.320]   The number one, the keys themselves
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.200]   are physically bigger, they're better spaced.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.800]   Also, it's smart enough to take really good guesses
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.400]   as to what you intended to hit.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.200]   I think a lot of people, for a lot of people,
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.160]   it's gonna be a deal breaker
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.000]   that you don't get that tactile response
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.600]   underneath your fingers, but I wonder if that will be
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.920]   even just offset by people who, like me,
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.040]   are just so totally thrown away
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.820]   by every other tactile keyboard they've used.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.040]   - Wow, I'm really excited to try it.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.880]   That's for sure.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.720]   - It really is great.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.840]   I mean, it's a great little thing.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.360]   Everything you want to do intuitively
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.120]   is actually the way you're actually supposed to use it.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.360]   It's like handling a movie prop, it's wonderful.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.720]   - Well, it's not your, I mean, I'm just curious
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.640]   as long as we got you talking about this,
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.440]   so I get you've probably written about this elsewhere,
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.400]   but what was your overall impression of playing with it?
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   - I was really excited by it because I'm not a big fan
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.840]   of animation and glossy buttons and all this flash,
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.760]   unless, number one, the damn thing works.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.160]   If I have to actually pause to wait for the user interface
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.320]   to catch up with my scroll command, it's no good to me.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.480]   Secondly, all this new languages
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.880]   that you're putting into the user interface
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.920]   have to make sense for what you want to do,
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.320]   but they've totally expanded the iPod concept
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.880]   to the concept of a phone.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.000]   Again, your first intuition
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.360]   about how you're supposed to do something
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   turns out almost always to be exactly the way you do it.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.720]   It feels, there is no tactile response
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   underneath your fingertips, but you almost imagine
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.240]   that there is because the interface
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.920]   is so responsive to your touch.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.560]   - Could you turn on a little click sound,
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.120]   or I mean, imagine they had some sound to that, right?
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.840]   - If there was, I did not turn it on.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   Remember this was back in January.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.760]   There were a whole bunch of buttons that led to JPEGs,
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.680]   as opposed to functional notifications.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.880]   - JPEGs, that's true.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.720]   - Yes, they got it.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.960]   - What was it?
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.200]   - I desperately wanted to see what the notes feature was like,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.000]   so I was hoping, come on, come on, man,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.880]   there's gotta be some way I can open up a word file,
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.200]   or open up a text file, and I'm just clicking, clicking,
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   clicking, I'm like, oh my God, I've had it for five minutes,
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.880]   I've already broken it, and then the VP said,
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.360]   no, you're actually trying to try and activate a picture there,
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.520]   we don't have to have that finish.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.920]   - This demo is over.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.760]   - Sorry.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   - I wonder how hard it would be to have something like
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.600]   the, I forgot what you call it, the force,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   what do you call it in a Wii,
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.880]   and then we moat, you know, where there would be a little bit.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.360]   - Of course you got like a--
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.680]   - Yeah, like a little vibration thing,
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.880]   it could be kind of cool if you had a way to like,
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.920]   just have a subtle little bit of clicking, yeah.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.400]   - Is it more than a type to vibrate?
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.000]   - Well, I'm just thinking it could be very subtle,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.560]   but that would be one more--
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.480]   - Like a mile, but memorable electrical shock
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.680]   to teach you not to push the wrong button again.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.120]   - I think it was Sony that got sued by immersion.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.560]   Immersion invented a very, I remember showing it
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.000]   on the screen saver, it was a very cool force feedback mouse
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.360]   that did exactly that when you went over the border of a window
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.120]   that was like you were going over a rubber band
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.680]   with a little twang, just a slightest feeling,
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.280]   but it actually added hugely to the interface.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.240]   - I'm convinced that's, I mean, the rattle,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.720]   but I'm convinced that this is one thing
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.520]   that has made the Wii so totally fun,
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.280]   is that, I mean, that changes everything.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.680]   When you hit the ball with the tennis racket,
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.120]   you really feel like you're hitting it.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.320]   I could really see that becoming something that--
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.440]   - Merlin's a Wii maniac, do you play Wii?
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.440]   - No, no, my, everybody's better than me, Leo.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.640]   - But you have Wii parties, the Oscar,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.440]   when you have the people come over to see the Academy Awards,
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.840]   you are playing Wii.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.760]   - You have to be under 35 to get into those, apparently.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.360]   - No, he's 40.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.600]   Justine, do you play with a Wii?
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.680]   - I have used it in the random stores,
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.080]   but I haven't bought one, if I do,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.320]   it'll probably ruin my life.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.120]   - So you have to be over 25.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.080]   - You need a TV, you gotta have a TV, right?
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.360]   - Yeah, a TV, what am I gonna do?
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.680]   I can't do it.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.520]   - I can't use that.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.440]   - Hey, speaking of rat holes, I wanna thank Paul Minshelf
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.800]   for sending us the brand new rat hole music.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, here it is.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.840]   More than just a tingle, it's a song.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.840]   ♪ Rat hole, forty three folders of rat holes ♪
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   ♪ The weeping, my breaking rat hole ♪
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   ♪ Totally off-toughing rat holes ♪
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.240]   - And we welcome you back to the Macbreak Lounge,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.480]   where it's for the hanging.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.760]   That was superb.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.000]   - That was amazing.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.520]   - 40, did you hear the lyrics?
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.160]   43 folders of rat holes?
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.000]   - I love it.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.440]   I love it. (laughs)
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.680]   - It's a virus, Leo.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.520]   I'm dragging you out now. - It's gonna create
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.040]   an earworm now for me.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.880]   I won't be able to get that out of my ear.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.720]   - You were.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.920]   - The only way to get an earworm out of your head,
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.360]   Scott, is to go and listen to Joni Mitchell.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.240]   - You know, it's interesting because in fact,
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.840]   now the rat hole is a rat hole.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.280]   So we've kind of-- - It's the cure worse
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.280]   than the disease, though.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.120]   - Sweet.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.440]   (laughs)
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.040]   - Oh my God, you're so insane.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.440]   Did you just rat Joni Mitchell in front of me?
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.280]   - Uh, all right, I can't do this.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.600]   - Okay, well, me. - You're still going down, buddy.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.240]   - Leo, come on, don't say that about Joni Mitchell.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.320]   She is an American goddess. (laughs)
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.160]   - She's totally not. - She's gonna eat.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.520]   - That's fine. - Oh, annoying.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.560]   - She can't sing on key, though.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.080]   - Okay, let's move on. - Let's just leave Joni Mitchell.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.920]   - Oh, I love Joni.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.840]   You know what, I love Joni Mitchell.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.520]   I do like-- - I was, I'm very pleased
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.600]   that someone did that for us, Leo.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.800]   - I have something for you. - I want to say again.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.120]   His name is Paul Minshaw.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.520]   He's done other Jingle's force for the Daily Gizwiz
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.460]   and he's very, very talented.
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.480]   By the way, I have a bootleg you might like
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.200]   of Joni Mitchell and James Taylor Live at the BBC.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.960]   - Oh, really? - That is from back in the day.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.720]   From back in the day when they were still dating,
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.800]   it's fan-tastic. - Oh, man.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.120]   - I will give you a comment.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.960]   - I would love to hear that.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   You know, if you guys got the cable TV or the satellite,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   there's a show on the BBC. - There's a TV seat.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.800]   BBC and Markdown. - I do.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.560]   I only have, I'm sorry.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.400]   - No, go ahead.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.680]   This is just another raffle, please jump in.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.920]   - I'll understand, I only have cable,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.960]   so I could have cable internet.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.160]   - Wait a minute, you have cable, but you don't have a TV.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.320]   - We do have a TV, but it doesn't even look at all.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.400]   - You have I am, but you don't use email.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.920]   All right, all right, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.920]   Here's a test, MySpace, MySpace, Facebook, or Verb?
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.120]   - Verb.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.640]   - Yeah, that's what I thought.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.640]   They're all going to Verb now.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.200]   - I hope so, because I love it.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.160]   - It's great. - Isn't it great?
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.600]   - I know, I know, I sent you an invite a while back.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.480]   - You did, and I ignored you, I'm sorry.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.680]   - You did, I cried.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.520]   - I thought, oh, this is these young people,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.480]   I can't keep up with them.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.440]   But, you know, MySpace was the big thing,
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.960]   and now it's, I knew it was over when Abby,
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.320]   my 14-year-old, so it'd be 15, closed her MySpace account.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.800]   She went to Facebook, so I followed her to Facebook.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.480]   You know what's really sad?
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   In December, Yahoo offered Facebook $1 billion,
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.960]   and according to Mike Errington,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.480]   they were willing to go to $1.6 billion.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.360]   Facebook turned them down, they wanted $2 billion.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.960]   - Oh, geez. - And now, of course.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.480]   - And the guy who made that decision
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.400]   is the fellow you meet when you go to McDonald's
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.560]   who says, "Would you like fries with that?"
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.480]   - He's 24 years old, he started Facebook
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.560]   while a sophomore at Harvard,
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.320]   and obviously didn't learn a thing at Harvard,
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.800]   he turned him down, and I have to think that
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.160]   it's, that might've been his last offer,
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.840]   'cause here comes verb, and Facebook looks--
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.760]   - Verbi, it looks pretty.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.280]   - Verbi, you're looking at it for the first time now?
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.400]   - Well, I don't know, because Facebook is now offering gifts,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.120]   and I've been buying a lot of those, so--
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.080]   - Oh, they're trying to bribe you.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.400]   - I think so, well, we mean half of it goes to cancer,
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.560]   so, you know--
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.360]   - Half your gift goes to cancer?
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.000]   - Four against it. - It's your cancer.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.200]   - Oh, again, it's a cure cancer.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   - What do they give you?
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.720]   (laughing)
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.880]   - Giving you a pack of the charted.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.480]   - Talk about your viral marketing, God.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   (laughing)
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.640]   - Well, I think they did the cigarettes during the war,
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.200]   you know. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.680]   - First one's free, kid.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.040]   - So what about the kids?
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.880]   - I think it's for you to talk.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.480]   - I think verb is beautiful, I have absolutely no desire
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.120]   to be on yet another social networking site,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.960]   but man, I thought verb looked fantastic.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.480]   - Now you should join this one.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.960]   - Has it been easy to modify, Justin?
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   Pretty easy to trick it out, yeah?
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.040]   - The examples of what people have done show you
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.720]   that you can do basically anything.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.000]   - So here's my question,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.920]   why haven't we got something like that on .Mac?
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.680]   'Cause nobody wants it.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.520]   I don't know why.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.080]   - I really don't use .Mac either.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.800]   - But I'm just saying you don't use .Mac
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.400]   because what you want isn't there.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.200]   Apple would be smart. - It's a good start.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.680]   - Apple would be smart to say,
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.880]   hey, there's a reason to spend 100 bucks with this.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.800]   We're gonna give you a social networking site that rocks.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.160]   - There were rumors, again, always with the rumors.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.840]   There were rumors floating around last week
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.840]   that there were, 'cause of course,
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.720]   anytime anything in Apple goes down for any reason,
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.640]   all the rumors start,
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.440]   that there's about to be some kind of big activity.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.920]   So there were all these rumors drifting around last week
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.760]   about how we're gonna all get all this extra disk space
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.920]   and all this new functionality.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.280]   And of course it didn't happen.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.280]   I agree with you, Scott.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.600]   I mean, I think they need to do something with .Mac.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.760]   - It's 90 bucks for basically sync service, right?
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.760]   I mean-- - That's all I use.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.800]   That's really, I mean, you know what?
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.960]   I use the web dev, but it's certainly,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.080]   it's a commodity at this point.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.120]   Web dev was really hot three years ago.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.240]   I mean, you know, the web dev functionality was, you know,
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.040]   not something you could get easily three years ago.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.320]   And now I mean, it's how hard is it, you know?
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.240]   - Well, I just-- - Not hard.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.000]   - I just think that what's really gonna happen is that
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.480]   I don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.200]   - Somehow magically .Mac ended up in my shopping cart
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.520]   when I bought my MacBook Pro and I'm not sure how.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.760]   - Yeah, I paid you that. - But I paid for it.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.160]   I'm like, "Do you look at you, you'll sneaky people?"
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.480]   - Oh, that was sneaky.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.120]   - Oh, that's interesting. - Yeah, he's like,
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   "You can have this for free."
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.000]   And then I got home, I'm like, "What is this?"
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.040]   - Do you do anything with it?
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.080]   - I checked my email three times.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.120]   - I pay for .Mac every year 'cause I use,
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.720]   as I said, for the sync and for, I do use it for backup.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.640]   Do I use it as kind of a central folder
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.520]   where I can copy everything.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.040]   - Oh, so you use backup.app?
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.600]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.560]   - That's broken permanently, isn't it?
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.680]   - No, it's been fixed recently, I think.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.920]   - They just had an update about what a week ago,
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.760]   two weeks ago.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.520]   - Yeah, I gave up trying to get it to work
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.720]   two years ago. - And your crew.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.280]   - Yeah, I really wish that .Mac were the sort of service
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.520]   that you could just sort of flat out recommend to people.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.840]   There are a lot of people for whom
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.200]   it's just a really great idea,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.720]   particularly if they are real newbies
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.480]   with photo sharing and movie sharing.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.080]   It's a lot easier just to be able to tell them
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.400]   to click on this one button,
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.320]   the service will take care of everything for you,
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.880]   as opposed to saying, "Well, I'll spit it out
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.640]   "to a quick time, then go to this hosting service,
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.920]   "and set up your MySpace page and put it onto YouTube."
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.720]   I mean, my autostel is not gonna figure that out.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   I always renew .Mac journalistic reasons aside,
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.960]   because I really like AppleScripting the iDISK.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.640]   It's really, really easy when I have lots of different
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.000]   problems to solve to write an AppleScript
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.120]   that will simply take certain things
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.080]   I want to make persistent and put them on the iDISK
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.120]   so I can put them in my office server
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.880]   and put them in other places.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.840]   But once again, everybody seems to have their own
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.240]   different reason for using .Mac,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.640]   and there's not that one, you know, praise God,
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.800]   praise God past the iMac.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   - It's useful.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.560]   - I think it's useful just to have the iDISK folder
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.560]   on your desktop and iCopy files there,
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.200]   'cause I have many Macs, and so if you only had one Mac,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   I don't know how useful.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.080]   In fact, .Mac would be not recommended for a single Mac.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.480]   If you had multiple Macs, it's useful.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.560]   - I do like the syncing. - I do like the syncing.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.240]   - Good.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.080]   - No, no, I'm just gonna say,
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.160]   I think the syncing is fantastic,
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.560]   but I mean, you know, I'm one of the people
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.320]   who's donated to the fun to try and go out
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.040]   and make a replacement for .Mac,
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.200]   'cause it just seems like with a little,
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.440]   I mean, you could open source something,
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.120]   it seems to me, that could really just use kind of a raw
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.160]   shared hosting account and could emulate almost all
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.800]   that functionality for less money and more power.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.480]   It's just somebody just needs to go do it.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.360]   And it's crazy that Apple's not the one doing it,
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.200]   'cause they should be.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.240]   - There is a contest online, much the same way as the,
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.120]   you know, boot windows on Mac contest to recreate .Mac.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.680]   I think he's got quite a big prize fund,
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.400]   but I don't think he's getting anywhere close to it.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.520]   It's web dev, but you've gotta get,
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.840]   I sync working with it and that's non-trivial,
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.080]   and I think it's not easy.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.280]   Let me see if I can find that URL.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.640]   - It's not Mac challenge, I think you're thinking of, yeah.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.000]   I put it in 150 bucks,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.200]   I was like, I'd love to see somebody replace this.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.320]   - Justine, what were you gonna say for that,
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.640]   Marlon cut you off there?
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   - Oh, that's okay, now I was gonna say
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.520]   that I used to always use the SpyMac disc,
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.400]   as opposed to .Mac, I don't know if you guys ever used that.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.200]   You know, I have a SpyMac account and I haven't used it.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.440]   Tell me what the benefit of that is, as opposed to .Mac.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   - I think it's pretty much the same thing.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.720]   - It's a backup disc?
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.960]   - Yeah, that's basically it.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.880]   - But you can't use iSync,
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.360]   you wouldn't sync iCal or address book or anything.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.880]   - I think they do have a sync with it.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.720]   - Really?
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.000]   - I haven't used it in a long time, but--
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.520]   - You know, ages ago they sent me an account,
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.560]   and this is an example of,
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.000]   I really should pay more attention to my mail.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.840]   (laughing)
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.880]   I am me from now on, oh God, please, I didn't say that.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.800]   - Yeah, good luck.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.600]   - Yeah, how long? - 3.9 IMs per second
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.520]   for Leolipul.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.720]   Twitter's bad enough.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.960]   Oh my gosh.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.200]   I'll have to try, so you use SpyMac,
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.440]   you don't have a .Mac account, but you use SpyMac.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.120]   - I do have a .Mac account, but I do have SpyMac also.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.840]   - And you use SpyMac? - I was one of my original,
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.560]   I haven't used it much anymore, but I used to.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.000]   It was like one of my first Mac websites that I joined.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.400]   - Yeah. - It was exciting.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.160]   - I forgot about them, but you know what?
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.280]   - Yeah. - They're good there.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.120]   They're still around.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.600]   - They are. - Well, the .Mac,
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   configuration, if you use the Apple Mail app,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.320]   makes it worthwhile, and I know it's not the best
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.280]   mail app around, but it works.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.600]   - It is my Mac. - I made for the check,
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.760]   which is kind of nice, right?
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.240]   I mean, you can use-- - I'm able to check my mail
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.000]   on the road, and the other thing I use it for all the time
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.920]   is I frequently have to upload shows for people
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.600]   to deal with, do stuff with, and so I can just go
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.800]   to my public folder really easy, and you don't have to mess
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.080]   around with creating FTP accounts for everybody.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.600]   It's, for that alone, I'd pay the hundred bucks.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.080]   - Yeah, you can't beat the fact that it's just
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.440]   right installed inside the Finder menu bar.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.400]   - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, that's true.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.160]   - Yeah, I think that's probably what happens is
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.240]   it's just the default, and people get in their bag
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.560]   like just eating it, it's just kind of,
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.320]   you just end up using it. - It's like,
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.760]   "Guess I should use this then, I just paid
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.320]   "hundred bucks for it." - Yeah.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   - Thank you. - Would you like to have
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.760]   supersized that for only $0.19 more?
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.120]   - But here's a tip, folks. - No.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.200]   - If you really want to buy it, go to Amazon,
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.720]   'cause it's cheaper there. - Really?
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.920]   - That's right, 70 bucks, or 80 bucks, yeah.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.440]   - Yeah, it's a lot cheaper. - It's 79 bucks,
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.840]   if you buy it on Amazon, - Yeah.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.400]   - And so why spend the extra 20?
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.360]   - Now, we've talked before about getting Google Calendar
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.680]   to work in the same way, and it's not out yet.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:25.800]   Has anybody beta-tested Spanning Sync yet?
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.920]   Because there is an open beta test.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.960]   It's blog.spanningsync.com, you can download it.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.600]   They reopen the beta test, yeah, but you know,
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.200]   they scare me away, because they say,
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.480]   you know, it's a beta, and they say,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.280]   you know, back up your data, there are known bugs
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   that can corrupt both ICal and Google calendars.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.200]   You could list everything. - Oh, no.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.320]   - And it kind of scared me away,
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.600]   but I'm excited about this.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.800]   This would make Google Calendar, your centralized calendar,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.600]   and automatically sync it with ICal,
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.840]   which I think would be very handy.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.120]   - Yeah, it would be perfect. - Yeah, it would be perfect.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.760]   - It's a nice idea, but boy, that just really increases
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.880]   the Iq factor for me, putting any kind of personal information
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.160]   on a central server, especially when there's a web interface
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.000]   to it.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   I love the idea of being able to sync everything
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.640]   to something central.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   I love the idea of having my addresses and everything else
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.680]   synchronized to it as well, but man,
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.080]   if I can't change my password every single day,
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.560]   and unless I did that, I would be really, really worried
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.080]   about who's seeing what I'm doing and what I'm talking with.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.680]   - You know, it happened to me, there's a calendar,
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.400]   a very good, I think, the best calendar
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:36.360]   better than Google calendars, 30 boxes at 30aboxes.com.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.480]   Just really age-ax-y and slick and beautiful.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   And everything can subscribe to an ICal calendar.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.560]   If you publish your calendar, you can subscribe to it.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.800]   So I did that.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.600]   And then I got notes from several people saying,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.120]   "Oh, you're having a massage today."
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.120]   And I thought, "Oh, no."
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   - Oh, I don't know if I want that.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.240]   For some reason, despite the fact that I hadn't shared it,
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.960]   it was being shared globally.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:02.800]   - Wow.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.760]   - You're like, "Miss Helga, your legs seem somewhat
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.120]   "hairy today."
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.960]   - It was not--
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.280]   - Huh?
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.960]   It was not what I wanted.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.920]   Let's put it this way.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.280]   - Is it Helga your masseuse?
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.120]   - Helga, no.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.440]   - No, not Helga.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.800]   - Franz is my most--
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.640]   - Franz.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.480]   - There's a funny phenomenon to all of this, though,
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:28.640]   that if you, I've had such an ongoing rant about ICal
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.960]   and kind of wishing that it would modernize a little bit,
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.640]   the funny thing is for so many of the applications
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.760]   that we use, ICal becomes--
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.640]   - Well, it does okay.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.680]   I mean, the funny part is, though, that ICal has become
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.440]   kind of, not the lingo franca precisely,
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.640]   but it's become the hub for getting into and out
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.800]   of all kinds of different places.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.200]   - But that's because it does use an industry standard.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.560]   The ICal, you know, this is confusing,
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.840]   'cause the name of the program is ICal,
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.400]   but there is just like there's VCF,
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.000]   there's an ICal ICS standard that is not apples,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.840]   that is, and that's why Google works
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.680]   with it and everything else works with it.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:03.320]   You know, 30 bucks, have you tried 30 bucks as my own?
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.160]   - Yeah, I tried it when it very first came out
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.000]   and I hadn't gone back.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.200]   You know what's funny is what you described,
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.800]   is that's the kind of stuff that wakes me up.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.000]   - Yeah, it sure is.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.200]   - And I would, the thing is I really like,
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.800]   well, you know, I should say disclosure,
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.520]   I'm an advisor for Stickit,
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.400]   but Stickit has that functionality,
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.720]   actually a very, a little known feature inside of Stickit
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.320]   that Rails is gonna kill me for mentioning.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.040]   You can output an ICS of pretty much any tag.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.400]   - I have to say, you can stick it more.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.000]   You know, the last time we talked,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.040]   we had Rails on Net at night.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.640]   It wasn't doing the best job of interpreting
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.040]   what I was saying, and I think it's,
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.600]   I should try it again, because I,
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.720]   - Well, I think it's definitely a food.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.760]   - But what I like about though,
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.840]   is you can make these kind of ad hoc calendars
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.360]   and spit them out, and I would love
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.200]   to be able to do everything through,
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.040]   you know, I use Kinkles, giving things done also,
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.760]   you know, for my tasks up.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.400]   But anyway, but because I come,
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.800]   - I don't wanna have 15 different
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.160]   getting things done applications either.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.320]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.320]   - Right?
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.960]   - Shouldn't I just, you're right.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.560]   - You said you need one that manages,
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.840]   you need one that manages all 15 then later.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.240]   (laughing)
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.640]   - Well, I talked about, because,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.440]   you kind of want this Unix-like approach
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.240]   of having the best tool for each one of these things,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   but you're right, you don't wanna run around
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.720]   doing eight different apps.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.240]   - Yeah, but that's actually kind of the point.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.880]   I mean, I call is not the most sophisticated
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.280]   calendar application out there,
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.680]   but the fact that it will hook up to an interface
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.800]   with just about everything that you have
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.360]   on the Mac experience, makes it pretty much invaluable.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.000]   I mean, that's the whole reason why,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.120]   like Freebase is getting so much ink this week,
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.640]   because it's not so much that it's this great database app,
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.080]   it's just that the idea of here is one collective soup
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.680]   for all information anywhere,
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.560]   everywhere that every, all kinds of different,
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.520]   new applications can then pull from.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.560]   - Wait a minute, okay, we're going real fast,
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.520]   let me give you some links.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.880]   Stick it is free, it's STI, double k it.com.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.440]   And Freebase, are you talking about the alkaloid
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.960]   made out of cocaine that you would,
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.120]   with hydrochloride salt or?
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.760]   - Is that part of your massage?
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.600]   Is that next to 80?
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.440]   - Wait a minute, no, I'm sorry.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.640]   I went to Wikipedia by accident.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.240]   - They are looking for narcotics scientists.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.800]   What is Freebase?
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.320]   I don't know what that is.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.440]   - There's this new product by a company called MetaWeb,
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.840]   I think they actually getting back to TED,
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.080]   I mean, I think it was a big demo in TED,
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.920]   where the idea is to have a free resource
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.000]   for web-based content,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.200]   where if you've got a database of anything that's useful,
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.560]   you can put it up onto Freebase,
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.200]   it will be a modified open license,
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.360]   it costs nothing to serve it,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.320]   if you're not charging people to access it.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.000]   And so later on, if somebody wants to create a map,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.800]   someone wants to enhance their mapping application
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.920]   to tell you not only where you are,
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.040]   but also to hook into Flickr's photo geotag database,
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.520]   and then show you, well, here's what the neighborhood
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.640]   looks like around that hotel, or around that comic book shop,
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.880]   because everything is in this big shared soup
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.920]   on Freebase, it's available to everybody to exploit.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.000]   - I like it, now it's very alpha, it said.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.920]   I'm reading Tim O'Reilly's article about it from TED.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.960]   He says, "I need to be invited into it."
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.160]   - Yeah, it's, oh, you have to get invited?
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.000]   - Yeah.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.560]   - At this point, still if you get invited,
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.320]   and it's also not completely unique.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.880]   There's this thing called,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.280]   if you ever played with a double DB?
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.120]   - No.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.280]   - It's another online database,
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.720]   and this is more of an application sort of solution
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.600]   than an information sort of solution.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.440]   The idea of Freebase is not to give you a database application,
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.840]   but once again, to have a big wood stock,
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.520]   mud-covered, hippie-fest,
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.680]   of free-for-making for every little bit.
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.920]   - Well, it's like a library,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.080]   it's these sort of contributing code to a library,
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:30.920]   that kind of thing.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.760]   - Oh, it's more like what do you--
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.600]   - Kind of like that, right.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.240]   Where the structure is being,
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.840]   the structure is not necessarily being imposed on the stuff.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.200]   Anybody who has access to Freebase
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.240]   can then write up, pull data out of it,
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.560]   and basically mash it up
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.240]   with any other piece of information they want.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.720]   - Can you send me an invite, Mr. Annie Nachon?
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.200]   - I might be able to do that,
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.120]   depending on if they actually prove by invite up,
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.760]   but it's a queue for a bit of for a while now.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.640]   - I've just given them my address.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.480]   - So, listen-- - I love the invites.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.920]   - Yeah, but isn't it a smart way to market that?
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.880]   That's what verb got attention,
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.400]   because it only re-soulant in public.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.240]   It's brilliant.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.360]   All right, so this has become the Web 2.0 show,
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.400]   even though we didn't go to South by Southwest.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.480]   - Yay!
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.920]   - Be thoughtful and glossy already.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.800]   - Who needs to go to South by Southwest?
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.400]   This show is South by Southwest.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.560]   In recording form.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.400]   The guy, by the way,
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.000]   as an Alex Albrecht who was talking,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.640]   was Jay Ailes and the CEO.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.480]   - I'm sorry, that's what I meant.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.320]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.800]   - Actually, that was the panel I was supposed to be on
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.160]   with Jay and Nicole Carrico,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.600]   and Tom Merritt put that together from CNET,
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.080]   and I had a bail at the last minute, so.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.620]   I'm sorry I missed that.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:41.160]   - It is in the free part of Texas though, that's the good--
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.680]   - Austin is free?
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.200]   - That's in the free part of Texas.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.040]   - What's the unfree part of Texas?
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.200]   - We won't get into that.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.360]   - All I know is Fort Worth is where the web is.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.720]   - The best begins, that's all I know.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.680]   - Well, everything outside of Austin is the not free part.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.960]   - I do like Austin.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.280]   Austin's a great--
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.280]   - Great music town.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.080]   - Oh man, I'll tell ya.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.040]   - And by the way, if you're in a chili con queso,
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.560]   it's the best place to get it.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.920]   - Really?
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.480]   - I mean, while we're going down rat holes,
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.800]   we might have hoped bringing a little food rat hole once
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.960]   in a while, you know, we haven't had too many food rat holes.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.880]   - So in reference to the--
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.960]   - Put up plenty of them here in Boston,
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.280]   I can give you a list.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.400]   - Should we con quesos or food rat holes?
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.240]   - Yeah.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.080]   - Really, really bad.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.400]   There's some video on YouTube, you can really not check out.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.920]   (laughing)
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.480]   - So I wanna thank Jay Hyrer or something like that
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:34.280]   who had sent us a link to Mac OS X hints
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.200]   in regard to the spinning beach balled land network drives,
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.960]   one of your wines, Merlin Mann, that I echoed.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.360]   - That's right.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.520]   - He says, "Having finally suffered one too many
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.080]   spinning beach balls of death,
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.960]   I have switched to using SFTP to move,
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.920]   rename, or delete files on remote drives."
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.360]   That's the secure FTP.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   - I don't know if that's really gonna fix it,
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.600]   but what I wanna do is, see, I have a network share
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.360]   and I wanna have that drive open all the time,
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.560]   I wanna SFTP over to it.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.440]   But he says if you use a tunnel with SSH,
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.760]   that'll also do it.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.560]   - What if there's anything that you can modify?
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   I mean, there's something that's causing that to poop out.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.240]   I wonder if there's anything that you could modify
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.080]   in the terminal.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.840]   - Just a timeout setting that's too long.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.160]   - Yeah, some kind of a bit you can flip.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.000]   - They're hot.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.960]   - It would tell it to be more gracious
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.960]   about stuff getting disconnected.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.160]   - Who is Antonella Barbra?
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.440]   - She was the American idol Hadi,
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.360]   who has had to herself quite literally exposed
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.040]   all over the internet thanks to some photographs
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.960]   she allowed to have taken.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.200]   - Oh, you mean like Cat Schwartz?
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.040]   He has something like something like that.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.960]   - You remember what Cat did?
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.720]   I felt so bad for her.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:49.480]   She had some nude pictures taken, tasteful nude pictures taken.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.360]   And like so much how her, the headshot looked from it,
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.320]   that she went into Photoshop and just cropped it down
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.080]   to just her head and was using it for headshots
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.760]   until somebody figured out that the thumbnail,
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.960]   she hadn't changed the thumbnail,
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.680]   that the thumbnail contained the entire nude photo.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.520]   - Oh no.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.360]   - Oh, isn't that awful?
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.840]   I felt so bad for it.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.680]   - Wow.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.600]   - Well this young girl did not intend for these photos
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.200]   to be distributed a quote unquote friend helped her with that.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.520]   - Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.760]   - And some of them were actually, if they're her,
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.280]   not all that tasteful.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.120]   But--
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.920]   - Now you may wonder why this is the top story
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.880]   on the Apple iPhone show.com.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880]   - I'm wondering.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.400]   (laughing)
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.160]   - I'll tell you why, because I did a search on Technorati
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.920]   for how many people had blogged about this young woman
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.080]   and it's a lot, but it turns out that people blogging
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.360]   about the iPhone, well the iPhone's more popular
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.880]   so the day when America thinks that a potential cell phone,
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.160]   which is not even a cell phone you can have today,
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.640]   is more important than an incredibly beautiful,
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.680]   young, nearly naked girl that shows you
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.800]   where we're going as a country.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   - That's good news.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.160]   - Like the answer.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.000]   (laughing)
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.840]   - Apple iPhone.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.000]   - I wish that I would not have Googled this girl.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.600]   - Applephone show.com, do not Google and Tinella Barba,
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.960]   whatever you do.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:05.800]   - Whoops.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   - Whoopsie, I didn't.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.320]   - Go back to that iPhone.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.680]   - I didn't, yep.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.000]   If you Google her, you will literally Google her.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.720]   - I just would like to take a moment to admire
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.640]   the way that Scott has been able to defend his searching
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.320]   for naked ladies by making it in the context
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.480]   of the iPhone.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.920]   Well, it's really to be exhaustive in my research.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.080]   I wanted to find out which other naked celebrities
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.720]   the iPhone is also more popular than.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.560]   - Oh dear, oh dear.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.360]   But see, Justine and I have never seen American idols
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.680]   so we don't know what you're talking about.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.840]   - Either of I, well I watched it once.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.440]   I watched it once when that Kelly Clarkson girl was on.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.680]   - Well 27 million people watch it
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.280]   every Tuesday and Wednesday night.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.960]   - Only watch it once in college.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.640]   I just needed the money man.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.280]   I can't even hear him.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.280]   - I didn't inhale either.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.760]   - Is it true more people vote for an American idol
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.720]   than vote in presidential elections?
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:56.560]   - Oh, that's correct.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.600]   - That's depressing if that's true.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.080]   - That is absolutely correct.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.480]   - If you could vote multiple times for presidential election
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.840]   between the Republicans of the Democrats,
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.400]   they'd kick American idols, but.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.280]   - If you want to vote for tennis coos, Cinich.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.480]   - It's like my problem. - Text seven on three, oh four.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.160]   - My problem is that some of these people
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.840]   are feeling so strongly about these contestants
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.680]   they're willing to spend 99 cents 23 times
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.760]   to further their careers.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.680]   - How, how, how.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.600]   - That's problematic.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.760]   - And so they allow you to vote more than once.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.440]   That's not right.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.000]   - You can vote as many times as you like.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.520]   I'm not quite sure what that's all about.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.560]   - Well I'll tell you what it's about.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.920]   99 cents a vote.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.760]   That's what it's about.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.600]   - I was, yeah.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.840]   - Nevermind.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.120]   Actually you only, you only have to pay if you text message
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.280]   your vote, which means that of course, Justine will be poor.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.560]   But those who have been on TV
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.000]   so she can't watch American Idol anyway.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.400]   - How long is those texting?
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.640]   - She's texting blind.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.840]   Those of us who use telephones can call
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:47.960]   an 800 number and call her.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.800]   - That's free.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.480]   They have to do that probably, but I think I bet.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   - To the ancient technologies Justine,
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.600]   us old sage guys will help you with the ancient technology.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.240]   - You know Justine in the early days,
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.240]   phones had dials, you'd turn them and they go.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.480]   (squeaking)
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.040]   - Dios, look at Mr. Franci Pads.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.600]   Mine had a crank.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.160]   You turned it three or four times,
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.160]   you had a nice conversation with the operator.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.160]   - Hello, Sucker.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.960]   - I wish I had had a crank.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.560]   All I had was a single number.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.760]   You could hit that number and if you didn't like
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.440]   the person or the other end, you'd buy a new phone.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.320]   - Oh, and was a teen gang in a string.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.320]   - Now that I recall the crank didn't actually operate the phone,
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.960]   it woke up the parrot inside the box.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.160]   Who had listened to what you said,
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.160]   then fly, fly, fly to the destination.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.160]   - Luxury, we dreamed of having a parrot phone.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.720]   - I'm old enough to remember telephonic changes.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.800]   - We had a telephonic change where I grew up.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.640]   - My grandparents had a party line.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.680]   And up until the 1970s, they had an actual party line.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.600]   - A lot of rural people still do, you can't,
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.120]   because there's not enough lines to it.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.520]   - That rural area of Clearwater, Florida.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.080]   - At Justine's thinking to herself,
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.720]   man, I'm sure glad I called in to be a part of this show.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.560]   - I know.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.160]   - At Justine should be back on definitely when Alex is here
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.880]   because I think you guys share a lot of DNA
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.760]   in terms of your media usage, it sounds like.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.400]   - They don't look like they share a lot of DNA, I gotta tell you.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.080]   - So doesn't he want to get a big projection TV?
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.480]   Isn't that his big plan?
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.640]   He's holding out until he can shoot it on the wall,
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.880]   like really big.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.880]   - There you go.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.520]   - He tells me that he sits in his apartment
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.200]   with his wife on their couch with the 17-inch
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.440]   Mac-B - Pro-balanced on his lap.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.280]   - That's so ridiculous.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.280]   - Watching TV, I'm like.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.720]   - I've done that, it's not fun.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.560]   It's not fun.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.400]   - I do do that.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.240]   - Do you?
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.160]   - Really?
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.480]   - I really, it's how I watch movies.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.880]   - That's how my daughter watches movies too.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.280]   She takes them upstairs and watches them on her iBook.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.520]   - I just don't get it.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.160]   - You also get angry burns on your thighs
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   if it's like a three-hour David Lean movie.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.400]   That's no good.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.040]   - It's true, the more beautiful the movie,
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.720]   the hotter the computer, that's true.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.360]   - That is true.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.980]   - So we'll see Justine, we notice she never wears shorts.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.680]   - I do. - She has not noticed that,
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.800]   but I'm glad you shared that with us, Scott.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.240]   - I live in a good store. - She has to wear long pants
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.880]   because of the burns left on her lap.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.360]   - Now somebody told me. - I know.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.240]   - All right, I'm gonna give you two stories, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.320]   - Of the jury.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.440]   And you tell me which one is true
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.800]   and which one is false.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.720]   Story number one comes from clubmac.ie,
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:15.880]   the Irish clubmac forums, a picture on the forum.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.240]   Search results for Mac Pro.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   Now quad core or eight core processing configure yours today.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.320]   This looks like a picture for the Apple store.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.160]   Pretty clearly.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.920]   - It's you K, it slipped out on the UK site.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.440]   - It looks like it came out on the Irish Ireland site.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.280]   - Yep.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.120]   - That's one, the other story,
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.280]   Apple unveils new product unveiling product.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.800]   At a highly anticipated media event,
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.600]   Tuesday at San Francisco's Moscone Center,
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.440]   Apple incorporated the CEO Steve Jobs,
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.560]   introduced a new Apple product he said would revolutionize
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.400]   the process of unveiling new products throughout the world.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.720]   It's called the iLaunch.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.400]   And it will, it prompted the audience of technology,
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.640]   journalists, developers and self professed Apple fanatics
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.320]   who burst into a five minute standing ovation.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.680]   Get ready for the future of product introduction, says Jobs.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.880]   Looking resplendent in a black,
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   turn on echo faded jeans,
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.920]   the iLaunch will be able to make announcements from this
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.440]   or any other stage making human participation
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.880]   in generating consumer awareness
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.160]   almost entirely unnecessary.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.160]   Switch is true.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:23.240]   I think story number one.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.760]   - Story number one. - Story number one.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.600]   - Oh, iLaunch sounds like a great product though.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.680]   - I think it could be true.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:29.720]   - What about the eight core Mac?
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.560]   You think that's true?
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.880]   You think that's, it doesn't look fake.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.800]   I'm looking at the image right now.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.480]   - Also the timing is spot on.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.280]   - Yeah, I mean, this is exactly the right time
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.680]   for Apple to introduce an eight core.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.160]   - The processor exists until shipped it last month.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.000]   - But here's what everybody's really gonna be saying tomorrow.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.680]   Leo, when is the 16 core coming?
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.160]   (laughing)
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.040]   As I've said before, I've got a four core
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.480]   and I can't use all four.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.520]   I mean, I've never seen it maxed out.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.760]   I'll play World of Warcraft while I'm recording this show.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.600]   I mean, nevermind.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.400]   - Okay, let's move on to another show.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.200]   (laughing)
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.920]   - That's nasty. - You're always gonna
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.760]   have people complaining that, oh my God,
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.320]   I just wasted my money on a computer
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.160]   that only has one quarter the processing power
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.360]   of a Hal 9000.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.200]   (laughing)
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.600]   Boy, did I get a rook or what?
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   - I'm sorry. - I should have waited 18 months.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.960]   - You are screwed, okay.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.640]   - Just remember you always buy your computers
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.760]   about three weeks after Leo.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.920]   - Yeah, that probably would be a good idea.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.920]   (laughing)
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.600]   - Let's see, we have so many good submissions.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.400]   By the way, if you'd like to add a story
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.840]   to our list of stories, frankly, we don't.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.120]   So you should just go to Delicious
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:43.200]   and sign up for free account, d-e-l-dot-i-c-i-o-dot-us.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.760]   And if you use the tag m-b-w-i-d-i-d-is,
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.360]   all one word on any story when you bookmark it,
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   we will see it and probably in our desperation will read.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.680]   - Steal it. - Yeah.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.320]   (laughing)
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.600]   - Basically, that's it.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.920]   (laughing)
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.280]   - I was doing the research on the web today.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.880]   - Oh, I've done it.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.320]   - Here's an article from Wired News.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.480]   Somebody said, "I think probably aiming this in Merlin.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.200]   "Downloading is a Pacrat's dream.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.440]   "The technical name is Syllagomania."
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.960]   - Ah! (laughing)
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.320]   - Compulsive hoarding.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.160]   - Compulsive.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.480]   - Today on Nerd Oprah.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.320]   (laughing)
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.400]   - Syllagomania.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.000]   - The latest fake reason for you to worry about your life.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.240]   (laughing)
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.160]   - Merlin, not his real name,
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.240]   is an info hoarder like few others.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.160]   In the last four years, this 40-year-old San Francisco native
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.520]   has downloaded and burned every piece of broadcast
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.880]   and print media that's been digitized.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:39.720]   - What are you reading?
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   - Learn your videos.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.560]   (laughing)
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.360]   - How do they know?
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.640]   - His apartment is filled with DVDs and CDs
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.960]   packed with bootleg anime, comic books, books,
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.880]   e-books, television programs, movies, and of course music.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.200]   - Girl, at last my anime habits been exposed.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.360]   (laughing)
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.200]   - Not an on-a-note fan.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.440]   - Yeah, I have to admit that my own data hoarding habit
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.680]   has gone out of control.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.160]   My office is taken up with almost two whole shoe boxes
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.720]   sized worth of data drives and CDs now.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.760]   But they terabyte some information.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.120]   - I did know somebody, but this was in the early days
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.560]   of the Mac, who made it a point of owning every piece
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.200]   of Mac software and he had a closet that was filled
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.680]   with floppy diskettes.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.800]   There were thousands of them.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.600]   - I used to have that with the zip drives.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.680]   I used to have shoe boxes full of zip-tons.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.880]   - See, we know this.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.440]   - I do have a couple of,
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.800]   actually probably 900 to 1,000 3 1/2 inch floppies
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:36.800]   with the status of my Macintosh world as of 1989.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.200]   I save them only because I don't clean up my office
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.760]   more than once or twice a year,
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.920]   but now I hold on to them because when else am I gonna
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.200]   find a copy of Mac Draw 1.0?
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.120]   When am I gonna get a copy of Mac Draw 1.0?
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.600]   - Does Mac Draw 1.0 run on system seven?
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.320]   - Let alone OS 10.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.400]   - Actually, I gotta, I can go find out.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.360]   I can get an answer for that Leo.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.600]   - You have a system seven machine?
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.000]   - I have reference hardware for,
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.840]   'cause I have data disks that go all the way back.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:09.360]   I do keep a Macintosh LC loaded with system 602.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.200]   - You're coming to us?
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.560]   - I do have a power PC 602.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.320]   - Is it running right now?
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.440]   - It's not running right now.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.160]   It is actually on the top tippy top shelf of my data stack.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.680]   If I, well, what's--
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.000]   - This man has Selogemanian big time.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.200]   - That's impressive.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.000]   - You are, you are, you are, you know what?
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.960]   Everyone I've ever met is a pretend nerd compared to you,
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.040]   and you're a real nerd.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:30.880]   - I haven't had--
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.720]   - No, but he's a journalist and--
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.960]   - Have to say something about my K-Pro.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.360]   I've got a K-Pro that's working.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.200]   It's over there.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   I've got my naval intelligence.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.760]   - And ask me about my T-shirt that says,
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.240]   ask me about my K-Pro.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.920]   - Okay, exactly.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.480]   But do you have an Osborne Andy?
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.440]   That's what I wanna know.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.280]   - K-Pro is better than an Osborne.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.480]   - I don't have an Osborne 1.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.760]   I do have an Osborne 2.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.320]   - With the green or amber screen?
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:52.160]   - Green screen.
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.880]   - You know, I thought John Foster was a geek, but clearly.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.680]   You have completely outclassed us all.
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.680]   - I see real, real.
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.880]   - I live in Boston, which is the home to the MIT flea market.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.000]   Every single month from every top.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.640]   And it's like, you know, gee, I got $7 in my pocket.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:11.880]   Maybe I should have a cosmic VIP manifest to the 1977.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.720]   - No, I would.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.120]   - Wow, I'm impressed.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.560]   I'm very impressed.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.720]   - Do you have an SE30?
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.040]   - I believe me, every single Macintosh that's been manufactured,
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.000]   I probably have at least one of,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.560]   probably 'cause there was a time,
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:29.240]   well, see, there was a time when I was manufacturing
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.760]   like two or three macarons, like a month,
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.120]   chief had to give away for charity stuff.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.080]   And so I had to have like 40 or 50 of them ready to go
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.280]   at any given time.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.600]   I still have probably a dozen left, but I mean,
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:44.120]   there was like a game of musical chairs that happened
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.560]   when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.480]   suddenly decided that in two months time, CRT is gonna be
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.360]   considered hazardous waste and they're gonna charge you
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.800]   five bucks, you should get rid of them.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.200]   And so I had that amount of time to go through the 40 Macs
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.600]   I had left and decide which six or seven were worth keeping.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:01.480]   So I took out the, I had had PowerStrip right there
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.600]   in my storage locker saying, okay, here's an SE30,
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.480]   that's clean and it works cool, I'll keep that one.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.120]   Here's the black Mac TV that actually powers up and work,
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.520]   I'll keep this one.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.080]   - It's like Sophie's Choice with Motorola processors.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.440]   (laughing)
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.640]   - Z-Truth, Z-Truth, I do not know about the TZ-Truth.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.040]   - Wow, I'm impressed.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.000]   - But on a more serious note, I only keep like,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.760]   I keep a system six machine standing by,
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:30.360]   I keep a system nine machine standing by chiefly so that,
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.400]   again, I've got data that goes back,
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.440]   I've been filling up discs with like personal writings
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.200]   and personal research and personal codes since 1984.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.720]   And believe me, it's gonna be so much more difficult
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.840]   to find a bootable machine or a machine that can read
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:46.200]   Microsoft Word 1.0 file off of a 400K, MFS disk.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.080]   You know, that's something I can do like on an hour's notice
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.520]   here, otherwise it's gonna delay and see on ordering
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.720]   some of that stuff off of eBay, then trust me,
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.080]   it's gonna work, it's pretty, pretty horrible.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.520]   It's worse than a regular run.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.880]   - You can answer a question for me though,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.400]   'cause I've had this, this is one of those,
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.360]   if you sit around with other geeks and drink beer,
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.920]   you eventually have this conversation.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.560]   I gotta say that in terms of perceived speed for me,
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.600]   I think the SE30, like still in my memory,
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.040]   felt like the fastest computer I ever used.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.680]   And really any kind of a fairly modern,
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.320]   for the time, Mac running system six, felt so snappy.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.480]   And I'm just curious, in using these different systems
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.200]   on these different boxes, does it feel snappier to you
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.080]   than OS X?
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.320]   - It depends on the setup.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.440]   As I speak to you right now, I've got an Intel Mac book
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.520]   that's running Skype off to my right.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.200]   On front of me, I've got my PowerPC, PowerBook,
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.800]   which Lilith, which is my usual writing and researching one.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.640]   - Lilith.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.480]   - Right now, Lilith before.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.320]   - Is it gay?
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:47.440]   - I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.520]   - That was really uncalled for.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.040]   See, not only was it mean Leo, it was fast and mean,
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.960]   and that's what you were probably talking about.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.360]   (laughing)
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.840]   - You name your, okay, nevermind, I'm not gonna go to it.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.200]   - Lilith!
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.920]   - Why did you name it Lilith?
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.640]   - Well, because much like the mythological Lilith,
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.480]   it goes out into the world and the response
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.320]   new demons with which to torment humanity.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.160]   - That's true.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.000]   - Lilith, like the first woman in--
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.800]   - Female Mesopotamian Night Demon, actually.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.800]   - Yes, cast out of the Garden of Eden for either,
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:16.880]   depending on whose story you believe,
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.520]   cast out of the Garden of Eden because
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.880]   either she was too smart and refused to bow down before Adam
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.800]   or because she was just mean to people.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.120]   - But she's also--
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.200]   (laughing)
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.040]   - She's also--
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.200]   - I heard us 'cause she refused to recycle.
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.640]   (laughing)
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.280]   - She's also apple quartz going the green bin, Lilith.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:35.400]   - Excuse me, Lilith.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.720]   - Oh.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:39.040]   - She's really need to talk to you about a couple things.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:39.880]   - Oh.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.200]   - Can I just point out--
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.000]   - We need to rename the show.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.600]   - What's the new name?
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.440]   - The name is--
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.720]   - Rattle Break.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.560]   - It really shows.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.080]   - So what feels fastest now?
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:49.920]   That's a simple question.
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:52.800]   The ones you've got, you're set up, what feels snappy?
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:56.160]   - Right after startup Intel Mac blows everything else away.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.120]   Or actually, if that's what blows everything else away.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.440]   I'm saying that there's a plateau,
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.920]   meaning you make a decision,
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.600]   the computer fulfills that wish immediately.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.520]   Whereas a Mac SE 30 will almost always have
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.560]   that layer of ability, as will an Apple II,
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:13.000]   as will my MS DOS 3.0 machine,
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.040]   rather 2.11 machine.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.680]   There's so much more ever had going on
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:20.400]   with a Mac OS 10 device that the longer you keep it up,
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.840]   the longer you're gonna find yourself saying,
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.240]   yes, this is why I spent $2,000 at the Apple Store,
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.840]   so I could watch a spinning beach ball.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.520]   I love that spinning beach ball.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.120]   I wanna spread a check for $800 more to Apple.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.440]   This is how much fun I'm having,
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.360]   watching this thing do nothing while I wait.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.040]   - Well, now that brings us to the portion of the show
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.840]   where we bring up our Mac wines.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.720]   That will be followed by our Mac picks.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.200]   And we're gonna let Justine off the hook,
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.400]   unless, 'cause we didn't warn her ahead of time
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.240]   that we were gonna do that.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:46.360]   - I do have a Mac pick though.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.400]   - Okay, and if you come up with a wine,
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.400]   I'll leave you for last.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.240]   - Okay.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.080]   - If you come up, I never,
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:51.920]   and I just wanna tell you,
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.280]   I can never come up with a wine.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.480]   I always afterwards say, oh yeah, you're right.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.320]   That bugs me too, but I can never think of a wine.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.000]   Let's start with Andy and Naco.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.360]   Is there something bugging you lately about your Mac?
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.240]   - The fact that my DVD burner doesn't work on my powerbook,
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.400]   which is, I'm kinda hard on my machines.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.200]   I really do beat the, I carry 'em everywhere.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.120]   I don't really care,
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.360]   I don't take really great care of 'em
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.320]   'cause they tend to be pretty good.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.320]   But the DVD burner on my powerbook here broke back in February.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.640]   And now, I don't wanna make you think
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.480]   that I don't have a hundred bucks to spend
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.640]   on a replacement mechanism.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.200]   Not only do I have a hundred bucks,
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.120]   I'm gonna make another hundred dollars in the future.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.520]   So that's, the money's not an issue.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.360]   - You got two of your bucks.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.920]   - You know, I didn't wanna come out and say that,
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.640]   but God bless you for making me look like a big fan
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.480]   for everybody.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.000]   But this is the aluminum powerbook 15 inch.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.120]   And my God, it was not worth it.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.160]   - Well, no, it's worth, 'cause you can buy
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.880]   a replacement mechanism for like 70 bucks.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.520]   It's not, there are two reasons why I'm not
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.840]   re-fixing it 'cause once again,
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.840]   I've got Lilith number eight standing by.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.800]   And soon as Lilith number seven here decides
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.000]   to give up the go-to-sides if we could retire.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.680]   But the thing is, it's Indiana Jones had an easier time
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.720]   getting that gold idol out of the temple
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.240]   at the start of Raise the Lost Ark
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.640]   than it is to take a DVD drive or hard drive
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.480]   out of this model.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.600]   - If you throw me the head, I will throw you the whip.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.200]   - I'd rather get the whip than spend an hour
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200]   digging through the innards of this,
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.040]   trying to get it to release the DVD drive.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:17.880]   - I know, just me about that.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.720]   - Again, it's like a $70 part.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.840]   I'd much rather, believe it or not,
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.840]   every time I have to install something off of the CD
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.280]   on Lilith here, what I'm doing is I'm just
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.080]   popping the disc into one of my other Macintosh
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.440]   is building a disc image, putting it onto a key drive,
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.760]   and then installing it from the key drive.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.600]   - Wow.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.200]   - That's just so much more palatable to me
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.040]   than again, getting out all my tools,
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.040]   getting out all the muffin tins to sort all the screws
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.720]   'cause they're four different kinds of screws.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.160]   And then there's the point which there are four hidden latches.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.080]   - Well, and you'll never get it back to Ganderow.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:45.920]   - And you'll never get it back to Ganderow.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.200]   - Again, in a way that it fits nicely.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.600]   It's always just a little whopper jot after that.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.840]   - You've got to do it very, very carefully
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.400]   and very slowly and very methodically
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.800]   and they're a really nice online guide that help you out.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.480]   But there's a point in which you're just saying
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.520]   this can't be right, I must be feeling,
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.520]   following the instructions wrong,
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.400]   but you are following them correctly.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.200]   - I took the iBook part once and I never got it back together again.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.840]   - Scott Bourne, wine away.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.280]   - Okay, well, it's, I'm sort of with you Leo.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.280]   I really don't have very many Mac wines to call.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.280]   - Stand over here in the corner where we're at the happy.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.280]   - I have to work on this section of the show
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.720]   because everything works so well.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.840]   But I will kind of have like a mini wine
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.080]   and that is it's the same wine from last week.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.240]   (laughs)
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.120]   I still can't get this thing fixed.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.360]   We're always files download to the little corner
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.360]   of my desktop on top of my trash can
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.880]   and stack up on top of each other.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.200]   I don't understand why that is.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.800]   - Is your computer is on right now
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.400]   because you're speaking, right, Scott?
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.480]   - That is correct.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.520]   - Okay, if you click on the desktop, why don't you hit Apple J?
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.840]   - That will open the Finder preferences.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.480]   - Yes. - Actually, the Finder view preferences.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.360]   - I believe that's what you should see something like that.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.800]   Do you get something like that?
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.840]   - I have system preferences up.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.680]   - Yeah.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.240]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.360]   - It's under the view menu, view options.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.160]   You want to open under the Finder view menu.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.000]   You want to open for the menus?
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:14.840]   - Okay, yeah.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.680]   I got it.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.440]   - And then I'm trying to remember where this exact--
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.120]   - Snap to grid or--
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.000]   - Yeah, what I, I'm trying to think about,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.400]   I was using Pathfinder, so I'm kind of, yeah, exactly.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.960]   I'm trying to manipulate a range by name usually.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.240]   - Keep a range by and yeah.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.480]   - Kind. - And then you, and then you,
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.280]   yeah, and what I do is, here's what I do.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.440]   My trick is, if there's stuff that always lives
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.800]   on the desktop, always, always, always,
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.040]   I make them a different color,
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.600]   and then I say to sort by color.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.800]   And so, what is funny?
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.640]   What is funny?
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.360]   (laughing)
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.600]   - Ooh, through that paper.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   - You do. - I will stop this,
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.840]   I will stop this podcast and turn it around right now.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.680]   - Tell me the truth.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.080]   You don't use the Finder label colors, do you?
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.240]   - I do. - You do?
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.560]   - Dead to me right now.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.960]   You're so dead to me.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.440]   - Yes, then you sort by color,
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.280]   and I'll tell you why. - 'Cause that was gonna
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.800]   be my color. - 'Cause that is the most
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.320]   broken feature in the world.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.160]   Okay, go ahead.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.120]   - I use label colors myself.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.840]   - If you use label colors, yeah.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.720]   And you sort by, you're an old man, is what you are.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.880]   This will sort the color, the color is just--
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.200]   - You don't understand label colors,
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.800]   'cause you weren't meant to understand it, old man.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.760]   You wrecked the planet, but we're gonna save it
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.200]   with our Finder colors.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.920]   - Do you make your folder?
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.360]   - Give me your head with the hair.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:25.000]   - Okay, Laura and I have a problem with that strategy.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:25.840]   - What's that?
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.080]   - My problem is I'm color blind.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.600]   - Oh. (laughs)
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.080]   - So now what, genius?
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.240]   - Well, you used to do it by kind then,
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.680]   so but I actually really wanna know what you do, Merlin.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.640]   So you color, like give me an example of what colors
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.960]   and how you colorize these things.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.600]   - Hey, that works, Merlin. - Not talking now.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.200]   He's not gonna talk to me.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.120]   - Merlin, it worked.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.920]   He fixed my wine. - He's not.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.360]   - Merlin, I'll buy you a hot dog.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.520]   - You fixed my wine, Bubba.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.600]   Thank you.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.920]   - I just downloaded a picture of Antonella Barbara
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.360]   and she didn't go down into the trash like she usually does.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.160]   - That's not what I see on gawk or--
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.240]   - Oh, wait a minute, now he hung up.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.040]   I think I'm hoping this is a technical issue
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.120]   because I don't think we were that hard.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.560]   I was that hard on him, wasn't it?
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.480]   - You're gonna have to send him a box of fruit or something.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.760]   - I've done that before.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.320]   I wouldn't be the first person I sent a box of fruit to.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.880]   He's not answering.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.360]   Oh my God, he's pissed off.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.200]   That can't be-- - No, Skype, that's,
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.800]   no, here, you're gonna edit this out, right?
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.320]   - Yeah.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.160]   - That's like the fifth time that this happened
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.840]   during this call where suddenly everything goes
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.040]   into this like crazy tunnel vision mode
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.400]   and everything gets really, really slow and robot voiced
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.520]   and then drops.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.280]   That's why I keep disappearing.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.480]   Just so you know, I'm not-- - So you're not mad at us?
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.320]   - Oh, I'm mad.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.400]   You wanna come back on?
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.400]   (laughing)
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.560]   When I get back on, buddy, oh, you're gonna feel--
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.720]   - Or let me press the record button.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.760]   - Chunk, go ahead.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.440]   So I says to him, I says--
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.240]   - Don't know, I'm curious 'cause I wanna know,
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.960]   okay, so how do you use colors to categorize?
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.760]   Is it by urgency?
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.760]   What are you, what are you categorizing?
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.320]   - It doesn't matter, it just use any color.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.440]   So in my case, I have a downloads folder
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.200]   that is, an alias of a downloads folder
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.520]   that I keep on the desktop.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.160]   And I'm, what do I have, a couple other things?
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.560]   But yeah, we'll send my GTD, my KGTD document.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.080]   - So you just give it a random color
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.560]   just to keep it organized. - Any color.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.200]   - Yeah, any color and then sort by color
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.800]   and then here's why that's good
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.520]   because then you can just grab everything
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.320]   that's not that color and drop it into you
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.760]   and I have a junk folder that I drop in.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.320]   - Exactly, I use it as a tagging system
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.840]   where if I'm spending a day just basically
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   sorting through a big folder,
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.400]   I know there's some that wanna copy over here,
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.320]   some I wanna delete, some I wanna back up.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.200]   I'll use one different tag for each different thing.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.360]   Then at the end of the day, I'll just do a spotlight search,
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.160]   take everything that's red, burn onto a CD,
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.360]   take everything that's blue, copy it off to another drive.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.040]   - Wow, how do you use it, Justine?
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.280]   - Wow, that's a lot more intense than I use it
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.680]   just because it makes my folders a little bit prettier.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.280]   - No, use it for just decorating.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.760]   - Well, not, well, sometimes, but I tag a lot of the stuff
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.640]   that's mine personally pink or then other projects
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.480]   they all have a different color.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.120]   So if there's a random file somewhere else and it's green,
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.720]   I'll know that it goes with some certain CD artwork
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.560]   that I'm working on that's tagged green.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.920]   - Oh, that makes sense, so it's project colors.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.600]   - Yeah, you're right Leo, it would be cool
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.680]   if it was more semantic.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.000]   I mean, you can use them semantically, for example,
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.120]   I think there's a bunch of different backup apps
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.040]   that will honor what you've labeled something.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:25.040]   So for example, my red is the label for my red label is delete.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.200]   So I can do it, you know what I mean?
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.400]   So I can say like, oh, you know,
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.320]   when you do this backup, skip anything that's red,
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.160]   something like that.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.680]   - So if you open the Finder preferences,
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.400]   you can't go in and name these, you don't get many,
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.760]   you only get what, seven of them,
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.320]   but you can name them instead of red, orange, yellow, green,
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.320]   you could say delete.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.560]   All right, well, what do you mean,
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.760]   I'd like to try this.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.560]   So what would you recommend as names?
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.040]   Delete file.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.720]   - Well, it depends, just for the desktop,
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.320]   you might want to go-- - My exaction.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.360]   - You might have one that's green and call it evergreen.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.560]   And that way you'll remember that those are things
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.400]   that-- - Yeah.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.960]   - Well, soft is an easy chair.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.800]   - Okay.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.560]   (laughing)
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.120]   - It's a little Barbara Streisand joke.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:08.280]   - Yeah, like that Barbara's right saying?
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.000]   - Trust for the few bars of that.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   ♪ Love soft is an easy chair ♪
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.960]   - Okay. ♪ Love soft is a more ♪
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.800]   - I have a new Mac wine.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.640]   - Love.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.400]   - Your attempts to sing are killing me.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.040]   - I'm not sure about that.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.160]   - So, okay, evergreen would be good blue,
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.120]   you would make down the pooper shoot.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:30.960]   - Okay.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.800]   - This is one of those things though.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.840]   If you're an old school Mac nerd,
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.000]   I mean, this is a very old school Mac,
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:36.840]   what was that, Andy?
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.360]   Probably six or seven, this came out,
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.760]   I'm gonna get seven.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.600]   - Seven, I think.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.280]   - And yeah. - I tried every time
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.400]   to use these and I can never really come up
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.240]   with a good way.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.480]   - Well, you know what would be really sexy also,
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.640]   would be to have someone to tie it in a spotlight
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.480]   tagging data.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.600]   That would be the other thing, it's very cool.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.680]   So, it could also, so it would be really great
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.560]   if you could have it so that using like a folder action,
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.000]   it would change colors based on things like aging.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.200]   - I just look at the name of the file and I go,
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.400]   oh yeah, I don't want that anymore to delete.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.480]   Oh yeah, that goes in a folder to move.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.120]   - I'm kinda surprised, Leo, 'cause I mean,
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.120]   I think with Windows people, even more than Mac people,
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.520]   people, some people can be really anal
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.960]   about the way they set up their desktop
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.880]   and this is one way, it happens, I'm not.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.240]   But some people are really particular
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.640]   about how everything's laid on, they're desktop.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.680]   If you move anything, they get really freaked out.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.440]   And labels are one way to help control that
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.200]   in a way that's kind of semantic.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.640]   - My desktop is a disaster.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.600]   - Is it, do you have a lot of icons in your desktop?
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.920]   - There's everything, and then I have this little
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.520]   desktop folder that I throw everything into.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.400]   (laughing)
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.880]   - So that's a disaster.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.440]   - Yeah, it's so bad.
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.040]   - I was just about to say, I have,
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.440]   for the purposes chiefly of giving presentations
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.560]   when people actually have to see how I live on my computer,
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.480]   I have a folder entitled, "My Desktop is Always
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.480]   This Tidy," and I actually have an automated action
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.720]   that runs every Thursday morning.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.680]   It simply says, "Take everything on the desktop,
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.920]   "that is not this folder, create a new folder
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.440]   "with a date, copy it into this folder
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.360]   "and hide it inside the desktop folder."
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.800]   - I feel like such a punter compared to you guys.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.640]   I mean, you're so--
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.160]   - Well Leo, you know, this is a good time
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.720]   to mention something that we talked about on Macbreak
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.320]   a few months ago, which is Hazel.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.960]   Have any of you guys used Hazel before?
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.280]   - No, I haven't.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.040]   - Hazel's in preference pane and you pointed
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.320]   at any folder, could be your downloads folder,
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.360]   could be your desktop folder, and it does stuff
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.840]   based on rules that you set.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.760]   So you can say, for example, move all my MP3s
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.040]   into this MP3 folder or do this thing
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.520]   after this amount of time and so forth.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.880]   And if you're somebody who likes to have that
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.320]   Andy-like stuff but isn't an Apple script person,
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   Hazel's pretty cool.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.720]   - This is as opposed to Sister Hazel,
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.640]   which is the Rock and Roll band.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.400]   - Yeah, I don't think they're supported on OS X.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.240]   - Okay, sure.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.400]   That's a classic app.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.040]   - Classic Rock app.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.760]   ♪ Soft as an easy chair ♪
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.920]   - So Hazel is free, yes.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.240]   - Oh, the Hazel--
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.160]   - Oh, you pay a little money.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.680]   It's noodlesoft.com.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:56.440]   - As a matter of fact, Hazel 2.0 alpha
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.600]   is now running for testing as of last week.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.800]   - Oh, you know about Hazel too, huh?
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.600]   - No, I don't because the Automator action
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.360]   was just so easy to put together.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.480]   But now I'm gonna try that.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.160]   - You kind of like what your Automator action does actually.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.240]   - Yes, only you didn't have to do it yourself.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.480]   We just had to download something.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.000]   I know I'm an idiot, I do things myself.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:14.840]   - I think it's cool to write it.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.800]   - It's partners like me who built this country.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.880]   - That's right.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.040]   - We diverted the rivers, we cleared the forest,
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.200]   we made the land terrible.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.960]   - So you like the arable land, you did not see it.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.400]   - I do, I'm an arable fan.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.880]   So Hazel works on those labels,
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.560]   so you could use labels as a way to activate Hazel.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.400]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.080]   - That's neat, I'll have to try it.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.600]   It's funny 'cause I do remember that now
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.200]   in Macbreak, we had just...
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.320]   I believe it's, let's see Andy, you wind,
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.080]   and let's see who else wind.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.240]   Merlin, you haven't wind you.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.120]   - I have a really dumb, super short one.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:52.520]   And I've mentioned this before, but this is,
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.720]   talk about an old man wind.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.480]   I really hate that it's so hard and costly
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.400]   to fix computers. (laughs)
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.280]   I hate the fact that Madeline's totally awesome,
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.440]   12 Madeline is my wife, her 12 inch power book.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.680]   Like apparently almost every 12 inch power book
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.200]   in America, the latch broke.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.040]   - Yep.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.840]   - And reports are, the reports are
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.120]   that if I wanna do anything about that,
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.320]   it's gonna be six bills.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.840]   - Whoa.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.080]   - Have you got an estimate on that?
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.000]   - I just live with a broken latch.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.640]   - I googled around on this, I have not gone to a genius yet
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.520]   because most of my genius things end up with me
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.280]   acting like a curly from the three stooges.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.120]   And...
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.560]   (laughs)
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.560]   - You know, not many people know that the latch
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.640]   is actually made from the finger bone of St. Augustine.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.760]   That's why it's a pricey item.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.480]   You pay extra for saintly quality.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.720]   - It told me they could give me something
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.320]   from St. Paul's Casket that would be just a little bit more.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.160]   But I...
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.600]   - Hey, if you want the def to remain deaf,
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.000]   go ahead, use an aftermarket item.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.080]   But you know, you're gonna want...
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:50.920]   (laughs)
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.720]   If you find yourself erupting in boils,
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:55.400]   you're gonna want that St. Augustine finger bone.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.720]   - But let me just say,
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.840]   you don't care about your family,
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.560]   buy the Paul's coffin, I don't care.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.720]   (laughs)
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.880]   But that guy's crazy that the whole,
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.280]   apparently from what I can Google around,
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.760]   and I have not gone in and gone to the genius,
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.120]   'cause like I say, it makes me crazy.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.960]   But everything that I've read
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.880]   in the two or three stories I found was like,
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.720]   it's like $600 no matter what.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.960]   If you want to fix this case.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.120]   And that makes me a little crazy.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.480]   - They probably replaced the whole case.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.920]   - 'Cause you know, the 12 inch Mac is so awesome.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.600]   The 12 inch PowerBook is so exciting.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.120]   - I'm sad that they discontinued that, frankly.
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.280]   - I am so sad that they discontinued that.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.840]   And right now, we've talked about this before.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.240]   There, I mean, they're still getting
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.360]   a thousand bucks on the market for those.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.680]   So anyway, that's,
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.360]   and I guess this line extends a little bit because,
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.600]   you know, it just seems like it's awfully costly
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.920]   to try and do anything with your Mac.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.720]   And I guess you just gotta go buy a new one,
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.320]   but I can't go buy a 12 inch, so, you know, anyway,
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.160]   that's my thing.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.040]   - You know, my wife also, like Madeline,
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.920]   my wife uses a 12 inch for her email,
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.720]   and I have a 15 inch that's not used,
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.480]   and I keep saying, well, let me move you to the 15
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.760]   and she doesn't want to, she likes it.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.840]   - Well, she might not touch it.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.240]   Well, you understand, she graduated from my old 17 inch,
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.240]   which has been always 45 pounds.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.200]   So this poor, swelt woman was carrying
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.680]   around this 17 inch PowerBook,
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.880]   which is like pizza tray.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.720]   - That's silly.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.560]   - Yeah.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.040]   - So now she's on the 12 inch, she's never looked back.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:07.880]   No, she's finally there.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.120]   She puts it in the, in the in case
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.320]   and just walks around with it.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.200]   Makes me nuts to think that she's got this thing
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.280]   that's not sleeping correctly, you know, but.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.960]   - My mom made a little purse for it,
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:20.280]   12 inch purse that's felted and has grass growing on it.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.480]   It's quite attractive, but.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.160]   - Wow, that's intense.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.000]   - It will only fit the-
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.160]   - Your mother's adorable.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.240]   - Yeah, she is, really, and she's got four foot eight
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.280]   and she makes little, the other thing,
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.720]   she's big into felting, you know,
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.040]   which is I guess some textile technique
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.520]   where you take a yarn and,
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.520]   and then you, I don't know what you trod on it with.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.360]   - Yeah.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.400]   - And with the beryllium and then it turns into felt.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.320]   And she makes little felted people as well.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.520]   - That is adorable.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.520]   - Yeah, they're really cute.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.520]   (laughing)
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.360]   - She, you know, it would-
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.280]   - She'd never, you should never sell them on eBay
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.640]   or make a real store.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.880]   - Well, I keep thinking we could do a store,
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.040]   but the problem is how much could you sell them for?
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.720]   It takes her like a day to make each one.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.280]   So you couldn't sell it for enough.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.120]   It's just, you know.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.200]   So anyway, that's that story.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.680]   - Maybe your mom and Aunt Fay and,
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.480]   and Andy, don't you have an aunt that you're talking about?
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.920]   - I have my aunt Estelle, yes.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.560]   - Wish her all you got out.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.400]   - Yeah.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.640]   - We gotta have them do a high tech start up for old folks.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.320]   - I think they should do a podcast.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.120]   - I bet they keep on topic better than us.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.920]   - They know they can't talk it.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.760]   - Let's see.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.320]   - They all get together and complain about how awful we are
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.160]   to them.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.000]   - I'm gonna pass on-
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.080]   - My grandma, she,
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.640]   my grandma does listen to Mac Break
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.520]   and she listens to all my podcasts.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.760]   She's on Twitter.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.000]   She is intense.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.560]   - Wow, I wanna add her is my Twitter friend.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.760]   What's, do you wanna,
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.000]   maybe we shouldn't say what her Twitter.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.080]   - Yeah, we almost.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.240]   - After what's not doing here.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.080]   - Let's tell me what her Twitter is,
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:40.920]   'cause I'd like to add her.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.360]   I'd like to see what grandma's up to.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.200]   Is she the one that she's making you lunch?
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.920]   - She just checks up on me.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.760]   - No.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.600]   - That's your mom.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.440]   - My mom makes me lunch.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.280]   - Okay.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.120]   (laughing)
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.640]   Grandma makes me lunch.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.120]   - I don't even live at home.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:52.960]   - I don't have a wine.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:53.800]   I'm gonna pass on the wine.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.440]   Do you have a wine or should,
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.760]   Justine or should we?
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.080]   - Well, this is really random and photo booth has started.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.120]   - Nothing else that we've done is random.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:02.960]   (laughing)
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.240]   - Justine, Justine, try and keep it on topic.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.920]   - Okay, I'm really, I'm really sorry.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.360]   I know I've been getting off topic here,
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:11.000]   but photo booth has been starting up
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.400]   anytime I restart my Mac for the past month or so.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.000]   And it's not in, like there's no startup things,
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.200]   and the startup items,
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.600]   I've been trying to search for a script or something.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.840]   And a reason why, like I don't know why.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.640]   - You know what you might go to
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.720]   the Macintosh Image Capture program,
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.480]   'cause that's the program
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.640]   that tells the Mac what to do when it sees things.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.400]   And I'm thinking it sees, you've got it set in Image Capture
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.560]   that when it sees your camera,
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.040]   it automatically launches photo booth.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.360]   And since your camera's built in.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.840]   - It's gonna be.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:47.400]   - That it might be, so go to the Image Capture preferences.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.800]   And then it says when a camera is connected
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.840]   or you might just look at that.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.800]   That's my thought off the top of my head.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.800]   Image Capture is.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800]   - That's what it is.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.640]   - Yeah.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.240]   - It's always very uncomfortable in a meeting.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.720]   I restart my computer and then there's these like crazy
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.560]   painters.
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:06.160]   - Yeah, I'm like, okay, let's put this one.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.280]   - Now do you use photo booth and you and Desiree
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.640]   take pictures and stuff like that?
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.720]   - We do, we do, just like ridiculous ones.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.200]   - My kids do that.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.880]   - You're still a kid at heart.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.720]   - I am.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.120]   - My kids totally love photo booths.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.680]   It's the greatest application.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.840]   - It's hilarious.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.920]   - I wonder how many Macs have been sold with photo booth,
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.880]   'cause my sister wanted to buy one for her family.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.640]   And I'm trying to tell her all these wonderful features
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.240]   about how Automator works,
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.320]   how easy it is to print things.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.920]   - How easy it is to print things out.
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.240]   - Oh no, just things are like really, really high tech
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.040]   and she's like, wow, what happens when I take,
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.920]   wow, I can make my picture off goofy.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.040]   Here's $2,000, give me that one.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.440]   - It's really true.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.240]   - I'm sure that's the number one app
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:46.240]   in terms of selling Macs anyway, absolutely.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.840]   All right, let's get to our,
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.280]   so photo booth always launches,
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.320]   that's Justine's wine.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.200]   Now it's time for our picks.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.600]   And I'll start off the top because I give Justine
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.640]   a little bit more time to think,
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.920]   'cause again, we haven't.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.760]   We haven't really prepared him for this.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.840]   But I wanna give a little plug to a guy named Daniel Jalkut,
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.720]   or Jalkut, I'm not sure how you say his name.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.400]   He's red sweater software, red-swetter.com.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.280]   He's been around for a while.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.760]   He actually and I correspond a little bit
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.800]   over some Apple scripts that I wrote,
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.880]   but he recently acquired MarsEdit.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:20.680]   Now MarsEdit was Ranchero Software's blogging software.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.360]   And when Ranchero was acquired
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.640]   and moved over to the big company,
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.800]   I think that the-- - Newsgater.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.880]   - Newsgater, I think they kinda lost interest.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.640]   It may be a little bit in MarsEdit.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.480]   But to their credit, they found Daniel
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.080]   and they got him to take it over.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.240]   And I have very high hopes,
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.880]   'cause I think MarsEdit is a really great blogging tool.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.880]   Do you use MarsEdit, Merlin, or anything like that?
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.720]   - I have used it.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.600]   It's very simple and easy to use.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.760]   And if you're a sort of person,
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.920]   it doesn't like typing in forms on a webpage.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.440]   It's really that way. - It's a great way to blog.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.080]   And it does tie in to Francis Textmate, or BBEdit.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.120]   You can edit it with an external editor.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.080]   It has a lot of nice features on it.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.520]   And I like Daniel a lot.
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.480]   He's a great guy.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.680]   I think it's in very good hands.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.160]   So I'm very hopeful that we'll see
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.160]   some interesting developments with MarsEdit.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.320]   And one way to support it would be
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.880]   to download it now from red-swatter.com.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880]   It's free for 30 days.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.360]   You could try it if you're a blogger.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.960]   You might wanna give it a shot.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.200]   And if you like it, it's 25 bucks.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.560]   And I think it'd really be great
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560]   to keep it going.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:22.000]   Derek's story is a big fan of it, I know.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.280]   - I think he also makes, doesn't he also make FlexTime?
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.480]   - Yep. - Yeah.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:28.240]   FlexTime's a totally sweet timer, too.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.560]   - Now, you know, I have FlexTime,
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.760]   and I'm trying to think of what to do with it.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.680]   (clears throat)
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.600]   - Well, I use it for what, ha ha,
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.720]   on 43 folders we call the procrastination dash.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.400]   It's a way of saying, I'm gonna work for a few minutes
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.240]   and then I'm gonna do something else
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.960]   for a few minutes and then iterate.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.280]   - Excellent. - And it's a really nice
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.120]   little timer app.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.920]   - Yeah, I actually, he sent me a code for it
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.440]   and I haven't installed, so I'll find some ways to use it.
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.920]   Yeah, if you need a timer, FlexTime is amazing.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.760]   And it flex time.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.640]   And he says, 'cause I had written,
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.680]   the reason we started corresponding,
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.840]   I'd written a little Apple script for the radio show
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.800]   to tell me it's time to wrap.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.120]   And he said, you should take a look,
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.960]   'cause I never, you know, as a network show now,
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.640]   I have to wrap exactly at the right time.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.880]   And so now I use my little Apple script to do it.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.240]   He said, you should look at FlexTime to do that,
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:10.040]   but it won't do exactly what I need to do.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:14.720]   So, anyway, no danger, you're gonna use that app
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.440]   during this show, huh, Leo?
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.160]   - Yeah, well, I use it, but I ignore it.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160]   That's exactly right.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.840]   (laughing)
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.880]   So there's my pick, Mars Edit,
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.520]   I think Daniel's, it's a good hands in like,
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.640]   you're right, that Merlin, a little bonus ad there
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.880]   for FlexTime.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.680]   Merlin, you have a programming like the plug?
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.640]   - Yeah, just a real quickie.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.000]   I, I believe it or not, Leo,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.360]   I was contacted today by the great Flippard one.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.200]   - Flippard?
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.520]   (baby crying)
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.080]   - The great Flippard one, no?
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:45.120]   I was contacted by Alcor, who from the creator of the
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.120]   Flippard, yeah.
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.560]   - Mr. Quicks, yeah, he contacted me
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.440]   from his hyperbaric chamber somewhere in Silicon Valley.
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.360]   - He doesn't have a name on it.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.200]   - No, he doesn't.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.120]   Well, he doesn't have a need for when he was hatched.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:55.960]   - Right.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.840]   - He, he pointed me, he saw that I had posted a
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.000]   Quicksilver tutorial today on the Merlin show,
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.280]   and we talked about that a little bit,
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.120]   and he told me about something
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.200]   I had never known about before.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.440]   You can find this tip, we'll put this in show notes,
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:12.440]   but it's dev.lipidity, L-I-P-I-D-I-T-Y.com.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.800]   It's called, it's basically, the idea here is that
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.680]   this is somebody who is moving over from Windows,
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:19.520]   and was very frustrated by the fact that there wasn't
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.320]   a right click, easy way to create a new document.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.320]   Which is understandable, and how it's kind of crazy making.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.160]   It's kind of a long story short,
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.120]   if you're a Quicksilver fan,
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.320]   definitely check out this post,
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.480]   'cause he explains something I never knew about,
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.000]   and I'm a Quicksilver nerd.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.400]   I did know that you have the ability
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.640]   inside of Quicksilver to basically,
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.200]   let's say you go to the desktop, inside of Quicksilver,
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.960]   you can then click on,
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.320]   I need to do this to actually make it happen,
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:45.160]   you can create a new file from inside of Quicksilver.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.200]   - Very cool. - I don't know if you knew that.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.040]   Okay, so if you're inside of a folder in Quicksilver,
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.160]   you just go to the next pane and type in make new.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.640]   - Right. - Now I knew about that,
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.240]   and that's pretty bad ass, but here's what I didn't know.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.880]   If you drill down into your library, your user library,
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.520]   go into application support in Quicksilver,
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.000]   again, this is all in this post,
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.240]   you can create a new folder called Templates.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.760]   Inside of Templates, you can put CSS files,
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:13.440]   HTML files, text files, your hamburger helper HTML file,
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.760]   you can put anything you want with or without content,
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.960]   you can put in there, and those become available.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.840]   Yes, and those become available from a dropdown,
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.840]   and then you get a third pane.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.840]   So you go to desktop, you hit this make file,
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.840]   and then you say, open a new instance here
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.840]   of my hamburger helper HTML file,
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.840]   and it creates it for you right there on the desktop.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.840]   So this is Fumo, is that what the program is?
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.840]   - It's a plug-in. - It's a plug-in.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   It's part of Quicksilver, but it's on vacuous virtuoso,
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.840]   is the name of the site? - Yeah, I'm looking at his blog.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.840]   - Right click does not equal new file.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.840]   - Date it, I don't see the date on here,
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.840]   but this is a great trick, because the thing everybody learns,
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.840]   if you're a Quicksilver nerd, you eventually learn that
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.840]   as much of your stuff as possible,
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.840]   as you can pipe through Quicksilver the faster you get at it.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840]   And that ability, this adds just a whole new level now
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.840]   to be able to create a document from inside of there.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.840]   - So, and he's working on something called Fumo,
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.840]   and I'm not sure exactly what it is.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:12.840]   Interesting, I'd like to know more about this guy.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.840]   Very interesting, all right, so.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:17.840]   - Fumo, this is the guy who's working on the new,
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.840]   I think what, okay, so I know what you're,
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:20.840]   I see what you're looking at.
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:24.840]   I think what is a possible prototype for a new,
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.840]   this is a new Quicksilver interface, is that right?
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.840]   - I guess, he says, it has to do with Quicksilver,
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.840]   'cause he says until Quicks, I guess this guy's a
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.840]   Quicksilver, I guess the choreographic's wizard is really what it is.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.840]   - Yeah, 'cause if you've ever used a cube,
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.840]   have you ever used a cube animation, a cube interface
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.840]   inside of Quicksilver? - Yeah.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.840]   - And this looks like a really nice Quicksilver plugin.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.840]   Very cool. - Yeah.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.840]   All right. - Okay, so that's kind of a weird one,
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.840]   but if you're a Quicksilver nerd.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.840]   - Handy. - Very handy.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.840]   - Did you write that up anywhere on Foldy 43 folders,
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.840]   or are we just gonna have to listen over?
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:01.840]   - I will make that a post on my web blog,
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:02.840]   or blog for tomorrow.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.840]   - Would you, 'cause it would make it easier for me,
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.840]   'cause I'm gonna otherwise, I'm gonna have to listen to this podcast
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:07.840]   like five times a bit.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:08.840]   - I shot who in the what now?
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:09.840]   - And where do I go with it?
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.840]   All right, it's got born, what's your software pick today?
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.840]   - Well, it's a hardware pick.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:15.840]   That's how soft it is.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.840]   - Ooh.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.840]   - I'm going with another mouse.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:24.840]   I was, you know, I've, I've, a couple times referenced the logic tech mice.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.840]   I was on another podcast talking about them,
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.840]   saying that I wish that I could use them when I want to do presentations.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:34.840]   I was doing a podcast about photography and talking about advancing slide shows, et cetera.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.840]   And I got pointed to the gyration, geo 2.4,
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840]   cordless optical air mouse.
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.840]   And what I was immediately attracted to was the words air mouse,
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:49.840]   because frankly, I didn't think I'd ever seen those two words juxtaposed against each other in that manner.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:53.840]   And turns out that you can actually use this mouse in the air.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.840]   - The way that newbies do, like where they hold it up in the air and move it around.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:57.840]   - Exactly.
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.840]   So if you, if you're an air guitarist,
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.840]   you will immediately be able to use this mouse because you'll have air skills.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.840]   And actually to tell you, it works.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.840]   It's a wireless mouse and you can, you can use it on a desktop like you would expect,
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.840]   but you can also use it in the air through some sort of Disney like magic
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.840]   that makes little creatures turn into mice.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.840]   - So it has like an accelerometer or something?
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.840]   - You know, accelerometer is way too big a word for me, Merlin.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.840]   - It sounds cool.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.840]   - It actually does have a, it know, it's kind of like the Wii moat.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:30.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.840]   - It has a nose word is in space and it's very, it's a very cool mouse.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.840]   - And it's only like $65, $62 something.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.840]   - It works with a Mac.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:42.840]   - It does in fact work with a Mac as tested by Scott Born.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:43.840]   - Excellent.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.840]   That's one thing that kind of kept me off of it because I wasn't sure if it would.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.840]   The other thing is that it is right handed.
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:52.840]   - Well, all mice are right handed because everybody's right handed, Leo.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.840]   - Oh, that's why.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:55.840]   - Didn't you know?
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.840]   - Are you a left you, Justine?
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.840]   - I am.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.840]   - I knew I believed you.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.840]   - Oh, there's the reason for the two of them right there.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.840]   - No, and isn't it a problem Justine?
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:08.840]   Because a lot of the best mice are you can't use because your hand doesn't fit it.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.840]   - It is, but I don't use my mouse with my left hand.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:12.840]   - Oh, you're right hand mouse.
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:13.840]   You see, I wish I had done that.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840]   - Yeah.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840]   - If I were your age, but there weren't mice when I was your age.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.840]   In fact, really frankly, there weren't mice until I was in my 50s.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.840]   So, I'm really kind of stuck with a left.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   - I thought you were going to say you didn't use a mouse at all.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.840]   There was one more way in which you were--
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.840]   - Yeah, I was waiting for that too.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.840]   I was waiting for that too, it's right up there.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.840]   She does I am instead of email.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:36.840]   She does thought transfer instead of using a mouse.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:39.840]   - You know, it's a funny story because when I was in middle school,
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.840]   and if I would get grounded by my mom, she would take my mouse away from me.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840]   So, that's how.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.840]   So, I was like, you know, whatever, I don't need that.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.840]   So, I just learned all kinds of keyboard shortcuts.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.840]   And then she found out that I knew all the shortcuts.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.840]   - So, she took your fingers.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.840]   - So, she cut my fingers off.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.840]   No, she didn't.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.840]   So, she took the keyboard away and then finally,
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.840]   I couldn't do an extra keyboard, but I did have an extra mouse.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.840]   So, I would type in keycaps and copy and paste so that I could chat with you.
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.840]   - You were a-- - Oh, man.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.840]   - One of those nutty girls.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.840]   - And she went-- - That's so awesome.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.840]   - And then she learned how to do the Vulcan mind-milled with the computer right after that.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.840]   - Yes.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:22.840]   - Wow.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.840]   All right.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.840]   - Oh, wow.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.840]   - Wow.
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.840]   - Annie and I go, a software pick from you, my friend.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:33.840]   - Well, what I used to do is I used to un-bend a paperclip and short the contacts on the key scanner.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.840]   - Yeah.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   - Baskards, take away my USB port.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.840]   - Oh.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:47.840]   - My software pick is-- it's kind of an example of stuff that there's-- there's the software that's out for, like, a year, year and a half, two years.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   But then, you don't really use it because you don't need it.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.840]   Then the time comes, you need it and that's the best thing in the world to you.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.840]   For me, it's a program-- a piece of software from PictureCode calls it called Noise Ninja.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:04.840]   It's a photo app that either will work as a standalone app or as a plugin for Photoshop or any app that takes Photoshop plugins.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:12.840]   And this whole point is to take, like, high compression noise or take low light sensitive noise and just eliminates it.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.840]   - Wow.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:20.840]   - So many times-- I've been shooting pictures of my niece, my beloved nieces, hockey games, and took a picture.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:26.840]   And you got to use the highest-- almost the highest ISO that your camera can deal with because there's no lighting in there.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.840]   It's really fast action.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.840]   And it comes out really, really well for the web.
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:35.840]   But unfortunately, last week, I took a really, really incredibly good shot of the goalie, like, making this immaculate save
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:44.840]   that the team now wants to come in together and, like, make an 8x10 out of it, make it as a present to the goalie who's been making up for certain shortcomings in the defense.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.840]   So-- and I'm like, "Oh, for God's sakes, no, no, don't print that, don't print that."
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.840]   So downloaded noise ninja.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:57.840]   And the thing is, again, because it's using this really low light, high sensitivity mode, there's all kinds of, like, multicolored rainbow static
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.840]   and every single part of the thing when you try to print it.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:08.840]   But with noise ninja, it actually gives you a five second mode where it says, "Okay, click this, open the file, click this button right here,
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.840]   then click the Remove Noise feature.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:13.840]   If it looks okay, click this button and you're done."
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.840]   And just that will remove 50% of all your pain inside this picture.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:23.840]   If you want to be more clever, you can use the, what they call, the five minute mode, which allows you to say, "Well, tell you what,
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.840]   I want you to take everything out of this-- there's all this noise in the sky, so it'll be really, really aggressive about removing from the sky,
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.840]   but now there's this kind of Hawaiian shirt in the foreground.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:38.840]   Don't be quite so aggressive because if you're too aggressive with the noise reduction, it'll look like watercolor-y at the-- at its most extreme.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:44.840]   But it's basically able to take almost any pictures you took and make it look like you shot it at like five times the resolution
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:48.840]   or at like 100 ISO at the most beautiful setting possible.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:51.840]   So it really will take-- it turns trash into treasure.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.840]   It's definitely worth the 35 bucks at a cost for a single person.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:59.840]   I'm looking at the sample images on the picture code site and if-- does it really as good as those images?
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:00.840]   Because that's amazing.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.840]   It really is.
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:06.840]   I'm used to software not working because I know that life is a veil of tears.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:11.840]   But again, the quick five second version, I'm like, "Okay, it can't be that easy. Clearly I've screwed something up."
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.840]   But no, it actually did it really, really well.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:20.840]   It definitely got better when I learned how to use the program a little bit, learned how to basically twiddle the sliders a bit to get it to work better.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.840]   But you really can get really, really wonderful results.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:28.840]   All this static and-- and mung and junk will just be-- it's like you windex the front of the images.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.840]   Also cheap.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.840]   I mean, relatively for Photoshop plugin, it's not expensive.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:42.840]   They're very, very smart because they realize probably that there are lots of like desktop home users who just want to-- again, they've shot pictures of their kid or pictures of their-- at their kids high school play or whatever.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.840]   And they just want to fix these pictures.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.840]   Well, you can get this affordable $35 version.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.840]   If you're a professional, you can spring for the $90 version.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:53.840]   We can install it on like 100 different computers and it'll give you all kinds of different profiles and such.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:58.840]   But again, it is just-- for 35 bucks, you just can't beat it. It raises the dead on you.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:06.840]   Okay, three finger is Eric. You got a-- you can still say I don't have a software program or-- or--
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.840]   I do.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:09.840]   Kind of.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:15.840]   Well, you know, I like verb. So I don't know, did you install verb tunes yet?
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:16.840]   No, what's that?
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:23.840]   Ooh, well, it's a software plugin for iTunes and anything that you play, it'll track it and post it on your profile.
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:29.840]   So it's kind of like Last FM, but I don't know if you guys know also that verb was by the creators of Pure Volume.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:32.840]   So it will also help you out and they'll have the artists on verb.
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.840]   It'll let you know when they're playing nearby and recommend new music.
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.840]   Oh, very cool. What is Pure Volume?
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:47.840]   Well, it's a website that just-- it's pretty much kind of like the MySpace music site, but it's just for music.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.840]   So--
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.840]   There seems to be-- there seems to be-- oh, yeah, it looks just like Pure Volume.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:57.840]   It seems to-- obviously they have a-- like MySpace, a big musical component on verb, but it's also picture.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.840]   I mean, it's kind of like flicker meets--
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:00.840]   Yes.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.840]   You know, MySpace meets a bunch of other stuff, so it's kind of neat.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.840]   Well, cool, all right.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.840]   So that's my pick.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:09.840]   I don't ever listen to iTunes stuff, so I wouldn't use it, but if you do--
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:10.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:11.840]   If you do.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:13.840]   Let's see, everybody's done their picks, right?
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:14.840]   Yes.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.840]   We've all wind those of us who feel like it.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:22.840]   I do want to plug Merlin's-- the merlinshow.com.
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.840]   You've been doing some great stuff.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.840]   There's a Quicksilver commas thingambob that you must see.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.840]   You must go see.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.840]   And a new one, Quicksilver Proxies.
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:34.840]   So you're just--
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:35.840]   Yeah, that's mind blowing.
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.840]   Yeah, a lot of people don't make-- Proxies even exist.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:43.840]   It allows you to make commands and triggers around things like current application or finder selection.
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.840]   So if you can get your head around that, you can do some pretty mind blowing stuff.
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:51.840]   Justine could have used it in middle school because you could have all the menus show up on--
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:52.840]   Two fingers.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:53.840]   Two fingers.
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.840]   Where was this then?
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:55.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:56.840]   God.
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:57.840]   My hands hurt.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:02.840]   That's the merlinshow.com, and it is a great show.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.840]   Well, it's turning out to be really interesting.
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.840]   A broad variety of stuff.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.840]   I mean, you've got Jonathan Colton interview, part two, Quicksilver screen cast.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:13.840]   I mean, it's just going to be-- it's getting more and more interesting all the time.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:14.840]   Thanks.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:17.840]   So, Scott Borne is, of course, Mr. iPhone.
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:20.840]   That's probably why he has that iPhone site.
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:21.840]   What is it again?
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:22.840]   iPhone.
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:23.840]   ApplephoneShow.com.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.840]   ApplephoneShow.com.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:29.840]   And we have a clean picture of Antonella Barbara on the blog today.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.840]   Oh, did you not have one earlier?
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.840]   No, we've always had one on the blog.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:35.840]   OK.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.840]   That's the one.
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:42.840]   And by the way, I just wanted to mention Leo that we've had four episodes of Gear Media Tech
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:44.840]   so far, which is our audience.
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:45.840]   We've got to plug that thing.
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:46.840]   I'm so sorry.
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:47.840]   You never mention it.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:48.840]   You're on it.
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:49.840]   I feel terrible.
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.840]   Pixelcore.tv.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:55.840]   Gear Media Tech is our new podcast about podcasting tools, and it's fantastic.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.840]   And Scott and Alex and I do it.
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:00.840]   And we've already got four episodes up.
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.840]   I didn't even know that.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.840]   Yeah, you want to watch one or two of them sometime.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.840]   Pixelcore.tv.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:07.840]   I ought to.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.840]   I could learn a thing or two about how to do this.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.840]   And of course, don't forget our cot.
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:11.840]   There are.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.840]   Believe it or not, I'm kind of surprised.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840]   Still room at the conference.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.840]   We are going to limit it to 150 people, but there is.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:19.840]   Yeah, but we had quite a surge last week.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.840]   Oh, good.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:21.840]   I'm glad to hear that.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.840]   In ticket sales.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.840]   So we still have room, but not maybe for long.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:25.840]   Don't waste time.
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.840]   If you go to the front page at twit.tv, we've got a link there.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:35.840]   Or just go to pixelcore.com and click the register now link because time is running out.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.840]   Running out.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.840]   Christine is of course tasty blog snack.com.
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.840]   Right now.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.840]   Not blogspot, but.com.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:45.840]   Dot com.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.840]   Dot com.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:47.840]   All right.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.840]   No more blogspot.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:49.840]   The hell with your blogspot.
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.840]   By the way, we didn't explicit tag this one.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.840]   I don't think we got very explicit, did we?
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840]   You want a reason to?
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:57.840]   [laughter]
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.840]   I can step on this tack.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:00.840]   I've got the other bluer.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:01.840]   I can still mess this up.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:02.840]   We got time left.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:10.840]   Tastyblogsnack.com and mommypackmylunch.com is where she's got some great videos online.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.840]   And very, very, very funny Twitter too.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.840]   She's a very fun person to watch on Twitter.
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:15.840]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.840]   Is it I, Justine, is your Twitter name?
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.840]   Yes, it is.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:21.840]   And we won't publish grandma's name, but she's not.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.840]   Yeah, she might be upset.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.840]   So cool.
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.840]   I want to be your friend.
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:27.840]   All right.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:28.840]   Be your friend.
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.840]   Andy Inaco is not on Twitter, but he does have every Mac.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:33.840]   Every Mac ever made.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.840]   And they're all powered up right now.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.840]   I don't need Fred's.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.840]   I've got every back ever made.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:39.840]   Share my Fred's.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:40.840]   Shut up.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.840]   Lilith and Lilith too.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.840]   And cwob.com, the colossal waste of bandwidth.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.840]   Actually, is it www.cwob.com?
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:55.840]   I believe there's also an HTTP colon, a backslash, and I think a second backslash.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:56.840]   I don't know.
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:57.840]   I would.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.840]   I'm not very big on the technology.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:00.840]   I just write about it.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.840]   Another Mac break.
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.840]   He's broke.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.840]   Something.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.840]   Never can't come up with a good.
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.840]   Bracy Glues or Winter Leather.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.840]   What's almost every show together?
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:19.840]   [Music]
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:26.840]   [Music]
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:32.840]   [Music]
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:37.840]   [Music]
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:47.840]   [Music]
