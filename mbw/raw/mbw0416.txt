[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.280]   We're gonna talk about the latest Mac,
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.940]   rumors, Apple rumors.
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.040]   And whether there's gonna be a new Apple TV I say,
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.780]   might be soon.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.880]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.560]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.920]   The show-- I don't know why I did that.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280]   Why not add those extra syllables?
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.520]   The show where we cover the latest stuff from Apple,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.920]   Renee Ritchie is on a plane to nowhere--
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.640]   evidently without strong enough Wi-Fi.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.000]   You know, Renee, you could Wi-Fi in.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.880]   That's a very good point.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.400]   Fortunately, Alex Lindsey's here.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.680]   His Wi-Fi signal is so good he looks like he's here in the flesh.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.400]   Coming in all the way from Rwanda with a special background.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.160]   In your dreams.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.000]   I should do that.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.800]   I should take a picture while I'm here.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.360]   You know what, too?
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.920]   Would you get to get the backdrop?
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.440]   I'll get that.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.640]   And then I'll put it in a screen behind me in Rwanda.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.840]   And then we'll just-- we'll never know.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.800]   Just get out of the way.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.640]   Just get out of the frame right now.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.400]   And I'll just screen grab--
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.560]   No, really get out of the frame.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.320]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   No, but there's bodies in there.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.920]   We'll do that.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.120]   We'll do that.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.600]   We'll do that.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.120]   We'll figure that out.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.960]   That would be very funny.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.560]   And then I wouldn't know.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.600]   And then-- but Chad, we'll have to do something here,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.120]   like a holographic effect.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.280]   That's Andy and not Kofa in the Chicago Sun.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.320]   Time sitting there with his Atari computer.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.280]   The ISO-- ISO minimal polygon render of a Commodore 64,
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.120]   I believe.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.620]   I don't know.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.240]   That's an Atari joystick, I think.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.760]   Were they compatible?
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.800]   What happened there?
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.320]   Sorry.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.560]   Yeah, I think maybe they were compatible.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.200]   Yeah, maybe they were compatible.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.560]   Oh, why do you have a minimalist isomorphic rendering
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.360]   of a Commodore computer?
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.840]   Because it's really cool.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.320]   There's an artist whose hobby is to do really great CGI models,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.680]   but with minimal polygons.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.440]   And so by doing--
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.440]   I love that.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.040]   By doing the Simpsons house and the Bob's Burgers house
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.400]   and lighthouses and movie scenes, where it's not
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.280]   going to be hyper, hyper-detailed,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.560]   it's just such a nice New Yorker cartoon style version of CGI.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.040]   It's like, oh, isn't that delightful?
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.800]   I'm thinking, though.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   You think it's Commodore?
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.640]   Because Atari had those buttons on the right.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.400]   I'm just fixating on the color scheme.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.480]   I don't recall Atari having anything that was--
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.520]   it wasn't that almost like a dark, dark chocolate black.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.720]   And with a stripe of metal on the very, very top edge
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.480]   above the key.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.840]   OK, maybe.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.800]   OK.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.040]   You know how I know?
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.640]   That was my beloved.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.400]   My one and only, my truly, my first-- actually, the 400
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.520]   is my first.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.520]   This was my second.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.040]   Atari 800.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.600]   Hey.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.360]   Love this.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.320]   I jumped straight from the Commodore to the Apple.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.840]   It's funny.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.480]   You know--
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.640]   Now I get it.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.800]   For those of you listening at home, forget it.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.600]   It's not-- you didn't miss anything.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.560]   So speaking of not missing anything,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.520]   the ice bucket challenge has now spread through Apple
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.560]   like a virus, like Ebola.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.400]   It started with-- I shouldn't say that.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.000]   That's probably-- it started with Phil Schiller on the beach
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.480]   with his BC shirt.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.880]   You'll like that, Andy, Boston College.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.320]   And I guess it's not a video.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.280]   It's just him and a tweet.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.640]   One man, one tweet.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.760]   He challenged Tim Cook along with Chris O'Donnell
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.160]   and Pete Freitas.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.560]   Cook did it at a beer bash, at the Apple beer bash.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.560]   Here we go.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.160]   Here we go.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.600]   Here we go.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   That's-- he's already wet.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.760]   Let's start over here.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.520]   Do you have my audio?
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.840]   Is that not working either?
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.080]   My third and final challenge.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.960]   This is the ice ice that you were enjoying.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.320]   And I want to see you in ice.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.120]   Is it?
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.480]   I think you're already past it.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.560]   Oprah Winfrey.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.920]   Oprah Winfrey.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.480]   Tim challenged-- there we go.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.640]   Tim challenged this performer after he did the ice bucket
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.200]   challenge.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.680]   I'm not sure this might be the first time we've actually
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.400]   seen the toes of an Apple CEO during an event.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.920]   He's wearing sandals, flip flops.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.560]   There you go.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.280]   That's very casual.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   What do you call it?
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.040]   He's a casual fella.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.480]   By the way, this is shot professionally.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.120]   I just want to point out.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.280]   This is not hand held.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.160]   It's one of the few ice bucket videos
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.360]   I've seen that is actually shot in landscape mode.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.640]   I heard you get to pick three or fill pick three,
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.480]   so I'm going to do it too.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.800]   He seems rather affable and a-bunkular.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.200]   Turn it up.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.680]   Turn up.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.240]   You need to turn up your YouTube player.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.840]   It's my fault.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.400]   My YouTube player is too low.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.840]   It's way down there.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.000]   Well, let's hear it again.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.960]   And the crowd's shouting suggests--
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.800]   Dr. Dre.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   Dr. Dre.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.200]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.240]   Who's been known to make a few videos.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.960]   And he's one of us now.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.920]   By the way, that's a little shot at him,
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.720]   because wasn't it Dr. Dre's Facebook video,
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.280]   because later--
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.440]   --because later trouble--
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.520]   --caused all the trouble with during the Beats acquisition.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.200]   He's been known to make videos.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.320]   Dr. Dre, I'm talking to you, Dre.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.560]   Secondly--
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.280]   God, they draw this out.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.560]   Bob Iger.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.480]   Bob Iger, who is the chairman of Disney.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.200]   CEO of Disney.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.040]   CEO.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:02.000]   And one of my friends and one of our board members.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.520]   And number three.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.120]   Lorraine Jobs.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.120]   Michael Fronté.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.120]   I love Michael Fronté.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.680]   Is that who that is?
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.760]   And he has to do it today.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.760]   He's of--
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.160]   Sanford's a very famous--
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.960]   we saw him at Bottle Rock.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.160]   He was with San Francisco activist rock group--
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.200]   I want to say, burning spearables.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.800]   Fronté Raps.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.080]   Really, really, he's got good flow.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.840]   That's pretty good.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.840]   Their beer bash features Michael Fronté.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:49.720]   Oh, that's a mini bucket.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.560]   To be fair, doesn't have to be an igloo cooler.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.480]   Am I wrong?
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.400]   It's grown to that.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.080]   This isn't key.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.840]   This isn't-- you can't do that on television, Leo.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.560]   It's just-- it's all he has to be covered in misquists
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.440]   fluid for anything.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   I believe--
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.640]   He's got-- he's got--
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.400]   The official challenge has to be with an igloo cooler.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.600]   I'm sorry, but I believe that's the case.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.080]   So Dre picked up the challenge.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.480]   How do you feel like?
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.000]   You good.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.080]   You good?
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.600]   OK.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.160]   Ooh.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160]   OK.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.600]   Oh, man, that's big.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   OK, Tim Cook.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.360]   I accept your challenge, and I challenge him.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.080]   By the way, he wins the professional film crew challenge
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.920]   as well.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.240]   I don't know.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.240]   He definitely is high up there.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.120]   There's been a lot of people putting a lot of production
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.800]   into these.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.920]   Bill Gates welded his own rig.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.440]   There you go.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.840]   Or at least pretended to.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.400]   He's got the Alton Brown deep fryer turkey rig up there, I think.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.840]   That thing-- look at the size of that tub.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.720]   Let's go back here.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.440]   That's a massive tub.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.040]   That thing-- that's got to be--
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.640]   It's actually not that complex rig.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.600]   We have a troupe here in the US.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.080]   Exactly.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.200]   That's a pretty straightforward film rig.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.320]   Those are just-- those are standard stands.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.040]   So that was actually probably easier than what Bill Gates did.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.440]   Yeah, because he didn't have to weld anything.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.360]   It looks like they're on location doing so many ways.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.800]   I like the giant boom mic.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.300]   Yep.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.480]   Keeps that out of the water.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.680]   There's got a big zebly doing it.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.520]   Keeps that out of the water.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.520]   I think they shot this on an airflex.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.560]   OK, Tim Cook.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.640]   I accept your challenge, and I challenge M&M, Snoop Dogg,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.560]   and Kendrick Lamar.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.360]   All right, Gary.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   Let's go.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.800]   This is really good at it.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   All right.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.680]   48 gallons of ice and water.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.000]   It is lab.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It is lab.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.040]   You got to hit the head.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.480]   All right.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.520]   Although, actually, braver to get it in the lab.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.280]   Actually, that was-- that's got to be one of the nicest
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.160]   soaking I've seen.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.920]   And I've seen--
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.960]   That was pretty thorough.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.960]   --upward to seven of these.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.920]   When you add slow motion to your--
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.600]   That's by the way, that's requisite, isn't it?
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.720]   If you don't add slow motion--
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.320]   You know, if you do it, Leo, I'll film it in slow motion.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.080]   I'm done, man.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   I'm done.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.120]   In fact, I went on and on for like an hour
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.320]   about why I wasn't going to do it.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.080]   Then you broke down.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.160]   And I broke down and did it.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.360]   It's peer pressure.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.920]   So everybody at Apple is now--
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.840]   it really spreads fast, this thing.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.280]   I think they say now, what did they say?
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.200]   There were some huge number of people on Facebook,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.640]   like 12 million videos on Facebook or something.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.240]   This is all we should mention to benefit
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.160]   the ALS Association fighting Lou Gehrig's disease,
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.760]   which is a horrific disease.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.320]   It's always fatal, I believe.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.960]   We have a family friend whose dad passed away
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.600]   not so many years ago that way.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.560]   And it's fast.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.560]   And he was young.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.960]   He was in his 40s.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.360]   So, OK, enough of that.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.400]   That's Mac News, though.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.960]   Shiller, Cook.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.400]   I wonder if they could find--
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.280]   Didn't they get-- didn't they get--
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.760]   weren't there girls that got fined somewhere in California
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.600]   for doing the--
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.440]   Poposi's Facebook?
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.280]   I think that's it.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.080]   You know, because--
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.240]   Even at Apple, Robert's going to--
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240]   We have a major drought.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.320]   There's cities in California that soon
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.040]   that will be completely without water.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.880]   Like, there's no water.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.200]   Of course, they call it a drought,
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.960]   but it's really just a trend.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.120]   Yeah, yeah, don't say that, please.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.920]   I wonder if Jimmy Iovine has done it.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.640]   How come he wasn't challenged?
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.080]   I want to see Snoop's challenge.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.440]   All right.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:28.400]   Yeah, there's no-- as to date, no video of Jimmy Iovine
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.480]   taking the challenge.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.560]   All right, hello, everybody.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.680]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.280]   We are now going to move on to actual Apple news.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.960]   Apple wins an Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.320]   Want to see the Outstanding Commercial?
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.520]   It's the one we all talked about over Christmas.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.080]   It was great.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.040]   Misunderstood.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.120]   Remember this?
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.000]   The Pork Kid.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.480]   This sounds like sad tweet music.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.520]   Oh, no, it's cheering up.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.760]   They're coming for Christmas.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.560]   Get ready, by the way.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.320]   December's only a few months off.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.440]   It's coming again.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.720]   I think there's auto play music.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.640]   There's two music--
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   There's something else going.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.280]   Yeah, I don't know where that's coming from.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.840]   I think this is not the same.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.680]   Can you please call down?
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   It's a nice bucket challenge to stamp that out as well.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.160]   Don't you hate that when they--
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.040]   Yeah, there's another video on--
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.040]   There's three video--
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.400]   There's a video below that one.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.840]   What the hell's wrong with this?
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.880]   This is what's wrong with--
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.880]   This is one we can't have nice things.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.400]   There's another video there.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.960]   No wonder it was so noisy.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.480]   God.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   Good fight.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.240]   And they put a lot of auto play.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.320]   And they're all on auto play.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.000]   Thank you, 9 to 5, Mac.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.160]   What the hell?
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.240]   So somebody cut and pasted the embed code.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.960]   I am now slowly going through all these videos.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.040]   Impressive toss.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.040]   You can't multitask like the young people can.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.240]   There's no reason to be bitter.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.080]   Save time.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.360]   Watch five commercials at once.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.720]   I say we're going to do that all at one time.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.880]   You've got to put them all next to each other, like in a little grid.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.600]   This show brought to you by Gazelle Squarespace IT Pro TV.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.080]   Actually, to be accurate, Andy and I
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.200]   would have to be saying the other ads at the same time
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.040]   that you're doing your ad.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.480]   Let's do it this time.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.080]   All three of them.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:07.280]   OK, yeah.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.440]   Save a lot of time that way.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.080]   Exactly.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.480]   And you pick the ad your ear wants to hear one and one
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   and one and the other ear.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.240]   And then rest go up your nose.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.640]   Anyway, you know what the ad was.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.760]   And actually, it is a great ad.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.320]   I think it deserves an Emmy Award.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.520]   I didn't know that actually there
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.120]   were outstanding commercial Emmy Awards.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.240]   Yes.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.760]   There's an Emmy Award for pretty much everything.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.800]   I have friends at Emmys.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.520]   And it's surprising how many how many verticals.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.320]   I have an Emmy Award for Best Soccer Puppet.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:32.920]   Or whatever.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.680]   What is mine for?
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.400]   Specialty Act.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.800]   And I was competing against the soccer puppet.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.080]   Who are you?
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.880]   Dev Noll, a virtual reality singer.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.200]   That's right.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:42.840]   So you're right.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.760]   There really is every category possible.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.080]   But this one deserves an Emmy, I guess.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.440]   I mean, it probably is one of the great ads of the year.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.920]   Remember, it's the--
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.400]   There it is.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.040]   The emo kid who's at the family holiday.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.840]   And you feel like, oh, he's not paying attention.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   He's always buried in his iPhone, annoying teenagers.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.880]   All this stuff's happening.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.240]   And then, of course, they turn it around,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.760]   because as they all gather, he turns on the TV and says,
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.360]   watch this.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.240]   Made a video.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.240]   Make a comment.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.640]   And this whole time, they thought he was
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.080]   shooting vertical video.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.040]   He, in fact, somehow magically was shooting horizontal video.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.880]   I'll let the magic happen.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.120]   I'm sorry, I know.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.600]   I'm such a scrooge.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.960]   The only complaint I had about it is that I wish that if this
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.480]   is 95 points out of 100, they would have gotten 100
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.040]   if it made it a little bit more clear that he wasn't
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.880]   ignoring his family for three days.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.880]   We could shoot this video.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.760]   This was just-- we're all over seeing
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.440]   are the moments where he's shooting video.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.160]   Other than that, he was completely there
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.120]   and completely present.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.560]   Yeah, except he wasn't.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.080]   He was actually playing Frogger.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.760]   Oh, no.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.960]   We could think that they're just showing us clips of the times
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.200]   and he was focusing on the fun video.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.040]   Right, just when he was playing Flappy Bird.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.240]   There should be-- you know what?
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.600]   There should be a Flappy Bird commercial, where he's actually
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.360]   no, I'm not making a video.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.520]   Jimmy, Jimmy, come here.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.800]   Let's see the video you've been making.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.400]   No, I've been playing Flappy Bird, but look, I got 16.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.920]   Stop it, Bird.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.640]   Jimmy, Bird.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.480]   All right, I ruined it.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.560]   I'm just trying to hook me into doing it in a purchase.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.120]   This game stinks.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.360]   I was all excited because I saw this wonderful update
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.960]   executive profiles page.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.760]   And I was all excited doing Kremlinology
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.840]   because there's Angela Arendt's right up next to Tim Cook,
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.920]   the prime position.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.760]   And then Jason Snell points out, no, no, it's just alphabetical
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.680]   order.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.920]   She begins with an A.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.800]   I thought, Johnny, I've got to be pissed.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.000]   He's undercooked.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.960]   Angela's on his right hand, man.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.520]   But no, it's just alphabetic.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.640]   However, some revelations here, they finally
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.160]   acknowledge that Jeff Badoni is a vice president and dean
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   of Apple University, which was thanks to that--
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.200]   He's been there quite some time.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.480]   He's been there for years, but he came from Yale
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.600]   School of Management.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.360]   But now he's got the card.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.360]   Well, it was a New York Times article out of him,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.040]   so I guess they figured what might as well put him.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.440]   And there's Paul Denev from Yves Saint-D'Alle.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.360]   He's a vice president of Special Pojé.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   That would be--
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.120]   Pojé's yeah.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.360]   I will say that's got to be one of the best jobs at Apple
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.560]   is the head of special projects.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.480]   Yes.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.240]   Everyone knows that you're like the CIA of Apple.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:34.120]   Well, he almost should just wear really expensive dark sunglasses
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.640]   and never take them off and make people hypothesize
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.400]   that he is actually a robot of some kind.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.000]   Or something from the mainstream.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.680]   A little something in his ear.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.040]   That would start the rumors.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.720]   I would have a little smoke machine to just put a little bit
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.920]   of smoke come out of my bathroom.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.640]   I'm going to play it back in my jacket while I'm walking along
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.560]   and people would just, you know, little puffs of smoke.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.080]   Little puffs.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.360]   What is he doing?
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.760]   I'm seeing--
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.440]   I see you're eating food with a fork.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:02.680]   I've already spoken too much, but enjoy your utensils.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.080]   What they really need is a chief disinformation officer.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.800]   Apple does-- I mean, OK, as long as we're going to do this,
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.920]   because obviously, when we know that Denev is probably
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.400]   the eye watch guy or one of the eye watch guys, right?
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.200]   That's the special project.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.600]   Or do we?
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.960]   We assume that that's connected.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.840]   Apple has filed yet another patent
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.480]   that I think goes right in there with the fork, the special fork.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.160]   A patent for a curved touch display.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.200]   Pat and Lee Apple says, it could support a future fitness
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.640]   band or eye watch.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.280]   I don't think these are meaningless these patents, aren't they?
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.880]   It's hard to know which ones to take seriously.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.320]   They patent everything.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.840]   Didn't we read the scene where the lawyers come and they ask you,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.720]   what are you been doing?
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.640]   OK, we can patent that.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.360]   Yeah, we can patent that.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.240]   Yeah, we can patent that.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.920]   Wasn't that Apple that we read that about?
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.200]   Apple's legal team.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.840]   Well, they've got a whole building, probably, of people.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.360]   Well, the big thing is they get sued.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.680]   You know, they--
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.280]   It's defensive.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.920]   So a lot of it's defensive.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.640]   I mean, obviously, some of it's offensive.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.520]   They've proven that.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   But a lot of this is all just making sure that you said
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.680]   you thought of it at a certain time,
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.320]   so that someone else isn't claiming against you later.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.440]   Speaking of which--
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:14.940]   Also.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.160]   Speaking of patent trolls, we want to congratulate and thank
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.960]   Adam Corolla.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.400]   He has apparently settled now with the podcasting patent
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:22.920]   troll.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.880]   It's kind of one of those good news bad news things.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.400]   The good news is that lawsuit is over.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.560]   The bad news is the reason that lawsuit is over
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.880]   is because podcasts make so little money that the patent troll
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.720]   realized there was no point in suing.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.220]   Yay?
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:41.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.800]   What are we doing here?
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.960]   This is why I stay in print journalism, Leo.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.760]   This is why I drive a 10-year-old car
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.120]   and make sure people know I drive a 10-year-old car.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.440]   The good news is the patent troll dropped the lawsuit.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.960]   The bad news is they dropped it because there's
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.160]   no money in podcasting.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.440]   So what is there to say about this?
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.120]   Nothing.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.360]   Congratulations, Adam.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.800]   We thank you for fighting the good fight.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.000]   And really, a lot of credit goes to Adams.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.200]   By the way, Miami just appeared.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.640]   I was going to do the rest of the show this way.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.600]   A lot of those--
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.080]   a lot of credit goes to Adams listeners
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.440]   who raised half a million dollars for his defense.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.560]   And in EFF's article about this, they
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.840]   say that there's good news, but the bad news for them is--
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.600]   and for Adam is he--
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.200]   by dropping the case, he's eliminating the opportunity
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.040]   to try to get fees back.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.800]   That money's shot.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.320]   Shot the hell.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.520]   And that's what patent trolls do.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.440]   This is not unusual.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.600]   A lot of times, they don't want to go to trial
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.400]   in case the trial invalidates to patent.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.200]   They're hoping that you'll just cave before an Adam didn't cave.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.400]   And that's why we're grateful to him.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.000]   Thank you, Adam.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.080]   And now they know there's no money in podcasting.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.080]   [SNAP]
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.080]   [SNAP]
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.080]   Anti-poaching law.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.480]   The court-- the Department of Justice
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.400]   had settled with all the big companies.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.600]   And now people are suing Apple for--
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.360]   Well, the court on Friday overturned the DOJ settlement.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.040]   Judge--
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.400]   Judge Lucy Coe said 325 million.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.200]   That's nothing.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.640]   Peanuts.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.000]   So Apple's back in-- going to go back in court.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.600]   There'll be a trial over that.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.760]   And now there's a lawsuit.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.080]   And I think they're right.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.800]   This is the smoking gun from 2009.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.480]   The hands-off do not call us.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.080]   So for those of you not following along, this was--
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.480]   but it was highly illegal.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.120]   It's a violation of the anti-trust act.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.280]   Apple had agreed with a lot of other companies,
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.280]   including Microsoft and Adobe.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.320]   Hey, if you don't try to hire our engineers,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.200]   we won't try to hire your engineers.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.720]   And the benefit to the company is
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.240]   multifold.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.000]   The reason it's a violation of anti-trust
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.560]   is because it hurts the employees who can't chop themselves.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.200]   They can't say, well, how much would you pay me Adobe?
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.440]   Because Adobe says, well, we're not going to talk to you.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.480]   So this is the do not call list from Apple.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.160]   Microsoft, Garmin, Palm, Adobe, Aspire, AMD,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.840]   ATI, Best Buy CDW, singular CompUSA.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.640]   Come on, really?
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.280]   CompUSA was CompUSA poaching a lot of Apple employees.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.160]   Foxconn, Genentech, Google Ingram Intel, and two at J.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:34.760]   Crew, MacZone, Nike, NVIDIA PC connection, PC mall, Pixar,
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.160]   of course, Lucas, Quanta, Tech Data, and Zones.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.000]   So this is illegal.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.400]   And the court has now said we're going to go back to trial.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.640]   Because Judge Coe said that 325 million was not fair.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.920]   And I imagine this is a class action lawsuit.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.280]   It's seeking damages on behalf of shareholders
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.480]   for financial losses related to misconduct by senior directors,
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.520]   including Steve Jobs and Tim Cook.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   So this goes on and may cost Apple a lot more money.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.800]   Yeah, the most surprising thing about this
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   was how absolutely open all the CEOs were about it.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.520]   Usually, you think that they would shovel it off
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.320]   to an underlying or use coded language,
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.600]   but it was, nope, we have an agreement not to hire each other.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.680]   So make sure you head that off.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.640]   Well, I mean, I think that the hard part
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.360]   is that when you have a business a lot of times,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.480]   you don't make it official.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.280]   But there's definitely--
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.360]   I mean, I have a company, and we're very careful about who
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.800]   we hire and who we don't, based on who owns companies
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.600]   that are friends of mine.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.280]   I mean, I'm not going to sit there and start pulling people
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.040]   out of their--
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.680]   but I don't have any agreement with them.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.240]   It's not like I've got into something.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.840]   But just internally, I'm not in my thought process of that.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.280]   It would be wrong of me to go next door and say,
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.920]   hey, Pixelcore employees, who wants to work for us?
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.680]   And I don't--
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.520]   and vice versa.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.320]   But we don't have any agreement.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.320]   We don't have any discussion.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.680]   We don't discuss it, but it's not--
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.160]   But it would be considered bad blood.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.040]   You would create a lot of bad blood if you started--
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.640]   and when you're a big company, it's much different than when
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.000]   you're little companies that are just--
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.960]   Well, you can't have formal agreements, you really--
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.560]   And it's the formal agreement that got them in the--
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.920]   You've got thousands of engineers who are now basically
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.840]   held hostage because they can't go anywhere in Silicon Valley
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.720]   because you've got agreements with everybody.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.680]   That's a real pattern of--
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.120]   It seems like there's still some questions about employment
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.200]   in this industry that need to be addressed,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.160]   where companies always talk about,
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.880]   hey, we take such good care of our employees.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.480]   Look, we buy them fancy chairs and look,
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.920]   we'll take out their dry cleaning
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.960]   and look at the kitchen.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.120]   We spent $1 million a year on chicken alone in the lunchroom
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.000]   that we-- the cafeteria that we provide.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.800]   And yet, there's so many other people who say, yeah,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   but you're willing to exploit people who
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.600]   have a certain amount of enthusiasm for a project
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.800]   that they don't have any skin in themselves.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.840]   And you're willing to let them work 40, 50, 60, 70,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.320]   80 hours a week on crunch time projects.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.680]   It must feel kind of bad when you realize
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.200]   that your company was willing to give you
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.920]   the things that cost them very little.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.680]   But when it comes to putting you--
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.280]   giving you the sense that you are the captain of your own career
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.120]   and that the skills that you have proven over the past three
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.920]   or four years in this company are valuable to other companies.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.720]   And it would be nice if--
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.400]   it must-- I don't think this underlines a problem
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.880]   that Apple is having with its employees.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.240]   But it must be kind of-- for someone
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.040]   who's not feeling very appreciated in their job,
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.400]   it must be a little bit of a kick in the sensitive region
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.320]   to think that, OK, well, I've been set up
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   so that I only have to work-- I can only work here.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.000]   I can't take a better job elsewhere.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   Well, more time in court for Apple lawyers.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.400]   They must love it there.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.880]   No matter what they--
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.200]   why doesn't that executive get a slot on the official web
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.040]   page?
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.000]   Vice President of legal--
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Isn't the chief counsel on there?
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.320]   Actually, I have to look.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.040]   Whatever it ends up being, it's still
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.280]   just going to be a rounding error.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.960]   Yeah, when you've got billions-- and by the way,
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.800]   we should mention I don't hold Apple stock.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.240]   It would be an ethical failure to do so.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.920]   However, Apple stock did break 100 today.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.800]   Yep.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.320]   After the seven-way split was--
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.000]   Wow.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.920]   That's after the split.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.000]   So it was a seven-way split.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.960]   So it's right back up.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.080]   I don't know whether it's at or exceeded already
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.760]   the historical high for the value of the stocks.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.360]   That's amazing.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.800]   I don't think we can probably assume
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.320]   it's going to keep on going up until they announce
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.800]   whatever they're going to announce in September,
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   and then it'll go down.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.160]   Their market cap is very close to more than half a trillion,
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.200]   $596 billion.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   They're priced to earning 16 times.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.280]   It's pretty high.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.440]   Not as high as Amazon.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.880]   No, that's actually not too bad.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.200]   Not too bad for a Silicon Valley company.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.440]   So there you go.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.040]   Currently at $100.48, you should have bought it
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.880]   when it was down at 70.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:57.320]   You know, while at the same time, I
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.320]   know I'm not making any money because I don't buy tech stocks.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.280]   There's a certain joy in watching this happen and saying,
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.880]   well, at least I didn't get it on the ground floor.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.040]   Wait a minute, that's wrong.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.680]   At least I'd invite at 12 and 3/8.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.200]   I have my integrity.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.600]   Integrity is intact.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.280]   Friends of mine can play dodge them cars with the four
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.080]   Teslas they bought just because they wanted to.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.840]   But I've got my integrity.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.240]   No one can put a price tag on that, although I asked them
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.280]   to please do so on every given opportunity they have.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.040]   But it is nice to know that at least they
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.440]   have that big stick to fight against.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.080]   Anytime any shareholder says, oh, you shouldn't be investing
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.600]   so much in environmental things.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.320]   And oh, you should--
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.360]   maybe why aren't you making a Chromebook for $250
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.560]   version of the Mac or the iOS?
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.320]   And really all you have to say is, dude, look at how much
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.120]   money we're making for you guys.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.720]   Why are you complaining about anything?
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.640]   Why are you doing nothing but giving us
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.600]   crispy cream donuts by the box load every time we hold a
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:51.960]   meeting?
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.440]   You should be happy.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.320]   Happy.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.440]   Show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.560]   Hey, it is--
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.080]   we are pretty confident that September 9th today that we'll
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.880]   see a new iPhone announced.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.480]   That means this would be a good time to get a price from
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.200]   Gazelle on your old iPhone so you can get some cash for it.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.880]   A lot of people, myself included for a long time, just
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.680]   through the old phone or the old gadget in a drawer
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.440]   and where it collects dust.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.840]   You know, if you open that drawer--
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.640]   I want you to use augmented reality.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.680]   Augmented reality, that means you're looking at the drawer.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.400]   Now, you turn on your augmented reality.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.600]   Those aren't old gadgets sitting there.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.440]   That's a pile of greenbacks just in that drawer.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.200]   And you've been ignoring it.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.920]   Thousands of dollars in that drawer.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.360]   And you're ignoring it.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.920]   Turn those old gadgets into cash.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:45.160]   And by the way, give them a good home at Gazelle.com.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.600]   They normally give you a 30-day lock-in because they know
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.320]   we're going to get a new iPhone.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   They've actually extended it to October 10th.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.200]   So that's almost two months for your iPhone.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.480]   Quote, now why is that good?
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.920]   Well, we don't know, for instance, Apple might announce
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.560]   the September 9th.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.560]   We don't know it'll be available.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.160]   September 19th is typical, but it could be later.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.520]   Plus, you've got to get it.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.960]   You don't want to have to sit and wait in line.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.560]   Maybe you'll get it a few days later.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.760]   You want to put your data on it.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.880]   You want to make sure everything's working.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.600]   It's copacetic.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.560]   And then send the phone back to Gazelle.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.440]   And you still get the price you get quoted today.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.120]   You have till October 10th.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.760]   And that's awesome.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.560]   They buy cell phones from a variety of manufacturers, iPads,
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.320]   iPods, tablets.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.600]   Hey, you want the new Microsoft Surface Pro?
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.440]   I don't know why you would.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.000]   But if you did, you could sell your old one on Gazelle.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.840]   Samsung tablets too.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.280]   They'll buy Apple computers.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.120]   I mean, this is a great source for everybody.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.040]   Just keep bookmark it.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.320]   If you don't have anything to sell, you do, though.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.960]   I bet you do.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.160]   gazel.com.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.720]   You can get check mailed to you if you're in a hurry,
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.320]   get the PayPal, right?
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.040]   Because they'll do that instantly.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.800]   Or get an Amazon gift card for an extra 5%.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.920]   That's a good deal.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.560]   If you buy a lot of stuff at the Amazon--
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.400]   gazels paid out $170 million to over a million customers--
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.480]   their satisfaction rate is higher than almost any company
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.520]   I've ever seen because people just love gazelle.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.160]   And by the way, if your phone's broken, they'll buy it still.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.360]   And if you haven't wiped the data,
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.520]   or you can't because it's broken, they'll
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.680]   wipe the data for you.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.560]   They are a great company.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.360]   I'm very proud to be associated with them.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.560]   And you should keep this in mind.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.040]   Don't let-- just use your augmented reality glasses.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.000]   Look at that drawer and see how it's
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.920]   turning into cold hard cash with gazelle.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.640]   They buy Apple TVs.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.360]   I had a caller on the show, a radio show this weekend,
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.600]   say, I have an Apple 2nd generation.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.320]   Not the current is third.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.000]   Second generation.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.720]   But I'm going to keep it because I can hack it.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.160]   In fact, he said, if you go to eBay
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.320]   with your second generation Apple TV,
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.160]   you can get 300 bucks for it if it's hacked.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.640]   If it's--
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.680]   It's about three times face value.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.200]   No, because it's the last one that you can actually--
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.320]   You can actually jailbreak easily.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:01.800]   Right.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.720]   As a matter of fact, JWZ was actually
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.120]   had a thing on his website saying, I will trade you--
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.160]   I'll trade you a third generation for a second generation.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.600]   You might even say, I will trade you two to one.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.120]   Wow.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.400]   Because what I want my Apple TV to do,
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.320]   the Apple TV 3 cannot do.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.480]   I got to go on my drawer again.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.520]   I know I have a bunch of Apple 2 second--
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.560]   I know, I think I have two or three of them laying around.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.240]   They're suddenly worth something.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.120]   But I got the Fire TV, the Firecore thing.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   It's only 30 bucks and it jailbreaks it.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.760]   So really, you could--
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.640]   I don't know if people are ignorant or what,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:43.440]   but firecore.com, the ATV flash I've used it, it's 30 bucks.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.760]   And then you double the value of your Apple TV
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.320]   and then sell it on eBay.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.280]   [CLICK]
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   Right?
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:54.600]   I don't understand why it's worth so much more jailbroken.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.000]   But anyway, I guess people are buying it
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.160]   because they don't want to take the trouble
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.400]   so that's nice.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.800]   Is really, though, an Apple TV--
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.880]   720p, right?
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.040]   Not 1080.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.560]   Right.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.400]   Even jailbroken.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.880]   It doesn't have a very fast processor in it.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.280]   All of this leading up to the question,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.880]   will Apple announce a new Apple TV this year?
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.400]   I think so.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.120]   I don't think so this year.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.120]   I think I'm--
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.320]   I don't know for sure, but I've been hearing things more
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.640]   about 2015 than 2014.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.720]   Whether or not there's going to be a major update
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.840]   for existing Apple TVs, that's a different story.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   I will--
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   That's surprising.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.840]   That doesn't happen.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.840]   I'm not sure.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.080]   I would have bet money on it eight or nine months ago,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.800]   simply by virtue of the fact that boy is at every do for one.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.400]   I'm not going to be betting money on it this year.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.360]   I wouldn't be surprised that next year we see the 4K.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.360]   You know, 4K.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   Oh, 4K.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.480]   I mean, that's what's missing for-- not missing yet,
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.920]   but is definitely--
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.520]   And one of the reasons is, I think,
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.720]   for a lot of the online solutions.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.400]   So Netflix is already, I think--
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.760]   I don't know if they've already started rolling out,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.760]   but the 4K--
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.760]   The house of cards is 4K.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   Right, so--
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.640]   Well, they're shooting everything in 4K.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.160]   And then you have-- you know, YouTube is already 4K.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   You have--
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.160]   You have a YouTube 4K.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   It's not very good.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   It's not very good.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.760]   But Amazon is probably going to go that direction,
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   and of course, Apple TV.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.480]   And the big thing is, is that it allows these online solutions
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.560]   to be actually higher resolution.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.600]   And it really helps-- it really actually helps the TV manufacturers
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.280]   because they desperately need 4K content to sell 4K TVs.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.000]   And so there's a lot of that back and forth.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.

[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   I think they have to look at the 4K.

[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.500]   that I would like to see happen in a machine that's three years old I'm expected to get
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.520]   five years out of right as really the first in the it's the first to power book to power
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:22.540]   book/mathbook I've had that's had this kind of failure that was not like coke spill oriented
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:27.860]   that so but I haven't seen something like that. My eyes are quite open for this though
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:32.240]   now our chat room up 10 in our chat rooms had it happen beat master's had it happen.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:40.680]   Umm... Uzi Gahlil says my 2011 shuts off randomly from time to time that could be related.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.260]   We have that we have that with our computers now. Umm yeah so I have I have a I have a bug
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:50.000]   that I haven't quite figured out with my with my retina that when it's not plugged in and
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.800]   I plug in a USB and it's below 40% it just turns off. Who got my 2011? Because that's
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:07.420]   because I of course I had one but it's been handed down to an employee by now. I wonder
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:07.620]   who got it. Chad you have a new one. Yeah I don't have it. Umm I'm trying to think there's
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:14.340]   I know of two one. I think this one's this one's 2013 the one I'm using right now. Umm
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:19.860]   and my 2014 went to somebody else I don't know anyway. Somebody's got it. If anybody
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:27.480]   has a problem let me know. Umm and I it is out of warranty but three years is not long
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:32.200]   enough to really especially if this is widespread and in the past Apple has responded to that
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:37.600]   kind of widespread problem out of warranty with replacements and fixes. Yeah they they
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.640]   have a good track record there. I think this this might be a case where it's is the penalty
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:47.340]   for being Apple. They make very very good stuff and people like me keep recommending
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:50.660]   Apple hardware because you're not going to it's not going to die in two years three years
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:54.700]   you can. I keep saying four or five years when I say here's how long you can expect
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:12:00.220]   a MacBook to actually last. And so when something happens to cut that life short it does you
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:04.860]   don't feel like well this probably lasted six months to eight months longer than a Dell
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.900]   laptop of last that you think no come on this supposed to be perfect for the next next
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:16.140]   the next two years at least. Yeah. Now I have a link here that says Apple put a Robin
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:19.980]   Williams tribute up we talked about the fact that that was probably one of Robin Williams
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:26.260]   last works was there what is your verse add but I don't see it anymore so I want it have
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:31.220]   they taken it down. Chad did you see it ever. You know I didn't see it but yeah the link
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:36.860]   redirects just to battle.com. Yeah. Yeah. I saw it on the front page. Maybe it's let's
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:40.740]   go to the front page maybe it's just what will your verse be this is the front page
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:45.500]   and I don't. Yeah. I'm sorry when when the news was still rather fresh. Maybe that's it.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.540]   Maybe that you know after a week they're not going to keep it up there. All right. So
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:54.540]   they did which is good. That's nice. Letterman had a brilliant tribute to what Robin Williams
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.740]   last night because they use they knew each other when they were both like comics at the
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:02.300]   Comedy Store and you just went for 10 minutes personal stories and clips and stuff like
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:09.340]   that. Quite nice. Still I've still kind of it's funny how you take stuff like that personally
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:18.180]   but I'm still kind of reeling from that a week later. It's just it's hard to believe.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:23.620]   A get info rethink is this part of a map not Mavericks. This is this is a completely
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:28.180]   a user created. Oh I'd they always do this. Yeah. Look how nice our get info could be.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:33.140]   I have to admit if you do get info on your Mac you know about this Mac it isn't all that.
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.940]   Well this is a get info on a file on a file. Yeah. If you scroll down there's some kind
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:43.020]   of cool gifts that he made of some of the issues like I you know only Apple gets this
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:48.100]   kind of treatment from its users right there. Well you know as much as I love the old get
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:52.100]   info box look how much nicer it could be. It is kind of funky. Yeah because there's
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:59.060]   info in multiple places that should kind of be next to each other. Oh no this is just
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:04.380]   a lot of designers out there who are just you know just champing at the bit to something
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:08.280]   for Apple. I imagine it's also getting a little bit of a job right. Yeah good.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.020]   And attention. I mean you know we're we're showing on a show. Yeah let's get a little
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:19.940]   yeah. I'm just going through Tom Hanks is I don't know why this is a story. Tom Hanks
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:26.620]   has released a typewriter app for the iPad. It must be the new thing for celebrities to
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:37.260]   do tech stuff. Right. Yeah that's it's interesting. I was he is a big typewriter fan because if
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.420]   you look if you've been listening to him in podcasts it's less that's usually where the
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:43.860]   conversation goes at some point if it goes for more really five minutes. Oh yeah well
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:49.340]   as a matter of fact the the Nerdist got him the got him up for the show because they sent
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:53.780]   him a typewritten invitation to do the show along with a vintage typewriter that was rather
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:15:00.420]   nice. And so he sent back a typewritten acceptance on that same typewriter. Wow. I actually I
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:04.140]   actually reviewed it reviewed it last week and it wound up being like a fifteen hundred
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:08.980]   sixteen hundred word review only because I wrote the review using Hanks writer and I
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:15.180]   was just having so much fun writing with it. So it's my eyes rolled a little bit when I
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:19.740]   saw it too because how many times have you seen these ideas where it's we're gonna have
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:23.340]   word process where it makes typewriter noises when you type okay we've seen that before
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:28.540]   yeah beginning with the beginning with like the you know IBM PC probably. And but they
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.500]   really did a good job of simulating everything and oddly enough the thing one of the things
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:37.940]   I really liked about it was that it's that you get the first it's the first person shooter
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:42.980]   point of view just like in a game where the paper moves from left to right and up to down
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:47.740]   but where the letters appear is always dead center. And as I'm writing writing writing
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:51.820]   for like an hour hour and a half I'm realizing that she isn't it nice not to have to like
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:56.260]   turn my head like to turn my eyes and up and down as I to read what I'm writing as I go
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:01.140]   and it's it's the only thing I don't like about it is that it's no good for exporting
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:06.300]   it only exports PDF files it seems and it'll export it into your Dropbox it'll export it
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:11.540]   into Google Drive or whatever file receiving app you have on your iPad but to turn that
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:15.540]   into a Google Doc that I could then file with my editor I had to use a utility to spit
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:21.260]   out the text and then use BB edit and some reg X Kung food to take out the hard typewriter
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:26.020]   formatting for it. It was just like being in 1987 all over again with having you know
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:31.980]   hard carriage return formatting but it's again I expected that I would like not write
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:35.900]   a review of it or if I did it would be the novelty of oh look Tom Hanks is like contributed
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:39.860]   to an app and it'll be like five or six hundred words but it was like no how do you think
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:45.460]   this worked probably I don't think he wrote it I'm just going on a limb here the the web
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:51.260]   site has the developer website makes it sound as though it was pretty much Tom Hanks saying
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.900]   hey when it be cool if we did this and here's some samples of my typewriters and more of
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:17:03.100]   a console it's well I will think it may be hit sense who wrote it had it and they said
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:06.380]   hey well who should we get to endorse it maybe you could only get Tom Hanks to tweet
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:09.620]   about this we'd sell a million of them as a matter of fact you're reminding me that
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:13.980]   I got an email from them after the review ran if you have any more questions let us know
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:19.260]   so I guess you should say nice guys yeah who I don't think I'll understand this fully unless
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:26.820]   I get to talk to Mr. Hanks make sure I know I do have questions because this is free within
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:31.420]   app purchases what do I get there's the writer's block bundle for five bucks what do I get
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:36.620]   the the in a purchases are in are in essential you can use it as a regular typewriter like
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:42.860]   word processor for free what you can buy are additional models of typewriters that have
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:45.980]   different life faces on them have different designs on them it's kind of you can also
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:51.540]   pay extra for colored ribbon stuff like that but it's not the sort of thing where you can't
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:56.540]   export unless you pay or you can't use the backspace key and unless you pay or the lead
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:18:00.460]   the the the hammers the typewriter jam just like on a real typewriter until you get them
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:05.580]   five bucks that would be funny I did I did say in the review would be nice if just like
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:10.300]   like F1 racing games have normally you it helps you with the steering and the breaking
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:14.420]   and the gear strips but there's an expert mode so that you basically care them off of a bridge
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:18.380]   every time you tap the brakes there should be an expert mode for this that makes it just
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:23.940]   as annoying to use this word processor as it is to use a manual typewriter I actually
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:27.300]   I love to I could see why somebody would collect typewriters if I had the money I'd probably
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:31.940]   do that too it's cheaper than cars it's fun I have a cup I have a couple myself because
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:35.980]   sometimes you're at the MIT flea market there's a really cool one for like ten bucks yeah
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:40.540]   and here in New England we have Cambridge typewriter company like the Nash one of the
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:45.820]   nation's best typewriter repair shops like if you if you there there are authors who
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:50.420]   do nothing but write on typewriters and they are the ones who fix their typewriters it's
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:55.860]   fun but you lose the again the fourth time the keys mash up on you and you have to reach
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:01.180]   in and untwist them and that's realize that yeah nostalgia has its price and right now
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:06.540]   it's about 40 blood pressure points somebody was gonna send me as their old IBM Selectric
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:11.460]   I should have taken those are awesome that you really want I had one and I had to let
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:15.980]   it go and I'm kind of miss it because those the ones there boy it's like it's like it's
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:21.220]   it's like the AK-47 of typewriters where it's you can bash on it you can get it wet you
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:25.700]   can bury it and sand in a burlap sack and come back a year and a half later and dig it up
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:29.340]   and it will still work if you if all the pieces are in the room together you will be able
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.620]   to type with that machine and so come in there is there is something very reassuring about
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:37.220]   making noise while you're writing that at least convinces you that yes I'm actually
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:41.180]   doing work this is I know I'm using the same device that the Kardashian game runs on but
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:47.700]   no I'm actually doing productive for this thing I just okay you're gonna think I'm crazy
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:57.420]   I just bought Lisa does think I'm crazy a bunch of note cards letterpress note cards and they
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:06.940]   sell these on Amazon the Spencerian handwriting guides the copy books so I'm going to relearn
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:15.900]   how to how write a hand write with a fountain pen these are really cool these books fountain
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:19.260]   pen I can give you there's some skill there everything else I could I could I want to have
[01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:26.540]   Spencerian penmanship on my letterpress cards it's I find that it's a it's a meditative it's
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:31.020]   a more meditative way to write when you're writing long hand and I don't I don't do a
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:35.260]   lot of writing that way but there are times one of my one of my stupid little habits is
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.980]   when I'm traveling I have to go to stationary stores and if I find a really cool spiral
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:43.980]   bound notebook like when I was in Japan I must have spent like $50 just on like school
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.580]   student notebooks because they're just so cool in different shapes and sizes and different
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:51.660]   characters on them and sometimes I will take out one of these if I got a writing project
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:55.740]   that can take some time and I want to be in a different sort of frame of mind for it and
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:21:01.020]   it works great but also it's just the idea that not only do I have to compose text a million
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:06.220]   million miles an hour inside my head but there's also the I have to control my hand and my fingers
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:10.700]   and I have to make sure that this is legible and I have to slow myself down because the ink will
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:16.380]   not flow out of the pen as fast as I make scratches on it and before long I'm like nice and calm and
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:22.060]   I'm like in the lotus position it brings back America's golden age of penmanship I wonder if
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:27.340]   there's something sacrilegious about looking for a Spencer a Spencerian penmanship book that's on
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:34.620]   the Kindle no you can't I was like you know what I'm bringing you can look at it and besides
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.820]   you don't want to look at it because the well you could get the you could get the instructional
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:41.820]   book in the kiddell but then there's five copy books you have to write in them no no I know I
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:44.860]   just want the instructional thing on the Kindle I'm like I don't want to carry around a book you
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:51.020]   have to do this over and over again and they have a bundle on Amazon where you get the Spencerian
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:57.260]   penmanship theory book five copy books they're one through five they're all different and then a
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:03.580]   pack of disposable fountain pens the pilot varsity's but really it wouldn't be right to use disposable
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:09.580]   fountain pens on this you need something a little bit better I think I think what you know what you
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:14.860]   need is like a steel ruler on a servo controlled by an Arduino and bluetooth Ellie every time you
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:22.940]   exceed it just goes okay okay that's good maybe that would be kind of melding my two passions
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:28.860]   together like the Tom Hanks typewriter there you go say I'm taking you what I'm taking you one
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:34.540]   step farther forget typewriting I'm gonna hand write the only there is one problem on the lefty
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:39.180]   which means messy it's gonna be beautiful but then it's gonna have big smudge right through
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:46.300]   you have Satan's hand I always had terrible for sure yeah I don't know what I've actually done
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:52.460]   some research on left-handed Spencerian penmanship and there are ways they don't recommend the hook
[01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:59.500]   method new there's a reason why the word the Latin word for left is sinister sinister
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:08.140]   happy belated happy 16th to the Bondi blue iMac was released in May we should have
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:13.580]   we should have had a party I guess we did have a party at the the Flint Center I forgot
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:18.860]   that was for the original Mac though the Bondi blue was released also at the Flint Center
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:25.340]   May 6th 1998 the reason I know that it was five days before tech tv launched on May 11th 1998
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:32.540]   and we had a Bondi blue lovely Bondi blue iMac on the set I got one pretty soon after
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:36.540]   and then we did a collection of other things in Bondi blue turns out it's a very popular the
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:43.020]   translucent Bondi blue plastic very popular we had a vacuum we had I think a dishwasher it was all
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:48.300]   but it was a yeah there was I remember seeing like a George Foreman style grill in every iMac
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:53.340]   cover yes there you go that's influential it's it's it's a big deal when everybody copies the

[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:43.900]   good i think i've bought everything you've picked in the last four weeks including the sous vide
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:50.940]   cooker that you didn't even buy you just said i wish somebody would buy it it's well again well
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:55.820]   i try to be the devil that at least encourages you to do things that are good for you
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:28:00.060]   were you here when you did that because i know you're into sous vide i did i looked at it and i was
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:04.620]   thinking well i already have one but well i'm getting it i bought it i ordered the mellow
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:10.540]   with the comparison i trust yeah i i was i was so keen on that one chiefly because i'm not the sort
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:14.780]   of person who sets the site time at dinner time to do cooking i am exactly the sort of person who
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:19.980]   would have like 20 minutes in the morning to say oh now that i fit now that i i've i've cleaned up
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:24.620]   the the breakfast pans if i can do five minutes of work to make sure that there's a nice pork cut
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:28.780]   that waited for me at six twenty p.m i should do that now because i'm not going to care in about
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:32.860]   two hours from now well though that was cool because it cools keeps it cool and then it heats
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:36.700]   and i have already ordered because this isn't going to come out i don't know for how long like
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:42.140]   till next year but i've already ordered special silicone bags with no PCBs to cook in there you go
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:47.020]   you got the bags did you get the sealer for the bags what you got to seal the bags you don't
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:51.100]   necessarily you don't need it for this one for the one that's coming okay but i i'm serious it's
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:57.500]   it's like you ever a technology comes and a product comes along where now you know exactly how you
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:02.460]   treated other people when you knew about the mac or the iphone and other people didn't it's like
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:06.220]   the tesla and sous vide cookers are just like that because you'll meet someone who
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:11.340]   discovered sous vide cooking a month and a half ago and every conversation has to circle around
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:16.220]   sous vide somewhere i said well no i know that you're not supposed to make burgers and i put oh my god
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.580]   the burgers that are that cooked it was in the bag for 14 hours at at eight degrees and it was the
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:26.700]   most succulent gin i put two sprigs of like okay that's nice well you'll be glad to know thanks to
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:33.100]   your mention they've now sold two hundred thousand dollars worth of these 500 of them so uh they're
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:38.220]   doing they're they're it's it's moving along crowdfunding is where springtime for hitlers
[01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:44.220]   uh financial modal happens several times every single day every day if we can if we can sell
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:48.940]   18 of these will we can scone with the money and do great but oh no we sold now we got what
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:55.020]   pointy million dollar oh oh oh so what do you got for us is what what can i buy this week
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:59.980]   okay this one this one is a little bit less painful it's also kind of a special item um this
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:05.340]   isn't this isn't my pick but this is like for a battery charger to get my attention nowadays
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:08.620]   for someone to send me an email saying hey i got a new battery charger you want me to send me
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:13.100]   son you want to to check out something unusual has to be about it because at this point there's
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:17.660]   so many out there once you find one that you like that's the one you like it's not even necessarily
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:22.620]   because this is the the one that jesus christ himself would own if he hadn't had an iphone this
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:28.540]   is my this happens to be my usual one is by jacary it's called the jacary bar and i like it because
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:34.140]   it's exactly the right capacity for me it's enough so that it can charge a phone two or three times
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:40.220]   and it can also bring an ipad three to about 80 of charge in and of itself and it has really great
[01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:44.460]   power management so that what i really want is kind of like the the sous vide thing i want to be
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:49.740]   able to charge this once drop it in my bag it stays there for a couple of months uh until the one
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:53.340]   or two times when i realize that oh my god i'm out of power i need to charge something up and then
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:56.380]   i'll remember to charge it up again then put it back at the back for another couple months so this
[01:30:56.380 --> 01:31:00.860]   has really good power management that's not too expensive it's about i think twenty five dollars
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:05.260]   thirty dollars so just just as just as a basic frame of reference but the problem is that this is
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:09.660]   like big and it's kind of heavy so that's not something you'd want to carry around in your pocket
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:14.540]   all the time i only have it when i have my uh a laptop bag or my ipad bag so that's why this
[01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:21.020]   caught my attention it's called the travel card and what it is it is the size of a credit card it
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:27.580]   is exactly that thin and it weighs next to nothing and it also is nice enough planned out that it
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:34.540]   also also has a built-in either usb or lightning connector it is made for ipod
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:41.100]   iPhone approved so this is the real thing and so the obvious good news is that if you're
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:45.020]   if you're on a at a meeting or a family event or something like that where you can't have a bag
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:50.140]   slung around your your your your chest all day long this will slip it will fit into a wallet it's
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:54.780]   about the size of maybe four or five credit cards so it might even slip into your wallet if it if
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:59.820]   it doesn't it will slip into again your shirt pocket or your inside coat jacket pocket and not
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:05.100]   take up any room and so for that reason it's unique enough to recommend but it does have a very big
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:11.020]   caveat as you might guess as a super thin and super lightweight charger it doesn't have anywhere
[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:16.140]   near the capacity of something like this so i tested it out yesterday i happened to have an
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:23.980]   absolutely dead iphone uh iphone uh iphone 5s and it charged it up to this one it charged up to 45
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:28.140]   percent at which point this one was absolutely dead so it's not going to be something that's going
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:31.980]   to give you multiple charges or even one charge but it's going to be the sort of thing where
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:36.380]   if you're out all day and you know that around six or seven p.m. you're probably going to be down
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:41.340]   to starvation mode on that phone this will give you those extra three or four hours they'll let you
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:46.300]   get home and still have a working phone throughout the entire workday and like i said it's nice enough
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:49.820]   that and light enough that you don't even you're not even aware that's in there until the moment
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:55.420]   that you need it it's not cheap either it's about 40 dollars i think you have the website open uh so
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:59.820]   yeah 39 bucks yeah but it is unique i haven't seen anything that's quite like this or
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:05.020]   that quite like this that actually works uh and so for that reason that's it's certainly worth
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:11.420]   uh a recommendation yeah lisa went to the niners game on sunday and i gave her a jacory i gave her
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:17.420]   an antec she had like 80 hours worth of battery but it weighs a lot i mean it's having the truth is
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:23.020]   with a road you really needed something to give you emergency juice uh you know and so half a charge
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:27.900]   for something this small that's not bad yeah exactly travel card and it looks like they're doing a
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:31.740]   crowd funding kind of a thing yeah that well it was originally launched as a kickstarter
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:35.900]   thing or some sort of a cloud crowdsource thing now it's an actual commercial thing got it uh that's
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:39.820]   why they sent it to me i think because now it's actually shipping see it's got the ce logo and a
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:46.860]   new thing it's real it's legal it's legal baby travel card charger dot com Alex Lindsay
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:50.620]   you see you have famous i was already looking at Amazon i was like great
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:56.620]   card power this is a great idea so so anyway you know i i app really apples created this market
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:00.780]   because they don't have removable battery you have to have your mophie case or because you can't get
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:05.340]   through a day and then i'm afraid yeah i have lots of i have powers i have the power gens i have
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:09.660]   like i have a ton of them and the other thing though i do do what i'm traveling a lot is i take my
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:14.380]   my fi and i take these batteries and i just hook one of the batteries to the my fi and throw at my
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:18.540]   backpack and then i have my own little personal wi-fi anywhere i go i don't have to think about oh i
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:22.700]   don't keep it going just keeps it in my backpack and whatever and it just runs all day you know so
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:30.220]   you don't have to think about it i bought a solar charged goal zero makes a solar charger uh for
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:35.580]   batteries so but i don't i haven't yet used that much time in the sun i don't even see when you look
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:42.460]   at the video completely useless yeah exactly for me because uh yeah yeah i thought it'd be useful if
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:50.140]   i ever went outside what do you got so i spent the weekend in Tucson, Arizona there's lots of sun there
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:53.900]   there was it was actually a lot of rain and lightning it was rainy season but there was
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:58.300]   some sun there too it was obviously it's Tucson, Arizona my uncle actually the uncle that i talked
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:03.660]   to that i talked about on triangulation my my mentor yeah um so he was uh it was the 70th birthday
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:09.100]   three finger Lindsey no no that's not that's the other uncle yeah yeah okay um you know he so he
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:13.500]   it was the 70th birthday so we we came from all over the country and uh this is a big family and
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:20.300]   that's great and um we're known for uh plain poker um and i didn't lose all of my money i lost just a
[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:24.220]   little that's fun it just spent like the whole weekend playing poker we only spent one night we
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:28.540]   started about it's nine i think and i think we finished by like two o'clock in the morning 2 30 in the
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:34.140]   morning and um and usually i mean they've got to get some of the people in my family are near pro yeah
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:39.260]   i'm sure and so i thought you might be no i had well i played a lot of poker but i hadn't played
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:44.940]   Texas hold them i played a once in Vegas and lost everything within like 15 minutes and um so i had
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:48.700]   to kind of learn how to do that and it was very you know i i survived you know the guys didn't you
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:54.620]   know a lot of guys got cleaned out um and uh but i uh no limit um there was no limit but we weren't you
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:58.700]   know it was like one dollar five dollar ten dollar wasn't easy to destroy a game like that but just
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:03.100]   going all in on every hand yeah there were a couple guys were but like someone would come to the
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:07.900]   table and they're like okay now because we were going you know it's you know the um the big blind
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:13.660]   was like a dollar so it's not like it's easy and everything else and so um but the uh uh
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:19.820]   anyway so um still just had to get around the odds and everything else and so i asked my uncle
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:24.780]   who plays a lot of poker i mean this is like you know what he he won a lot of money that night and uh
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:30.940]   i said so if i want to learn how to play Texas hold him which app like it was actually a website
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:35.020]   he plays websites and i said which is the best one and he so so i decided that would be my pick
[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:40.460]   it's poker stars dot net that's the one they advertise on world poker tour baby they advertise
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:46.380]   it but he said that is the from a um from a real poker player he said that is the that's the one you
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:50.860]   want to go in you're gonna get the best you're gonna get the most accurate odds any money no you
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:55.820]   were your buying points you're or something i don't know yeah and so um but you're not yes none of these
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:37:01.660]   are it's illegal they've made this illegal not illegal but they've made it illegal if there's
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:05.100]   real money so that's the good news you can't lose money on this right so he's got a whole bunch
[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:08.860]   of points but he said that there's real poker players up there playing there there's good odds
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:14.780]   you're really getting a sense of of how of what you're uh how do they make money um i still think
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:18.140]   you're buying points it's kind of like you're buying points that you're winning and losing but
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:23.180]   it's really yeah you're getting a lot of how is that not gambling what wait a minute you're trading in
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:27.660]   american and playing a game points you're buying points and then and playing a game i don't think
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:31.820]   you can really make any other you can look at the they're really got a skirt in the law there all right
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:36.780]   well i anyway so i just started playing but if you don't have to buy points no i think you do have to
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:41.820]   buy points to play so but but i but i don't know i bought points so i don't know if i need it or not
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:46.060]   but now you're like a killer no i just started i just but it's really cool and i thought i would you
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:51.820]   know share the wisdom from uh someone who not from me but from someone who actually knows which one to
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:56.700]   get so if you're wondering and now i'm going to become you know i've decided to stop playing field
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:01.980]   runners you know you ought to learn something a skill here's the worst part learn a skill that
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.740]   can make you a living exactly my wife makes a lot of fun because i it's not that i now that i play
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:09.500]   field runners so often i i actually if you don't really make them want to like get two million points
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:13.100]   yeah so i could play the same map living doing field runners should be great and i would
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:17.500]   you clean up i would i would make some serious money if i could what do you have like Alex Lindsey's
[01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:20.780]   field runner lessons i've been actually thinking about we should do a field runners tournament
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:27.340]   i don't know if people email enough people we'll we'll do it right here we'll build like a whole
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:32.300]   little set and we'll do a field runners tournament and i'll put down thousand dollars for the grand
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:37.260]   prize you can't play head to head though so you could you can you know i mean you could you can
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.220]   so the thing is is the math is the same you could have two people playing at the same time at the same
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:44.940]   time the same level it does exactly the same thing but you're not allowed to use let's let's do
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:49.260]   that so new game okay field runners tournament we'll start thinking about it and figure out when
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:54.860]   it dies the world field runners hey people play a lot that people spend a lot of time watching other
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:59.580]   people play games i know just put them head to head and we can do like right is there a field
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:04.700]   runners three coming out yeah hopefully hopefully i'm not i'm done with those maps i need new ones okay
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:12.700]   all right anyway so that's it so poker stars i got it i met my new game yay Alex Lindsey my pick
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:20.940]   of the week i finally got it back what do you think that is i am so confused it's got it
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:27.820]   this has nothing to do with apple in any respect uh it is it's cool looking it's cool this is i did
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:34.780]   a review of this for before you buy and i raved about it and uh and i and i guess i got one which is
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:40.780]   nice so i'm completely corrupted so you shouldn't trust my review of this this you don't like this

[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:17.820]   he writes for the chicago sun times you can see his 15,000 word article on tom hanks typewriter
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:25.740]   sometime soon and uh everything else oh you know what people have been really excited about your
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:30.860]   pictures from boston comic con and those are up on flicker flicker.com/andiei
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:35.660]   i've seen some nice shots really nice shots that's it that's that's another
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:42.300]   in terms of pics of the week that really i'm i would marry and make it mrs olympus omd em one
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:47.500]   and not go that's that's probably the one that's happy with his new camera that was the last thing
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:52.380]   the last kind of picture that i take often that i didn't get to take yet with that camera was this
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:57.180]   and oh man it's like i've been taking pictures of con since like 2001 and that was the first time i
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:04.620]   could say the reason why some of my pictures suck is because i'm incompetent awesome well it was
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:10.300]   crowd big crowd that day oh that's that's why that's why i volunteered to be a speaker because
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:13.740]   you get to get in there in our early weather still inter conditioning and no crowds yet
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:20.540]   oh look she's she's painting her spider girl outfit get ready jacket just a jacket this is fun
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:28.940]   cosplay is not consent yeah well is it new a new poll there's a lot that's good yeah because
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:34.300]   there it harassment at cons has been a big problem because a lot of people who are addressing costume
[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:37.500]   some of them are you know they're super hero costumes so they're a little bit racy and some
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:40.700]   people think oh well you know because they're showing some skin it's okay for me to take pictures
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:45.180]   that from any angle and to be a big creep about it right and so just to have those signs all over
[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:49.980]   the place just to reinforce that look just because someone is wearing a costume does not mean that
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:57.180]   they you should treat them like some of the they're not dolls it creates it creates a trying to foster
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:45:02.860]   a greater environment of respect for everybody who is there and fortunately there are a lot of
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:06.300]   people I heard from a different couple of different cosplayers about the X I also wrote a
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:10.220]   feature for Boeing Boeing on the first day of the con about these new kind of policies and they're
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:13.980]   saying boy boy was that did that work out great for us because we just felt a lot better there so
[01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:17.660]   they had problems in San Diego didn't they they have problems everywhere again they're
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:22.940]   it's amazing that there are people who would not treat a woman that way if they were inside a mall
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:27.020]   or anywhere else because they know that they'd be thrown to the ground arrested and taken to jail
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:30.300]   but they feel as though well I'm at a comic con it's not the same thing if I want to
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:35.100]   grope a woman or if I wanted to otherwise treat her with this respect that's perfectly fine because
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:38.780]   the big thing is that they're going to throw me out of the con and we have to convince them that
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:42.780]   know what happens is that again we have cops there we will hold you and we will have you arrested
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:47.820]   because you should be committed to crime anyway I love this Batman winning a bingo picture
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:50.380]   the Joker howling
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:57.420]   it's again it's such a festival and I'm sorry this isn't supposed to be comic-con week
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:02.460]   breakly but break weekly but that's that's one of the great things about modern cons because if
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:05.980]   you're not if you have never been to a modern comic con you might think that oh this is for nerds
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:09.980]   and Star Trek costumes and you have to dress like a Klingon and be really interested in hearing
[01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:14.700]   what William Shatner has to say but really it is like what any sort of like big public festival
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:21.980]   where does it take this guy to dress up oh that's that he's great I see him like every year in a
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:26.940]   different costume oh okay last year he was last year he was in a Jedi costume the year before that
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:33.820]   he was in like the rebooted Tron version of Tron costume and this is one of the crewmen
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:40.780]   on the bridge where the deck office deck officer in the in the ad bar act bars and that's that's
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:45.900]   no no no he's definitely definitely of the empire oh i'm sad that it's it's the cool thing about like
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:49.980]   I said i've been taking pictures of cons for like 10 or 15 years and it takes it sometimes it takes
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.700]   three or four or five years to realize that there is a woman that i take a picture of every single
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:59.020]   year without realizing i've taken her picture every single year this year i finally like she
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:04.220]   i this year i finally like knew she knew what her name was and she actually had a table because she
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:10.700]   she was she she is spice girl oh this is Bob's burgers Bob's burgers she's like that i love it
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:16.220]   that's exactly that's exactly the reason why i love these cons you'll see families dressed up
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:20.860]   like that and they're have they're all having the greatest time in the whole damn world it's amazing
