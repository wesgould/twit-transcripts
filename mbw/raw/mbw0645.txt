[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.900]   Here's Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.900]   Hello. Hello.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.900]   Star of pixel core.com.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.400]   Great to see you in studio.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.200]   Good beer.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.000]   Annie Enocho from WGBH Boston, Boston public radio and the newly revised in not co calm database working.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.800]   Thank you.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.900]   And all the way from Montreal, Mr Renee Richie, where he's freezing cold.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.200]   Fortunately, Apple's putting a beach up for you on your Apple TV.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   Yeah, it's so considerate of them just to show me what I don't have to name.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.000]   I guess we should start with Tim Cook's editorial in Time magazine.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.900]   Yeah, you deserve privacy online.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.100]   So smart of Apple to double down on privacy.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.100]   This is there at this point to the last man standing.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.000]   Right.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.600]   I mean, Google, Facebook, Amazon, even Microsoft, none of them respect your privacy.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.400]   Obviously.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.600]   And they would be different.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.400]   I disagree with that.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.300]   Okay, good.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.000]   I want a little disagreement.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.300]   So they respect Andy's privacy.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.700]   Let me let me read what Tim said in Time magazine this week.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.000]   He says 2019.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.200]   It's time to stand up for your right to privacy.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.800]   Yours mind.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.500]   All of ours consumers shouldn't have to tolerate another year of companies irresponsibly amassing huge user profiles.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.800]   Data breaches that seem out of control and they've I should read it like he would and the vanishing ability to control our own digital lives.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.700]   Good morning.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.000]   Good morning.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.700]   Also, yes, make sure to include the applause breaks.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.800]   He's calling for Congress to pass comprehensive federal privacy legislation and he has four points.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.500]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:32.300]   He says the right to have personal data minimized the right to know what data is being collected on you and why the right to accessing your data to correct it or delete it.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.800]   And the right to data security without which trust is impossible.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.200]   Those all seem reasonable and then kind of actually seems like what GDPR does in Europe.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:51.200]   Also, there's the UK has the UK has a top level government bureau that has exactly the same principles to the issue is of course.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:12.400]   So does California, but there, you know, I think companies like Apple would prefer it be a national federal law rather than 50 individual state laws and you think in there too, which is super interesting, which he didn't have last time and that he believes there should be a data broker clearing house so that you know, not only who collected your data, but who they've sold it to or given.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.000]   It to or shared it with or partnered with or been murdered an acquisition with down the chain.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.400]   So that if you do decide you trust Google, you give it to Google.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   If Google shares other people, you have the right to know who all those other people are or if your local ISP decides they're going to share data.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.300]   You should always be able to go to a national clearing house and see the sort of path of the blood trail of your data, so to speak.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.900]   They he says the FTC should be in charge of that.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.400]   I this all seems like a sensible thing Andy.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.700]   What what is so you don't think that Apple is I don't know what do you think?
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.600]   I'm not sure what you know.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.400]   I was I was just reacting to the comment that the Apple is the only company that respects privacy.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:07.900]   Google, I think has a has a basic fundamental respect for privacy, but that's within and security, but that's within the within the Bailey WIC of their ability to make money from user data.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:17.700]   However, given that they don't it's not even into their economic interest to let any other company have access to your data as opposed to that.
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.400]   Sorry.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.500]   Three coaks today, not just way way too many coaks today.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.000]   I love it.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.500]   Basically that Google doesn't sell personal information.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   They sell access to people because they're that's the that's a really important asset to them.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.000]   Not only to not only do I think that same thing with Facebook and he and not only Facebook didn't mind selling it to the third.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.700]   No, no, no, Facebook and Google are way way different.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:56.600]   Facebook is such a deep level of hell that we have not been able to create a probe that could survive the heat and pressure to send it down there to see what with the with the core of Facebook's moral center is.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:07.600]   I mean, even like I've been looking at someone had a 15 minute video on YouTube about the next version of the next version of Android and it seems to be very much a privacy focused update.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   Also internally when I talked to I've you know, we all talked to people internally and unofficially at Facebook and Google and at Apple and Facebook.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.100]   They just don't seem to understand that this is an important thing.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.000]   It's an important thing for PR purposes, but otherwise no Google everyone time I talked to people there.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:45.700]   They are very, very concerned with there's that when there's any sort of a compromise of security, as a matter of fact, they shut down the whole excuse me the dragonfly project about creating a Chinese Chinese search engine was definitely definitely taken back to square one because an internal group said, hey, look, you're using data in a way that you should you have to go through us first.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:54.800]   The privacy board to figure out if you're using this data. Okay, because you didn't go through us. Guess what? You don't get access to any that data anymore. You have to throw out and start start over again.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:06.200]   So I'm saying that I don't think that I don't think you can say that Apple's the only one that's interested in this. However, Apple is in the best position to champion this because they don't have really any financial stake in user data.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:25.700]   And what Tim has talked about is something that's very that has been done very, very well in the UK and the EU and it needs to be federal law and all these companies are kind of interested in being a federal law because they feel as though they can lobby one set of legislators a lot more effectively than they can lobby 50 cents of legislators.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.500]   So I've had the chance to talk to.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.900]   I've had a chance to talk to a lot of the people inside and it's very interesting because they all have their different perspectives.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:43.900]   When you talk to Apple security team, they don't want anyone to have your data. They don't want Apple to have it if they can possibly do it. They just want you to have your data and they'll try to do stuff with it as best as they can for you. But really, they have no interest in your data.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.400]   We talked to Google.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   They're like Facebook and the NSA are the enemy. You can trust us. We're fine. But Facebook and the NSA are the absolute devil. And now with with like, I saw the video and XDA as well and they're going to do a lot of stuff with Android Q, but it's still outward facing stuff is tough to prevent your privacy from others.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:16.000]   And Google, I think still has never had that moment of reflection about what they allow to be collected internally because that you're right. That group shut down. What was happening with Google, but until they shut it down, nobody at Google cared that they were doing all it wasn't like they were they had access to this information and someone had to go in and shut it down.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.100]   It wasn't like they had to go and apply for this information.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.500]   It's still a very free book culture within there.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.500]   And I don't think they respected it.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.500]   I think they're wise to know that people will get super angry when they don't and they'll react to it when they do.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:37.100]   But there's still no culture of we need to go and ask permission before we do this. And Facebook, exactly what Andy said, is sort of like we're connecting the world and don't bother us with the details of what we do.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.400]   I disagree.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:48.500]   The I think that the situation with Dragonfly was a special situation because they're not talking about data that Google was collecting on its own users.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.200]   I think the one of the reasons why it was it was able to happen was because this is a come.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:21.200]   It was a Chinese Internet sort of homepage like launch page that Google had bought a while ago and it was easier for the for the team that was developing the search engine to get access to that data because it was kind of on the periphery of what Google is collecting and not so all I'm I just agree, but only because the conversations I've had with people inside Google is not in sync with what the conversations apparently that you've had these people.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.200]   And as we always every time we talk about this, there's always again that that flip side of things.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   I have that for instance, if you I say often that Google the best Google features are right at that balance point between incredibly cool and incredibly creepy.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:48.500]   So like if you're using if you're using Gmail as your as your main inbox, you suddenly get a reminder to say, Oh, remember how you signed up for newspapers.com for that 30 day free trial.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:56.100]   Well, that was 28 days ago. And if you don't cancel it in the next two days, they're going to charge you $120 for the one year subscription.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:04.700]   And at one point you say, wait a minute, Google Google has been like mine looking through my emails for actually I'm very I totally forgot about that.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:11.000]   Thank you for saving me $120 Google tap, tap, tap, tap, but hey, you shouldn't have been looking at my day that way.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:26.500]   So it's a it's a trade off like there are a lot of there's arguments to be made that a lot of Apple products aren't as good as competing products because they're even unwilling to take data willingly from people if they were to ask if they were to ask people.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.600]   Hey, here's if you allow us to do this to get to take a look at this and retain this data.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.200]   Here's how we could make this product better for you.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.700]   And that might be if like a limiting factor for how well they can develop their products services.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:51.000]   Well, I think that I think that Apple has the advantage here and will always have the advantage because they're not making money on your data, you know, and they're just always going to be able to play this game much harder than everyone else.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:07.100]   You know, they're they are because they're and they're not going to and as we move into Internet of things, I think people are going to become more and more sensitive to the fact that rings sent video to the Ukraine and and Amazon accidentally accidentally sent a bunch of records to other people.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:22.800]   Yes, you know, like, you know, so the thing is is that and I think the mistake Apple's made with Internet of things, for instance, is not releasing more hardware, you know, not doing their own bits and pieces here and making sure that they kind of go in the opposite direction because they would they used to require that chip and now they just do so.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.700]   And I think that's a mistake.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:34.800]   I think that Apple Apple should Apple should be should triple down on it and look at these four points and and grade Apple on these four points and other companies to the right to have personal data minimized.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.900]   Now that you have to trust the company to do that.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:44.000]   Cook says, company should really be thinking, you know, do I need to collect all this data that I'm collecting?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.700]   And actually, this is the point in surveillance capitalism where Shoshana Zobo says Google collected it just by accident was data exhaust and then realized its value later.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:59.300]   Apple does Apple you think I think Apple probably does do this and trust the technologies.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.800]   I mean, like I said, I never trust the company, but I trust the technologies and they're using AES encryption.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   If they're using differential privacy and you can go through the chain and they publish those white papers,
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.600]   but we don't hack to their systems enough to see.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.400]   We don't really.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   I mean, you can't know with any company, maybe more with Apple than others, but you can't know with any company how much they're collecting and whether they're really minimizing and anonymizing and how effective their anonymization is and all that stuff.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.900]   But I think we can say Apple's probably doing this.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.000]   Why wouldn't they?
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.200]   Right?
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.800]   There's no incentive for them to do otherwise.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.600]   And once you speak the way you do, if you're caught not doing it, then it's a world of hurt for you.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.900]   How about, and of course, Google is probably collecting everything they can.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.700]   We know Facebook's collecting everything they can.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.900]   We know Amazon's collecting everything they can.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.100]   Right.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:51.100]   What Zobo says is, you know, I didn't know this, but there was when Larry and Sergey presented PageRank in 1998 to a web conference.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:58.700]   Larry said, and of course, you can't take advertising or sell advertising against this data because it would no matter what, even if you didn't want to see it.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.400]   And you can't even want it to compromise the quality of your search that search has to be.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:09.500]   He said this explicitly what I've said for a long time, which is search kind of has to be agnostic.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.600]   It has to be pure.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   It has to be pure.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:21.900]   And as Zobo says, what happened was they basically invented surveillance capitalism after the dot-com bust because their investors came to them and said, guys, you got to monetize now.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:27.600]   And they said, Oh, well, look, we accidentally have all this data from our users.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.700]   Let's use this.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.800]   And they and they turned around.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.700]   So we know we know Google's doing it and discovered it.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:39.800]   This is the fear, though, is maybe companies are accidentally gathering this and haven't yet seen the value of it.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:46.600]   And then down the road, they go, Oh, look at this trove of data or they get bought by a company or they get bought or the government comes to that.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.800]   Or what happens is it's not the it's not the any vertical of data that's being gathered.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.200]   It is the combination of all of them that gives someone a crystal clear vision of us, even across companies.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:04.800]   Yeah. Well, and Facebook not only gathers a lot of data from their users, but they buy a lot of data, you know, to build that.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:19.000]   And frankly, so does Google because and we know Google does this because they've offered their advertisers the information about when a user goes into a brick and mortar store and buy something with a credit card.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.600]   Look, that was from your ad.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:36.100]   So that they're buying credit card purchase and to your previous point, we've seen them use Google results when other companies results are better at the top of their search because they want to promote their own version of that business and they because before it was all, but it has to be the best result will do anything, the best result.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.900]   But over time that gets compromised because you're like, well, we can't build our business that we don't give more people to it.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.900]   So we'll just push this.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.400]   But here's a data point.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   Here's a data point and that data point is nine billion dollars, which is what Google pays Apple or paid Apple last year.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.700]   For all of the data from Safari searches.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:00.200]   The biggest hole with all four of these is that is the Google search inside of the iPhone.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.400]   Yeah, or the minute you put a Facebook app on the iPhone.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.400]   So what Apple doesn't control is what other people are doing with their hardware.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.300]   They may not be collecting it, but it's a little bit hands up.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:18.200]   If Google gave us nine billion dollars and supposedly 12 billion dollars this year, that's not what I think.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:24.300]   You can make an argument that an adult should be allowed or like anybody should be allowed to install a Facebook app or a Google app if they want.
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:24.800]   That's right.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.500]   But the search thing is the one that's bothersome.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.000]   No choice.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.300]   No box that flashes up and says, do you want Google to be your default search engine or if Apple really believes this, which ones do you want to give us?
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.500]   Give us a duck duck go option, right?
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.700]   Yeah, or at least give us that browser roulette thing that they did in the EU, which lets you choose.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:47.500]   Second, the right to knowledge and I like this to know what data is being collected and why how forthright is Apple about that.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.300]   Do they tell us?
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.000]   We know Google does, by the way, Google's dashboard is very good in this regard.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.800]   Apple has a download.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   You download a big binary blob and it has things like you made an iTunes purchase on January.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.800]   That's only so cheap in PR though, right?
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.200]   That's new.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.300]   Yeah, that's because they were required to do it.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.100]   And because they never collected enough to actually never did it internally.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.900]   They had no interest in it.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.000]   If you look down on the structure for what their.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.200]   Yeah, it wasn't.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.300]   It looks like when you downloaded it is not very much stuff because they don't want it.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.400]   Like Apple specifically doesn't want to they don't want to be accountable for it.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.100]   That's the first one.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.000]   Minimize, right?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:30.600]   And they just first point and Apple's trying to they're trying to burn all the bridges behind them as they, you know, because they're because they're trying to get into a situation where like if you look at this fight, which I still think is going to be a big deal from Australia.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:38.400]   Is Apple's trying to basically cut off, you know, break everything so that it would take a long time and be really hard to even get back to getting your data?
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.700]   You know, you know, they're they're going as far the opposite direction of the search companies is in social companies as you can.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:50.400]   Third point, the right to access and that's that download that Apple offers Google offers the same thing.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.800]   I don't know how complete it is.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.400]   Facebook now does too.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   I think that's GDPR requiring it.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.200]   So it's not like they had any choice.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:05.300]   So everybody now thanks to G and this is why a national law would be a good thing because companies aren't going to do it until they're mad and they have to do it.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:05.500]   Right.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.500]   And finally, the right to date is security and this is a real problem.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.900]   I Apple has been breached.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.900]   Google to my knowledge has never been breached.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   Facebook will give it away.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.300]   They don't care about it.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.700]   I don't think Apple's userland like user data has been the app has been breached.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.600]   I don't know.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.700]   No, no, iCloud.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   Remember those.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.000]   That wasn't breached.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.900]   Those were fished.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.300]   Okay.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.500]   Breach security is the point.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:37.300]   If if you could fish Apple, get Scarlett Johansson's nude pictures.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.900]   Well, that's not data security.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.500]   There was some Gmail and they were there was a whole bunch of different accounts and there was there was a lot of Apple, but there was some.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.000]   Yahoo.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.600]   There was some G.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   I was just pointing out.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.700]   Yeah, not totally.
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:51.200]   But that also that also points out how important just to get the language of this sort of legislation.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.700]   Correct.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.200]   You can't have a government or a civil suit claiming that.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.400]   Well, I know that I know that that Mr.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.700]   Hanson had a password of one, two, three, four, five, six and maybe it's her fault.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.000]   But hey, Apple should have made sure that she couldn't use a password like one, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.600]   They should have made her change her password every single week.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.400]   That's the kind of mess that can happen if we over legislate this.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.200]   But you have to you do have to go back pretty far to find a case of Apple being kind of irresponsible.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:18.900]   That sort of stuff.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.000]   Remember where they're doing it.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.100]   Quote accidentally, I'm quote left a testing mode and enabled with what was it?
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.700]   I don't know if it was Google map.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.100]   Excuse me.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:38.000]   If it was Apple Maps or if it was just for their their Wi-Fi app, but basically they left sort of breadcrumb of trails of locations of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers they connected to.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:47.600]   And that was in a place where a sufficiently as efficiently enabled hacker could go get that data and get a recent map of places where people have been.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.400]   But that was what five years ago, six years ago.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.500]   And it seems as though whoever needed their ass kicked on that one got their butt kicked.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.100]   It's hard to do and I would not blame any company for a mistake.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.400]   And as long as that company shows that they are clearly working on it.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.900]   But that's made it I think it's one of the most important parts of this entire that's this entire letter right now.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:27.000]   There is are absolutely no no repercussions if you are irresponsible to the to the to the extent of carelessness with user data like I'm keeping your social security numbers and credit card numbers in plain text on Amazon on Amazon server where anybody could just find it and get it.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.300]   And all you got to do is say oops.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.300]   Oh, here's a five dollar gift card.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.600]   We're so sorry.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.200]   And and how are you going to make restitution?
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:36.900]   Well, we don't have to.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:45.100]   So we're not going to and really this like with the just like when you see all these companies are creating new protections because they have to comply with the law.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:52.600]   Once you put money on the table and saying here's how much money you're going to be liable for the next time that you leave something in plain text where people can find it.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.200]   That's when you start they start thinking about how can we encrypt these things?
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.800]   How can we actually take good care of data?
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:09.300]   We've had these laws for medical data and it works very, very, very well and it would not have happened if we if they were not laws with real penalties for abusing patients medical data.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:14.800]   And I think that Apple this opens up an opportunity for Apple which is that you know already they're moving in there.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.400]   They're moving heavily into the health care industry and they're going to continue to go down that path.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:28.200]   I still think that they have a lot of opportunities to move into the banking industry and then home, you know home automation and all three of those things people are super sensitive about their.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.400]   Their privacy related to those things and I think that Apple is better positioned than anyone else to take advantage of that.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:48.000]   Google is paying the first big GDPR fine, 50 million euros to the French data regulator for quote lack of transparency inadequate information and lack of valid consent regarding ad personalization.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.100]   People weren't informed about how Google collected data to personalize advertising.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.600]   I don't know if that's a and we'll debate this I'm sure tomorrow on twig.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:02.000]   But I don't know if that's a fair fine but it's a hefty enough fine to get people's attention that's for sure.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.400]   It's definitely an indication of a user oriented piece of legislation that's not designed to mitigate liability to corporations.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:20.600]   It's designed to basically make life difficult for a company like Google who then has to defend themselves even if the penalty is out of scale with what the transgression was or if there was even a transgression.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:30.800]   But I think that's exactly where it should be. I really don't have the ability to sue Google once they decided to put my entire browsing history online for anybody to see.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   Whereas Google has to wear with all to defend themselves from a government action or FTC action saying you owe us 50 million dollars for being irresponsible with anti-anautica browser history.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   I think the only other the only downside of this is for I was talking to somebody that was the developer in Europe and they said the real challenges for little companies.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:56.800]   You said big companies like Google can afford to pay these these fines no matter how big they are but little companies are now terrified of data collection at all.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   You know like any new business idea that might include data collection.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.000]   That's why a lot of them they don't.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Little paper said to European readers you can't read our can't read the LA Times.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:07.600]   You can't read.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   Right and we look at the new news.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   That's law right.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.600]   That fortunately looks like that's.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   Oh no it was article 13 and 14 are going to go down it looks like but.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   Yeah but I think link tax was part of 13 wasn't it.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.600]   Yeah I think so so I think that that looks like that's not going to happen.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   But the irony is the big headlines say you know many.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   I had something that some number of European states didn't support 13 and 14 so it probably won't pass.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.600]   But in most cases they didn't support because it didn't go far enough.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   I know it's horrible.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   It wasn't that it was a terrible idea which it was.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   It didn't go far enough.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   Was it terrible enough.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   So this is the problem is that and this is where people get very nervous when you talk about government regulation of the Internet.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   This kind of thing yeah we want privacy and security but at the same time you can also get make a law that's a terrible law.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   Absolutely.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:04.600]   Yeah Alex made a really good point there recently we saw a maybe good intention or just maybe facetiously applied American law that says we need to protect.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   People from sex trafficking and so because a lot of that.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   Exactly because a lot of the business being done on the Internet we're going to say that you are liable if people are using your site your site or service for the purposes of sex trafficking.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   Which is okay but it's broadly enough that means that now if you are as if you are a smaller sort of site or smaller host.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   All the message boards that you've got that allow Frank discussion of sex work and also our support pages for people who are in that kind of work that use as a community resource to keep themselves safe and keep themselves healthy.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:53.600]   Now those are being pulled down because these smaller companies cannot possibly afford to deal with either a government lawsuit government shutdown or a civil suit that might come as a result of this legislation.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.600]   So it's it's really important that we start these talks.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   Apple is doing a really good job here by saying by saying we're essentially we're in a position where we can championship this on principle because it for whatever reason.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   So we are going to make this part of the ongoing conversation we're going to use our power to put pressure on other companies to try to support this kind of stuff too.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:31.600]   And it's also easy to come up with a four point bill of rights. I've always said that I think that the the most important article in a digital bill of rights is that your personal data belongs to you and you can license it to other people but it still belongs to you
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.600]   and you can we can revoke that license at any time.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   However implementing that in such a way that it allows Google to implement really really good features that I like for Google Maps without having to make me opt through every single time that I want to find out.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   A is the post office near me open right now.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:57.600]   That's going to be bad. And as it means that the next startup that has a really good idea for a mapping app can't even get off the ground because of liability.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.600]   That's also bad. So we need to move forward.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   And we're going to suffer some mistakes but we have to make sure that we don't just get out of our heads on this.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.600]   Well and one of the things that Apple Apple's actually still better positioned for most of this.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   They could actually provide a service to startups or even brands where you basically have a privacy layer that Apple knows who the people are on one side.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   The brand knows nothing about them other than what they divulge to the brand.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   And the brand could actually literally build a social network around them. Not a social network like Facebook but like a following or this could be a brand or an individual.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   But it all goes through this privacy layer that kind of like Apple pay except for social.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:46.600]   And the brands could because the brands are all antsy to get off these networks for a variety of reasons.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:56.600]   When the social networks are constantly changing the rules about how you can interact with their platform it makes the brands crazy because they make plans for years or a year at least.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.600]   And now the rules that we're working last year aren't working this year.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.600]   So they're all antsy to go somewhere. Apple could provide them with that.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.600]   It would be an Apple Twitter.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.600]   Well not an Apple. It wouldn't be a centralised one.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   Think of it more of a...
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.600]   I would sign up for an Apple Instagram.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   Right. So the idea though is that the data people could come to, they could come to let's say virtual events or other things like that or be interacting but you as a brand or as a company don't necessarily know who they are beyond what they said.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.600]   But they are who they... It is a stable relationship.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.600]   You know who you're talking to the same person you talked to before.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.600]   It's just that it's randomised in a way that you can identify it.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.600]   It would be interesting.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.600]   What a good business for Apple if they did that.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.600]   It would be a big business.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.600]   This is why they really need to double down on this.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   There's no reason for that in any way to hold back because there is a huge opportunity since there seemed to be the only company that cares the least about this.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   It would probably work better if it worked the same way the banking industry worked where no one person holds the truth and no one private organization holds the truth or holds the ability to sort of police the whole thing.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:17.600]   Because remember that Apple could be in the same place that Blackberry or Nokia were at in ten years time and then when we're at now it's a company that simply has all these assets.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   And if they are also in charge of controlling this thing they are also...
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.600]   That's the fear.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   So that's why it's...
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   Let's take some of the budget away from the border wall security in the TSA and create like a federal clearing house, a federal, federal custom house for consumer data.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   But then there's the fear that that's going to go to intelligence agencies that they'll have free access to that.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600]   That's true.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   This is why this is a very intransigent problem.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.600]   It's a hard problem to solve.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:54.600]   Well, we have DNS records that are not owned by one country, one government, one company and it seems to work.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.600]   It can be hacked and there can be flaws but we can make it work.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:04.600]   So if we have a non-centralized, distributed and encrypted system for this sort of thing where basically this is...
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   Well, that's blockchain.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.600]   There you go.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   Store your data in blockchain.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   It's decentralized, it's encrypted.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   No one...
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.600]   Nobody controls it.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   Like ourselves.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.600]   At point.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   As long as we're talking security, Tim Cook, we know now from a proxy statement Apple file with the SEC is protected by $310,000 worth of personal security.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   Which is tiny.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   Which is actually tiny.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   Apple, protect your CEO.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.600]   Oracle spent $1.6 million for Larry Ellison.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   Amazon spent the same for Jeff Bezos.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   Alphabet spent $600,000 for Sundar Pachai.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   What's hilarious to me as a Canadian is I always had these images in my head of seeing like Reagan and Bush and all the secret service and the motorcades.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   And then I was in Ottawa just visiting and you see like the leader of the country just sitting there having dinner like on the patio.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   I actually like that.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.600]   Maybe there's like one copper on the side.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   I like that.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.600]   I have a copper.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.600]   That's what you have is your secret.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   I'm watching Victoria on PBS.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   She gets in her carriage and rides around in the park.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.600]   You know, and she's got a couple of guards and a horse behind her.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   It's crazy.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.600]   Just go for a walk.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   You used to be able to go get cheese in the White House.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   Remember Jean Cretino someone threw a pie at him and there was no security around.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.600]   So he choked the guy out himself.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.600]   What are you doing Canada?
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.600]   Yeah, you like a Prime Minister that can choke a guy out.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   Brian Crazinich, CEO, former CEO of Intel, $1.2 million a year.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   Mark Zuckerberg in 2017 cost the company $7.3 million.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.600]   It will be according to 9 to 5 Mac 10 million by 2018.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   Okay.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   Well, that's a special gift.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   If anybody is at risk of having a shoe thrown at them, that's the guy.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   So I'll tell you what to round out this whole discussion.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.720]   If Apple's committed to this and Apple ought to be because I think it's a great opportunity
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.600]   for them, we'll know the minute they let you use DuckDuckGo and Safari on iOS.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   They buy DuckDuckGo.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   No, don't buy DuckGo.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   That's the problem Andy was talking about with one company has too much information.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   I would just settle for a request here.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.240]   Like as soon as you launch Safari for the first time, like don't do it when you start up the
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240]   compute like the iPhone.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.160]   But the first time you launch Safari, I'd just say do you want to have Google or
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.160]   research to be?
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.040]   But and until Apple does that, I'm sorry, Tim, you can run all the materials you want.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.560]   But that $9 billion is clearly speaking louder than your desire for privacy.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.560]   Period.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.880]   I mean, I like to point out these sort of things.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.040]   I also like to point out how they deal with foreign governments.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.480]   But that doesn't minimize my respect for the fact that they didn't have to do this.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.680]   They didn't have to start off this letter that invites cynics and and ne'er-dewell's like
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   me to say, yeah.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.440]   So what about this thing they're doing?
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.200]   They're kind of cozy with China or something.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.120]   Or how come they're still taking money from Google?
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.040]   Really, you need to have a company to be the first one to stick their foot.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.240]   They're foot out of the tent and see if it gets bitten off.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.640]   And Apple is doing something they didn't have to do.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.320]   And that's we need to get that conversation started.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.720]   And we don't want this conversation to be started by a disaster of even larger proportions
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.600]   that we've seen with previous data breaches.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:17.440]   You know what? I think it's time to take a deep breath and get calm.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.440]   Better out.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.440]   Good year.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.440]   With calm.com.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.720]   You have to say that carefully.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.880]   Calm with an L in it.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.600]   Calm with no L in it.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.640]   Oh, I'm on my calm site right now.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   Look at this.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.800]   It's very should should I really listen to our daily calm right now.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.720]   Welcome to the daily calm today.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.480]   We'll explore the deceptive nature of comfort.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:49.760]   I'll have to I'll have to stop right there because otherwise no spoilers.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.160]   You may not know why comfort is deceptive.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.920]   There is so much good at calm.com for meditation.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.840]   I've mentioned the sleep stories.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.360]   That's I want Matthew McConaughey reading me my sleep story tonight.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.440]   This is all about wonder.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.280]   Hello there.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:17.080]   I'm Matthew McConaughey and tonight I'll be reading a special sleep story called wonder.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:22.200]   Before we begin, as you settle in under the covers with your head easing into the pillow
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:28.520]   and your body sinking into the mattress, like it'll let your mind drift with me for just
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.520]   a minute.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:36.400]   You actually get a whole bunch of these from a variety of readers, including Steven Fry.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.400]   Steven Fry, you want to hear Steven Fry's?
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.400]   Bye bye.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   Bye bye.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.400]   Now we're talking.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.400]   Ah, hello.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.400]   Hello, I'm Steven Fry.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.480]   Oh yes you are.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   And tonight I'll be reading you a few lullabies.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.920]   I'm soothing these.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.120]   Oh, I can't keep playing this because I'm going to fall asleep.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.120]   No.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.120]   This is so great.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.760]   There's music on here, a variety of music that you can work to, that you can relax to,
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.120]   that you can sleep to.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:12.920]   There is of course advanced training in all sorts of things like peak performance, breaking
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.160]   bad habits, living beyond fear.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.280]   Oh, I got to do this one.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.200]   Social media and screen addiction.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:28.880]   Calm is the number one app to help you meditate, sleep, relax and live your best life, your

[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:30.840]   I always thought he was kind of sleepy, happy little zis with tea.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   Aww.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   Show you guys.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.840]   Ah, yeah, baby.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   Look at that happy little cloud.

[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.440]   Hello, I'm Bob Ross.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.960]   And I'd like to welcome you to the 20th Joy of Painting series.

[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:25.000]   It makes you sick, makes you unhappy, and this is the stress antidote.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.760]   That dude on the stir.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.920]   Do not disturb.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.480]   I do that now on every app.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.480]   Yes.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.680]   I turn off, I don't want notifications on anything.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.240]   And then of course, do not disturb from like 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:41.400]   I do do not disturb from 7 a.m. to 6.59 a.m.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   You do it all.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.400]   No.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   I did that.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.560]   I didn't even know I was missing some stuff.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:50.280]   I turn it on and then I open up contacts.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.440]   So if you're in my contacts, you can call me.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.440]   If you're not in my contacts.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.440]   That's the way to do it.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.440]   You just set up.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.600]   Only people can call who I know.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.680]   So what you do have to get good at is if there's somebody new, you have to put them in your
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.080]   contacts or you won't get them back.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   But I very quickly.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.480]   They'll get to leave a message.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.360]   Well, my message on my phone says.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   Don't leave me.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.720]   No, my message on my phone is, hi, this is Alex.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.760]   I don't answer this number and I don't check my voice now.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.040]   So because I believe that if someone wants to call, if you're not in my contact list and
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:23.680]   you want to call me, the proper way to do that is to contact me and set up a call.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.800]   And then we'll go to go to meeting and we'll or whatever we're going to use and we're going
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.400]   to set up a call that's more than 24 hours from today because I don't know you yet.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.040]   So like once you're in my contact list, you can call me anytime you want.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.680]   But if you're new, we'll just set up a call.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.320]   You know, I was still really low.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   I was still calling me.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   Apple to take VIP.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.880]   I would love Apple to take VIP out of email and put it in contacts.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.520]   Like I just have a group of people who no matter how they want to get in touch with me,
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.200]   like my mom, you know, like family members who I need to know about.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:54.400]   But let me do VIP for messages for phone, for email, for anything, not just for email.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.600]   Can you help me with VIP?
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.080]   Yes.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.160]   It doesn't work for me.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.760]   So look, here's my, so this is an Apple mail, right?
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.840]   I've got VIP turned on.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.880]   I've got, I've got all of my VIPs, my kids.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.840]   And no, none of them end up in here, just this one.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.440]   And that was because my name is in the email.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.800]   So why is VIP not working?
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.960]   It should, as long as the person has a sender name, the same that's in the VIP list, and
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   you have to add per email address.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.760]   So if they're sending from a different email address than you added, you have to have them
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.480]   in there for each email address you want.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.360]   But then it should just work once you've added them.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:36.840]   Yeah, should just work.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.840]   I ran out.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.200]   I think there was a limit for a while of 100, but it seems to have gotten rid of that because
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.800]   I'm adding more now.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.480]   I have the, I just tell her when all of Abby's addresses in here, I get email from her all
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.080]   the time and it's never shown up.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.720]   And same thing on your Mac as well.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.000]   Yeah, I don't think it shows up in my Mac either.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   What?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   See, I have a three digit code that I give people that I say, just put this in the subject
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.160]   and you'll, and I'll get it.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.160]   That's a good idea.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.520]   And so, and then there's a filter that just says at the very first filter says, if it
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.320]   has this three digit code, it will go to this folder and I always check that folder.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.320]   That's smart.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.880]   And that's because I have my email address.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.360]   I've been using it for almost 20 years.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.680]   So it's like, it's almost useless.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.000]   I finally turned off Gmail because it is useless.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.240]   Little code.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:23.440]   But I got, so I set up a personal email server and I have a special address.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.960]   But I'm really reluctant to give it to anybody because I don't want it to get out.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   Right.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.280]   And I don't want to, like I should give it to you and Andy and Renee, but, but I, but
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.640]   I don't want to publicize it.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.360]   Which maybe I'll do the code.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   That's a good idea.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.360]   Good idea.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   And I put a good idea.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.800]   Faux Pauses, turn it off and on again.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.560]   I just keep declaring email bankruptcy because I look, I get home and because my email address
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.840]   is public like yours, there's like 3000 messages.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.840]   I can't go with it.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   Yeah, I need to do that.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.160]   I mean, I'm in the infinite mailbox, you know, there's zero, zero mailbox or whatever.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   I'm in the infinite.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.160]   I'm in the infinite.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.160]   My all my inbox.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.480]   Merlin on that side of the galaxy and me over here.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.800]   I got right now I have 98903.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.520]   I'm almost to 100,000 in my 100,000.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.520]   109,198.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.080]   There you go.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   See?
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.640]   I'm, I'm the same way it's like this is, this is where like all the mail goes and then
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.960]   it gets put someplace else if it's important.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:27.920]   But see my big, my big problem is with all the people who don't understand like clearly
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   defined rules.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.560]   I used to, I used to have like a second phone that I would actually answer.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.000]   And I said, okay, now remember that if this phone rings in my pocket, that means I'm going
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.800]   to drop everything I'm doing because it's not only for special, special people, but also
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.560]   for special, special people under special, special circumstances.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.280]   And within two months, I was getting the, the hi, well, you didn't answer your first
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.280]   phone.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.280]   So I thought I'd call you here.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.280]   Hi.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:00.760]   Make sure you got the email that I sent and it's like, boy, I think that any, I think
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.880]   that any time you have a special scheme for email, you need to keep that totally secret
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.880]   from everybody else.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   Everybody.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.080]   Everybody, everybody just thinks that you just send email to this one address.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.640]   They don't know that there's a secret code.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.480]   They don't know that there is a secret, whatever, because otherwise it's like, there's that
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.960]   there, I've never been angry with somebody that was like, again, I literally had to run
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:27.240]   out of like an event because it was, oh my God, well, they wouldn't, they wouldn't be
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.320]   using this number unless it was really, really important.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.600]   And it was, we're just wondering if it just get back to me some of my next three or four
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   days.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:42.640]   I'm like, so I, one thing I am using this email server for is I have a catch all account.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:47.600]   And I whenever I sign up for everything, anything I have, it'd be that company at the catch
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.840]   all account.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:53.080]   So now I know if they give away my email or sell my email address, at least I'll know
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   that.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   Right.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   But then what do you do about it?
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.880]   So it's hopeless, basically.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.880]   It's hopeless.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   It's hopeless.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.880]   I have an email address.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   No one knows.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   And I'm keeping it that way.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.880]   It's really quiet.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.880]   There's no email on it.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.880]   I love it.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.880]   I go there and home and email today.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   It's good.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.120]   It's a not-co-lindsy at the port.com.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:20.120]   Actually, what it is good for is it's another level of security when, like for last pass
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.960]   and stuff, instead of using my public email address, when I sign up for accounts and stuff
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:30.120]   I want secure, I make up a weird email address at my server that no one would guess.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   Right.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.120]   Right.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.720]   And then so they'd have to know that plus my password plus my second factor to hack my
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.720]   account.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   That's pretty good.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.280]   That's three things that have to know.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:45.640]   For me now, I have my password manager has a very long phrase that was from my childhood
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.160]   that is personal to me.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.280]   I don't think anyone would get it.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.800]   And then everything else is hashes.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   You know, it's just--
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   It should be.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.040]   But it does cripple in every time I go to something that if I have to--
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.040]   You can't type it in.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.040]   Like I can't type it in.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.040]   64 of that?
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.280]   So my wife wanted me to type into Amazon in her so that she could look at something and
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   I'm like, I don't think-- you understand?
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   I can't do that.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.400]   I can't just type it in.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   There's no--
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.440]   Well, I know what I did actually for that reason because I ended up having to log into
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.440]   Amazon a lot.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.120]   My Amazon password is like eight characters.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.440]   I should probably fix that.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.440]   Mine's really long.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.440]   Mine's a 20-digit hash created by LastPass.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.600]   You know, it's like not.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   It should be.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.280]   It's hysterically funny.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:31.960]   My eBay password was five letters long because it's that old.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   It was-- it was-- I changed years ago, but it's not like something recently did.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.840]   But it's like I kind of like the fact that, wow, this is like the one-- this is the last
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:46.000]   password that I have from like the '90s that survived all the way.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.960]   It's like I kind of feel bad about-- oh, isn't that quaint?
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.400]   It's like an English word of five letters and this count has never been hacked.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   Oh.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.400]   Well, that is not--
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.120]   It's time for our public service announcement of the week.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:04.760]   And we're talking about collection number one, 773 email addresses, many, many, many, many,
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.240]   many passwords in the clear.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:12.480]   Troy Hunt discovered it on last Wednesday and put them up on Have I Been Poand.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.840]   Then Brian Krebs said, "Well, I was interested, so I got the name of the guy who's selling
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.480]   them, Sanixer, on Telegram.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   My contact with him.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.680]   He said, "Yeah, I'll sell you the collection one, 773 million records.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.600]   I'll sell it to you for 45 bucks because it's a couple of years old.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   I've got a much better database than that."
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.840]   Should have bought it.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:42.960]   So my suggestion is you go to HaveIbeenPoned.com, not owned, but poned with a P.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   Oh, well, and again.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.960]   Poned.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.360]   And then at the top of the page-- Carson, could you zoom out because you're not seeing
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.360]   it?
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.360]   I don't know.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.360]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.840]   At the top of the page where the menu is, there's a one for passwords.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.800]   That's the one you want to go to.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.240]   Everybody, trust me, has your email address.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   That's not the question.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.320]   The question is, do they have your password?
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.320]   And enter in your email password.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.600]   That's the first one I would enter in to make sure that that has not been breached.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.400]   See, I don't want to put it into there.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.120]   You could trust this guy.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.120]   You could trust this guy.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.120]   I know.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.120]   You know what you're asking?
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.640]   So it does not apply to your email address, but yeah, I know.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   Yeah, no.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   I completely understand.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   I know.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.960]   However, Troy is absolutely trustworthy, I think.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.640]   Or just go through Torbrazor.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.760]   And remember, yeah, he doesn't have your email.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.680]   So he would know what account that's for, just be a password.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.160]   All right, yeah, you're right, but this is a good way to find out.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.360]   I immediately entered some older passwords completely.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.200]   In fact, don't look, but I'll enter one right now.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:47.080]   Okay, now you can look and I'll press and it says, oh, no, this password's been seen
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.040]   four times before.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   What?
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:56.440]   So this password, which actually is my low security password that I use on apps and stuff
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.040]   that I don't want anybody to, I wouldn't enter your most secure password.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   Well, see, I think it's good to test your email password.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.120]   But if you, yeah, if you got your email password, you change it every month anyway.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.920]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.760]   One of the things I like about my email service is that it does, it's annoying as hell, but
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:18.120]   it will, like every password you let you create for it expires in just a few weeks and you
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.120]   have to choose a new one.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:24.920]   And it's like, I would, I would probably slip up once or twice or three times in a row.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.040]   I would do that more often if the propagation was in such a nightmare, like inevitably one
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.720]   device goes in correct password.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.720]   Oh, you entered over everyone.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.960]   And it's like 10 devices and you're like, I just want to change my.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.000]   Yeah, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   vegetables.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.640]   I mean, no, no, nobody, nobody likes green beans, but you, if they're on the plate, you
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.000]   got to eat them.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.920]   So anyway, just a little public service announcement.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.920]   Okay.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.080]   If you're right, if you're nervous about entering this into the Troy Hunt site, and I don't
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.920]   blame you for that, just go change your email password then just because we said so.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.320]   This would be a good time to do it.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.920]   And emails the most important because one password and last pass, if they would integrate that
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.680]   database and just one password has.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.680]   Okay.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.720]   One password has, have I been pwned in there?
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.600]   They're a sponsor of how I've been pwned.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.120]   It's my understanding that one password has that information in it.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.120]   I would love that everywhere.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.920]   Like every pop up and say, Hey, yeah, last pass should do it too.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.600]   Hey, you know, it's in there.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:29.600]   This, this Pwn passwords database has 551,509,776, 767 passwords, half a billion passwords
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.480]   that have been exposed in data breaches, not in the clear, not hashed or they were hashed,
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.680]   but poorly hashed.
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.760]   And so they were either in the clear or they were able to be discovered.
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:43.520]   Do we know how many of those were password?
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:51.000]   In fact, watch this, if you enter password in into the have I been pwned password field,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.680]   3,645,804 of them have.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.280]   If there's any password about admin.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.880]   Oh, yeah, let's try.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.320]   This is kind of a fun game.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.320]   Admin admin.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.320]   How many?
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.760]   Oh, 44,000 monkey 123.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.600]   Oh, no, 26 times before.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.040]   How about sword fish?
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   Can you try root?
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   Leo, root.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040]   That's a bad.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   11,000 times.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.880]   So you get the idea.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.480]   But that's one of the one of the few good things about all these data breaches.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:31.480]   They give these huge databases of actual in the real world passwords, make them available
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   to security researchers everywhere.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.800]   So that's why all you got to do is like every single year in December, you have used to
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.640]   have Mr. Blackwell's worst dressed list every year.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:46.080]   Now we get the list of 10 most popularly used passwords and there are 100 most popular
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.240]   used passwords and like half of them are always the same.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:55.360]   They're password or six or it's so it's a huge feeling that you're not clever to make
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.640]   you feel better, Alex, about this.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.680]   He has a link explaining how he protects his password.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.640]   You still have to trust him, but they're using something called K anonymity.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.720]   Cloudflare proposed it.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.400]   It's a hashing technique that keeps that password you're entering from being in the clear at
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.400]   any point.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.400]   That's all on the website.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.680]   The proud moment for me was my, I was talking to my nine year old daughter, I'm texting
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.040]   back and forth and she can't log into her iCloud account and I made the decision.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.120]   Like I am in another country.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.960]   I'm trying to figure this out and I'm just going to tell her how to get into it.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.640]   And I made the decision as soon as she gets in, I'm going to change it and everything else,
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.000]   but I'm going to give her the password.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   So I text her the password.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.320]   She goes, and I get this all caps from my nine year old going, what are you doing?
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.320]   Give me a password for her right on.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.120]   Now you know, you've talked a little bit about it.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.720]   You gave me a really hard time about it.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   I was like, I love that.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.720]   I'm going to change it.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   I've already made it to his words.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.880]   Man, sanitization.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:53.240]   He does a really clever thing actually, which you can verify because the hashing is done
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.720]   in your, is done client side in your browser.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.680]   So you could see what it's sending to Troy.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.800]   I will say that the, I do feel more secure with the long phrase, you know, like a long
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.480]   obscure phrase that means something to you.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.960]   I don't know if that's more secure or not.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:10.200]   I guess if you leave anything for long enough, it's English words, but if it's not known,
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.920]   it can't be from a book or can't, it has to be something that's anyway.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:18.760]   What I do with the same thing is I take the first letter of each word and then I might
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:24.120]   even pad it with a phone number or some other numbers that you know, and that makes it,
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:30.040]   I think, a pretty obscure, but if it's English, I went for my phone now because I did a phrase
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.320]   is like, it's like 20 some characters.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:37.280]   And when you don't, when facial recognition doesn't work, you're like, Oh my goodness.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.600]   You know, I don't like, I thought it doesn't, when you're having a way to have misspelled
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   curse words in it though.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.440]   If you want real security, misspelled curse words and multilingual.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.440]   I do everything in late speak.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.840]   Ours or zeros.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.280]   I was like, Oh, yeah.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.280]   Fling on.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.680]   So this is just a little PSA that these breaches continue passwords are often included in these
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.520]   breaches.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.840]   Probably a good idea to change your password.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:05.760]   And if possible, and this is what Brian crib says, use to factor everywhere you can.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.240]   If you can use it, use it.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.520]   And ideally, let's add one more thing.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.440]   That second factor should not be based on an SMS message.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.440]   Yes.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.040]   Good friend of the show.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.880]   Uh, guy, you, I don't want to say his name because I don't want, uh, I don't want to
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:27.320]   expose him to any more damage, but he, uh, Facebook messaged me the other day and said,
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.840]   I just, so you know, I, my SMS was a hijacked.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.760]   They got the second factor and my, all my accounts have been hijacked now.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.560]   And it's been a hell of a time fixing this.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:44.120]   But this is a very easy thing to do either hacking, uh, the phone, SS seven radios or
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   with social engineering.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.640]   It's getting some card.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.520]   And, uh, SMS is not a good choice for two factor.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:57.120]   If even if they don't use SMS, if the fallback is SMS, if your bank says, and my bank does
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:02.800]   this, well, if you can't use authenticator, we'll text you a pass a six, but that's as
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.080]   bad as just, we'll just use text then because that's what the hacker is going to do is
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.080]   it.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.080]   Oh, I lost my authenticator.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.240]   I don't know where it is.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.600]   So that's, that's, that's also another reason to remember too.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.440]   It's a good idea to backup stuff.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:20.880]   Even, even backup stuff you have in the cloud because you don't know, you, you, at some
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:25.240]   point you've got 500 gigabytes, 600 gigabytes of stuff in your Dropbox, Dropbox, Dropbox,
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:29.120]   some of it like five, 10 years old and like archival sort of stuff.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.680]   And if something unforeseen should happen, it all goes away and it's going to be, might
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.080]   be really hard to get back, but it'll be really easy to get back.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:42.480]   If at one point you decided to spend $80 on a, on a hard drive and just drag that folder
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.680]   to a hard drive, then disconnected from anything.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:51.880]   I've actually taken on this year doing something crazily analog, which is printing my photos.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.040]   Like I have a, you got a good photo printer.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.040]   I know, I know.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.920]   Like I just decided I was like, if you really bummed if I lost some of these photos.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.240]   And so I, you know, they're, they're in like four different places.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.120]   So the most important photos I have, but I was like, I think I'm actually going to make
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:09.560]   a paper copy of some of them just, you know, just in case everything, everything I write
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.760]   that's important also gets printed and put in a three wing binder.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.200]   I would, I would, they're, they're books that I've written that are terrible.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.480]   Not always ever written that are terrible.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.920]   They have no interest in publishing or showing to anybody.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.840]   But if that file ever were to disappear from my documents folder, I'd be really upset
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.680]   because for six to 10 months of my life, I thought that was the most brilliant book
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:29.680]   ever written.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.920]   And that's, I at least want proof that I can, that I occasionally do write.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.720]   I have the opposite problem when I was in high school, I wrote a role playing game,
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.480]   completely illustrated, like 400 pages, everything.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.600]   And I only have the physical copy because it was done on a Mika page dream.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.000]   And I have no way of getting data off of hard, high density and Mika disks.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   Right.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.240]   Well, see, but you had it printed.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.200]   See, so yeah, but I want it.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.760]   I want the machine version.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.760]   Right.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.560]   Somebody can get that for you.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:53:02.400]   There is, there is no freaky, silly, obscure, discord file format that somebody has an emulator
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.400]   in a Raspberry Pi.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.520]   It can proudly tell you how to get that data back.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:13.080]   Even, we're already in the rattle.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.400]   So what, you know, what's, what's.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.400]   We're already in here.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   You're not digging our way out.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   Go ahead.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.000]   I had a friend of mine a while back.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.480]   Well, it's just, we're just like Congress.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   We're just chatting.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.600]   Well, I just, I was going to some old files and I found like where all my love letters
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.120]   between myself and my, and my now wife.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.720]   And I apparently, apparently I, I encrypted them because I didn't want them.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.280]   They were just snoop on them.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.560]   But now I have no idea where the password is and I don't even have the computer or the
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.360]   piece of software that encrypted it.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.080]   And I have no way of getting at it.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:48.920]   And I said that I did, I did like exactly 20 minutes of research and said, you know,
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:54.600]   I could buy a couple of graphic cards and basically brute force that password at this
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:54:00.840]   point because in 1993, they had no idea that like math processing would be at the level
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.600]   it is right now.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:06.800]   And we would run the computer for about no longer than a month and a half.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.880]   And we get that, we get all that stuff back again.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.600]   And he thought about it and decided that no, no, it's more, it's more romantic.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.560]   The idea that these are these letters are even a secret for me.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.360]   And I'm like, that's not the what you do.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.120]   You brute force the technology.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.680]   But that's the, but that's the sort of thing we're talking about that there's nothing that
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.160]   can be stored that can't be retrieved.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:30.880]   So that's why like even when we're emptying out like my mom and dad's house, it's like
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:35.480]   that I'd see like an old laptop of dads or in the trash.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:41.000]   And I'd say, wait a minute, rip out the hard drive and smash it with a hammer because any
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.160]   sort of data can be recovered from anything.
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.160]   That's sometimes a good thing.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.160]   Sometimes it's a bad thing.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.800]   Literally took, we were, we literally took all these old drives that we've had for years
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.200]   that probably don't even run very well.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.480]   And there's no reason for us to have them.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.920]   And we took a bandsaw and literally cut them all in half.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.400]   And it was all these old hard drives.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.480]   You know, just, just a, a raw hard drive.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.000]   So how we did backups.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   And we were like, it's just too much risk because we have all this camera work of executives
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.200]   on stage practicing and things, you know, like all this other stuff.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.680]   And we were just like, let's just get rid of this.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.680]   Which is not have it around.
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.560]   Literally hundreds of disks got cut in half.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.680]   It was kind of fun.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:24.080]   So I thought I'd ask your comments on this editorial from Apple insider William Gallagher
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.000]   and Mike worthily.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.840]   Apple's management doesn't want Nvidia support in Mac OS.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.440]   And that's a bad sign for the Mac Pro.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.680]   I didn't realize this, but Mojave doesn't allow Nvidia GPUs.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.680]   I guess I knew that.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.840]   There's no drivers for it.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.920]   Is it they actually don't allow it?
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.800]   I don't think they, it's not that they don't.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.880]   So my understanding as of a couple of years ago and might have changed is that there was
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:49.880]   a couple of things.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.560]   One, there was an incident where Apple was using Nvidia parts and they had a problem.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:58.440]   And Apple felt like Nvidia totally abandoned them on the issue that it was an Nvidia problem.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.040]   And they failed to support it.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.160]   And they basically threw Apple under the bus for it.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.480]   And you know, that sort of thing makes Apple cranky and Apple has big institutional memory.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:11.520]   But also when they started to work on metal, AMD was happy to give Apple complete access.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.440]   You can write to the metal, we'll get completely out of your way.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.600]   If people want, they can use a card, but if not, you can just blast it.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.000]   Like if you want to use OpenGL, it's fine.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.240]   If you want to use this, that's fine.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.520]   But if you want to go metal straight to the metal, that's great.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.520]   And Nvidia is like, no, we're Nvidia.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.920]   You use CUDA and you like it.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.000]   And Apple's like, but we want to use metal.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.120]   And now you have these two very successful, very proud companies who both want their way
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:35.720]   and have failed over the last two years to make an agreement that best suits both of
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.600]   their combined users.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:44.040]   So Nvidia complained last October that they said Apple fully controls drivers for Mac OS.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:48.520]   Unfortunately, Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it's approved by Apple.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:54.520]   There is no support for Nvidia graphics cards in Mojave or later.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:57:00.520]   So this hostility, whether it's going to limit you or not, does an EGPU still need
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:01.520]   to have a driver?
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:02.520]   I guess it does, doesn't it?
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:03.520]   It does.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.920]   And I think it's a lot of people who have experimented with and some of that quite a
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:10.840]   lot of success for it, but they're not official drivers still, which is an annoying thing.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.820]   And actually, I kind of aim this at you, Alex, because I think you would like Nvidia's
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.820]   support.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:18.820]   All right.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.560]   So Nvidia handles, and I'm not going to get into too much of the detail, but it handles
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.160]   the graphics in a much different way than ATI.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.720]   And so, or AMD.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:33.840]   And so the way it chunks the data is much easier to manage in large.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:41.920]   So ATI is definitely much more of a game-oriented, very small chunks process.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.280]   Nvidia tends not to be that way, and it tends to be easier to deal with large data sets.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:50.280]   And so Nvidia is a better card.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.640]   You know, then the ATI ones.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:56.440]   The problem is that Nvidia wants to write their, as Renee said, Nvidia wants to write
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:01.160]   their drivers, Apple wants to write the drivers, because the graphics system is so part of
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:06.000]   the actual OS that they don't want to give up control of that process.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.480]   And it's for a lot of good reasons.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:14.040]   And so both of them have good reasons for why they're trying to manage control of that.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:17.480]   And the issue is that they're not going to.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.640]   They're at an impasse.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.240]   I don't see how they get out of that impasse.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:25.200]   Unless, I mean, Nvidia, Apple doesn't really need Nvidia, and Nvidia doesn't really need
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.200]   Apple.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.280]   I think that's the bottom line.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:31.440]   It's a little frustrating, though, for those of us who want to use, I mean, for instance,
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:38.360]   this new RTX card from Nvidia, which does real-time ray tracing, is using AI for interpolation,
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:42.520]   is really, they call it deep learning, super sampling.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:47.640]   So anti-aliasing is twice as fast, and it really looks amazing, right?
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:53.440]   So it's a little frustrating for people who want to do this, particularly with an EGP.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.360]   You look at the technical reason why you could--
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.360]   Quake example.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:59.600]   Yeah, there's a Quake 2 update.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.600]   It's the same Quake 2 engine.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:04.960]   Someone posted a video on YouTube of someone playing Quake with ray tracing, and it was
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.720]   a-- it's nifty.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.720]   This is Battlefield.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.720]   But yeah, let me show you the Quake, because it's now available.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:12.200]   The reality is that it is an edge case, though.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.120]   I mean, from a day to day, the average person's using for this, I think that--
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:22.920]   I can understand where Apple would say, we're going to put Radeon chips in our computers.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:26.800]   But why would they not allow me to use whatever I want in an EGP?
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.160]   Because they don't-- they want to write the driver.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.160]   They want to write to the metal.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.160]   And they don't want--
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.160]   It's part of a bigger battle.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:36.040]   Yeah, it's a much bigger thing, and they're not going to give any odds, because they don't
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:40.520]   really have the game space on desktop anyway, so it doesn't mean anything to them.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.520]   Here's a Quake 2 with ray tracing.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.320]   What's funny is you're using the same engine.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.320]   You're upset.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.920]   You're using-- it's the same game, and you could see, in fact, how crappy the textures
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   are.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:54.760]   But when you get to lighting, it's like, whoa, what's going on here?
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.920]   You can blow stuff up.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.360]   Yeah, we've got to get somebody to blow something up here.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.360]   So that's--
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.440]   It's bad for the pros who want CUDA cores.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   That's really the issue.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.280]   That's why I ask Alex, because-- okay, yes, either you go see with the explosion.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.040]   You don't-- gamers are one thing.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.800]   No gamers going to buy a Mac if you're really a serious gamer in any way.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.680]   No pros are going to-- no heavy-duty graphics pros are going to buy a Mac either.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.680]   That's frustrating, though.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.360]   I mean, if you want to make a Mac Pro--
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.800]   It's going to take a long time for them to do that.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:29.640]   So the problem is that the Mac is so-- I mean, the Pro-- I mean, I have-- so for the heavy-duty
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.280]   graphics stuff that I have, I have PCs and--
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.120]   You're going to use Windows machines.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.120]   --machine machines.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.080]   And I've got big ones that cost-- I mean, I have Linux machines--
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.080]   Are there good Linux drivers for Nvidia?
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.080]   Nvidia writes them.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.720]   Well, I have Windows machines that cost $15,000.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.200]   I mean, they have more than one big GPUs and tons of RAM.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.000]   And that was to build them from scratch.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:58.120]   And so there's-- you have that heavy-- I don't expect my Mac Pro to be able to do that.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.600]   I don't expect the new Mac Pro to be able to do that.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.320]   So I don't have that expectation that if I'm going to do heavy 3D graphics, that I'm
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.400]   going to expect my Mac to do that.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.160]   And I don't think that-- I just don't think it's a big enough market for Apple to really
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.360]   pay much attention to.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.080]   I do expect it to be able to perform well when it comes to 4K or even 8K video, which
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.640]   Apple is spending a lot of time making sure that that stuff is going to work into the
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.640]   future.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.640]   And so I'm happy with that.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.800]   When I want to do video editing, I'm not using a PC.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.240]   I'm using my Mac to do that.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.640]   But when I'm doing heavy-duty 3D graphics, I'm--
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.640]   You never use a Mac.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.640]   It's a pipe dream.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.640]   Or gaming.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:38.720]   But it is kind of a sad reminder of how topsy-turvy the Pro line has become where--
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.200]   I think that a consumer line should work from the top down where it's always the company
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.640]   and the designer saying, we're going to define what this is for and how you use it.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.520]   That's going to simplify the choices for the user.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.040]   It's going to also increase the value for the user.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.680]   When you have a Pro line, though, it really has to go from the bottom up where it has
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.160]   to be the user is paramount.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:03.360]   Whatever the user wants to do with this thing, that thing should be able to support that if
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.680]   not because of features that are built in, at least because of roadblocks that were not
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.120]   going to just sort of institutionally place in its way.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.880]   So when you're starting to charge $3, $4, $5, $6, $7,000 for a desktop, I think the purchaser
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.920]   has the ability-- has the power to say, hey, if I want to use an NVIDIA graphics card,
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:28.320]   and the only thing in your way is just giving NVIDIA a little bit of help and assigning their
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.640]   driver, you're going to sign that goddamn driver.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.680]   You're going to sign that damn driver.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   Exactly.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.640]   It's at what point do you say that, hey, how much money do I have to get?
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.040]   Do you give Apple before it will let me do something I want to do with a piece of hardware
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.480]   that I putatively owned?
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.520]   So what does the word pro mean?
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:49.480]   I think you have to define what-- yeah, I think exactly what you said.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.000]   You have to define what pro we're looking at because I think that Apple has a strong
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.080]   base of video pros and not a strong base of 3D pros.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.000]   And I don't think they're going to ever get those 3D pros back.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   But I don't care.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   So I don't care.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.120]   Again, if I decide that the Mac is best for my workflow, I would understand if you're
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:12.360]   saying-- if Apple was saying that we're not going to build a Mac with 17 PCI slots because
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.480]   we just-- that's just ridiculous for the things that Mac user wants to do.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.720]   But when it comes to software, when it comes to all you got to do is support this company
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.720]   that wants to write a driver for this product that will just look like a existing point.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.640]   I know it's not quite that simple, but this is-- again, this is not a startup company
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.600]   that's trying to find-- it's a third-ratt of financing.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.600]   This is Apple.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.640]   They've got the resources to do that.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.120]   And I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of pro users are walking away from the
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.560]   Mac because the value proposition is just eroding year after year after year.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:49.000]   Well, I think that they walked away from the Mac because the trash can was a trash can.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.920]   And it was good for about a month.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.000]   And it's not upgradable.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.480]   There's a lot of other things there.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:00.880]   The number of pros in the video world is so much more than the number of pros in the 3D
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.360]   Apple could expand their market if they just took care of that market really well.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.080]   I think that high-end area is so tweaky.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.600]   It is so hard to make everybody happy.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:15.760]   I mean, I worked in this-- I've been in this industry-- that 3D industry for 30 years.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.160]   And it is so tweaky, no matter what you do, someone's going to be upset that they can't
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.920]   put this little thing in and they can't do this thing and they're going to be upset
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   about it.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.840]   And so it's going to be this-- it is a whack-a-mole problem that you have to-- the problem is
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.960]   every time you add a new thing that you support, you add a new liability and a new thing that
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:39.480]   is going to be more engineering time and so on and so forth for what Apple-- it's a relatively
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480]   small market.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.000]   And this is-- I'm a hardcore Mac user.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.800]   I mean, I use a Mac 90% of the time.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.760]   When I do the hardcore video stuff that I need to do-- or hardcore 3D stuff, then I
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.360]   switch over to Windows or Linux and live streaming I do on Linux on Elementals.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.480]   So there's all these things that I just switch over and I would love to have it done on a
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.480]   Mac.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:06.040]   But I think that the problem is that it's not just allowing NVIDIA to add a driver.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.480]   It is forking the development on the Mac.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.440]   And it means that there's new resources and there's new people that have to support that
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:17.360]   and there's new things that are going to go wrong and there's a whole bunch of new levels
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.920]   of things that they have to manage in an area where they're probably not going to make
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.920]   those people happen anyway.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:30.160]   You know, like, that part of the world is so far away from Apple now, it would just be
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.480]   an incredible amount of work for a relatively small amount of revenue.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:39.720]   It's-- it's-- of course that's rational.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:40.720]   But it's-- it's--
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.720]   I would love it.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.920]   You got to get-- I hate going-- switching it on my Mac.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.920]   It's rational.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920]   I just go, you know, I've given up on that.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.360]   For the end user, it's like a girlfriend that's breaking up with you.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.560]   It's like, I want-- I love you.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.880]   You know, but I don't-- I don't care.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.960]   You know, what I'm hoping is is what-- like, my dream is that Apple's going to give us
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:01.280]   this kind of three-- a three U that you can take the ears off.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   Set it up and make it look pretty.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.000]   Or you can put a three U and slide it in and they build like new modular things that
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.400]   let you add three or four.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.160]   But, you know, the fact that they're not supporting Nvidia tells me they're not going
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160]   to do that either.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.680]   Well, but the thing is that there's lots of other things you want to market though.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.960]   No, because you can put multiple ATI cards in.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.320]   You could-- you could put, you know, like being able to support all of that.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.400]   And if Apple stays true to, we're only going to have these ATI cards.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.400]   You could put four of them in there and the OS could theoretically just address all of
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.400]   them.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.800]   And so there's a lot of things that Apple can do if they don't fork it that I think is
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.800]   possible.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.040]   Oh, I see what you're saying that they could do better because they're just doing the
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.040]   API.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040]   Because of the whole OS.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.880]   Because right now, okay, we can have a driver and we can address it and we have to write
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880]   special code.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.680]   But what if the OS just did everything you wanted it to do?
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.680]   And you didn't have to do it.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.440]   And the only way to do that is to have absolute control over that pipeline.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.880]   By the way, my iMac Pro just completely-- that's about me.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.920]   I want Renee to tell me if this has been fixed.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.400]   I remember that there was a big issue with the T2 and kernel panics.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.400]   Bridge OS.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.000]   Bridge OS 3.0.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.520]   My iMac Pro still randomly restarts.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.960]   I think almost every night restarts and I look at the log and it's bridge OS crashing.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.120]   Is that still a problem?
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120]   I thought that was fixed.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.120]   I thought it was too.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.120]   I thought it was too.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.120]   But I'll double check.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   I haven't seen it.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.400]   I'm not a pro but it happens on my iMac Pro all the time.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.400]   My iMac.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.360]   It restarts about every 10 days.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:32.680]   This one is-- I let it go to sleep and then I come back in the next morning and it's restarted.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.720]   And it says ignore report.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.240]   And if I do the report, it's always bridge OS.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.240]   It's kernel panics.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.000]   Mine hasn't restarted in months.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Okay.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.160]   So maybe just come wrong with me.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.160]   It's my fault.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.320]   No, it's never you, Leo.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.560]   It's always a damn machine.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.560]   I'm beginning to think.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:52.120]   I've had problems with every Pro Mac, iMac that I put in there.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.120]   I don't know.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.560]   But you see, most people only buy a couple every decade.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.960]   You buy one every three months.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:57.960]   It's true.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:58.960]   It's on the log averages.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.960]   It's true.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.960]   Usually it's RAM.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.360]   I don't mind having it shut down.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.560]   It doesn't shut down while I'm using it.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.760]   It shuts down when it's idle.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.160]   For almost my entire career--
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   I think it's RAM.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:12.200]   From almost my entire career, the stability of one machine versus others--
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.200]   It's RAM.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.200]   --has always been RAM.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.800]   But I'm using official RAM.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   I know.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.800]   But there's a lot of it, though.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.800]   So maybe it's just--
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.040]   That was funny, because when I spoke to them about the MacBook Air and people complaining
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.000]   about the lack of changeable RAM, and they're like, "Well, we do that on the Mac Mini because
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.680]   hobbyists like it, but on the Air, if we just sold it on the board, they never have any
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.840]   problems with it anymore."
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.840]   That's true.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.840]   Right.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.840]   Until it fails, in which case--
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.920]   Hey, I wanted a new MacBook Air after only two years.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.920]   Yay!
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.160]   I really like my MacBook Air.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.120]   I have a MacBook Pro with an INI, and I have an iMac Pro on my desktop, and I've always
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.080]   always thought my MacBook Air.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.360]   It's just light, it's easy, and it's fast enough for what I--
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.360]   Mostly what I do.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.800]   We'll take a break, come back with more in just a moment.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:04.600]   If you're a fan of lost in translation, I have some good news for you.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.480]   But first, a word from ExpressVPN.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.920]   I think we don't have to explain to this audience what a VPN is.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.320]   It's a virtual private network.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.720]   It encrypts your traffic between you and some point out there.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.760]   The idea being you can surf safely and securely in an open Wi-Fi access spot if you're sitting
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:26.440]   here watching the show as we have people doing it, and you're on an open access spot.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:29.360]   The guy next to you, he kind of looks like a hacker.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.280]   He could be watching your traffic.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.080]   So a VPN encrypts that traffic all the way out to the VPN server.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:37.080]   Same thing with your internet service provider.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.040]   Do you really know what they're doing with the information they're getting?
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:47.240]   Every single time you do anything online at home, ExpressVPN is the best of VPN.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.280]   It will protect your online privacy.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.920]   It eliminates geographic restrictions.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.600]   We know you're being tracked online by social media sites, by marketing companies, your
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.360]   mobile provider, your internet provider.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:04.400]   They can record your browsing history, and we also know they often sell it to other corporations.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.400]   Want a profit from your information?
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.880]   Look back your privacy with the best VPN service.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.400]   Number one, according to tech radar, it's ExpressVPN.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:22.520]   Easy to use apps on every platform, of course, iOS, but also Mac, OS, Windows, Android.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.800]   They run seamlessly in the background on your computer, your phone, your tablet.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.320]   You turn them on with one click, you turn them off with one click.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.640]   It secures and anonymizes all your browsing by encrypting your data, hides your public
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.840]   IP address.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.320]   And because ExpressVPN has servers all over the world, there's always one near you that
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.920]   you can use for speed.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.480]   There's always one in any country you want to appear to be in.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.560]   I love that.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.280]   And they have a 30 day money back guarantee.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.840]   So why not try it right now?
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.400]   It costs less than $7 a month.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.920]   Now you might say, well, wait a minute, Leo, I can get something for a buck 99 for a lifetime
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.920]   subscription.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.760]   Well, let me tell you, if a VPN company is charging you a buck 99 for a lifetime subscription,
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.080]   they're making money some other way.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:08.000]   And I'm sad to say a lot of these other VPN companies do things like insert ads into your
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.320]   traffic.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320]   They literally do that.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:17.040]   They have JavaScript insertions or they're logging and selling that data, not ExpressVPN.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.200]   $7 a month.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.200]   It's a great price.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.720]   It's a very fair price.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.080]   And it means that they can effectively give you great service, high speed, complete security
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.080]   without logging, without injection.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.240]   They do it right.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.600]   If you don't want to hand over your online history, your internet provider or data resellers,
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:39.240]   or that hacker at the coffee shop next to you, ExpressVPN is the perfect answer.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   Protect your online activity.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.880]   They find out how you can get three extra months free when you buy a one year package.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.360]   That's basically 15 months for the price of a year at ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:56.160]   ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak three extra months with their one year package.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.760]   This is this is the one you've been looking for.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:02.000]   This is when I use ExpressVPN.com/Macbreak.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   NFL ticket.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   NFL ticket.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.680]   That's all we have to say.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.680]   NFL ticket.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.000]   If you're in Pittsburgh, no, no, see the problem is if you're anywhere in the United States,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.880]   they black out, they blind out all the stuff.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:13.880]   It's frustrating.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.320]   Just in case you're wondering, and if not that I would ever do this, no, because it would
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   be wrong.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   It would be wrong.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:27.000]   But if you buy the NFL ticket in Delhi, none of the games are black out.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   No games are black out in India.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   Who to thunk it?
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   No, they're all there.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.240]   They all figure if you're in Delhi, you probably like cricket.
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.960]   And so we'll just let you watch football.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.040]   And then if you did that, then you could air play to your TV.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.440]   But we'll see what Al has doing is that he's helping out these broadcasters by pointing
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.360]   out inefficiencies and flaws in their security so they can finally take some action and stop
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.280]   getting these little people to just hurt them and hurt them and hurt them.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.280]   That's what Al is concerned about.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:57.480]   He's not trying to get people to find their way around the system.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.480]   Did you know that I said it?
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.480]   I ruined it for everybody.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.080]   Did you love lost in translation?
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:06.960]   Bill Murray, that great Sofia Coppola story where he's in Japan, Scarlett Johansson.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.040]   They're both jet lagged as hell.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.880]   They go out a night on the town in Tokyo.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.280]   So what a wonderful movie.
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.280]   It's kind of slow.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.280]   What?
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.280]   There's no shooting.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.080]   Did you watch it at 1.5x?
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.580]   John Wick 4.
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.580]   I would have.
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:20.580]   I would have backed that.
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.480]   I was just like, I'm not very good with Alex.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.280]   Alex, I've seen the work your company does.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.760]   If you were disappointed there wasn't any shooting in that movie, you could have fixed
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760]   that.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.920]   Little grade screen here.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:39.720]   Actually, I just don't watch then the new Netflix movie, I/O, which is about, which
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.080]   is a wonderful movie, but is the slowest sci-fi movie ever?
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.920]   Is it slower than Unbreakable?
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.920]   It's funny as I kind of liked Unbreakable.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.920]   I don't know why.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.920]   I did too.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.920]   I used to don't like slow movie movies.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.920]   I can't get my wife once, here we go.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.040]   That was the slow and I'm almost across the table.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.520]   Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola are teaming up again.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:09.120]   This will be Apple's first feature film under their new partnership with A24 on the rocks.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.960]   Rashida Jones will co-star with Bill Murray.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:17.640]   Coppola's script, she's of course the director and writer of Lost in Translation.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.640]   It follows a young mother who reconnects with her larger than life playboy father on an
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.200]   adventure through New York.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.200]   Sound a little bit like Lost in Translation.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   Just a little bit.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.200]   Who's Murray playing?
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:34.160]   I think he's playing the Rashida Jones character.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.200]   I'll tell you, Apple continues to...
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.600]   I think this is just someone just pay Bill Murray just to follow him around.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.600]   Because you just...
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.600]   I know.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:43.600]   There's a documentary...
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.360]   There's a documentary of Bill Murray.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.160]   They just follow him around though.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.160]   I'm just so curious about what his life...
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.600]   But that's the Bill Murray documentary.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.600]   It's like following him around.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.600]   What was it following?
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.600]   I thought it was just showing and talking about all the weird...
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.600]   The way that Bill Murray cited him.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.600]   I was like, "I don't like that."
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.720]   But I don't think it's an actual glimpse into Bill Murray's life.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.720]   It's just...
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.520]   It's about urban legends around him.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520]   Okay.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.320]   I like the cover.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.320]   Bill Murray's stories.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:16.080]   Well, and the fact that he doesn't have an agent, so you just have to call and leave
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.680]   a message and people just call him.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.680]   He might call you back.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.120]   And everybody decides to do it.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.120]   He'll just do it.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.120]   He'll be like, "Okay, that sounds like a good idea."
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.120]   That sounds good.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.120]   I love him.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.120]   You got to love him.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.120]   He's a...
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.120]   He's a pho...
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.120]   Iphone...
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.920]   Apple's selling the iPhone SE again?
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.920]   What?
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.920]   They were...
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.920]   They were...
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:34.920]   They were getting rid of old times.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:35.920]   Too late.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920]   At a stock.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.680]   $299 for the 128 gig unlock versions.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.680]   What a bargain.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.680]   $249.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.280]   Why would you even buy a 32 gig?
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.280]   Because they have one.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.280]   They have one.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.280]   $249 when you got...
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.280]   Oh, because they have them.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.280]   They had them around.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.280]   So the idea was this was in the warehouse.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.280]   Somebody found them.
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   Hey, Jill, what are we doing with these?
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280]   Let's put them up on the same.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:58.280]   I don't know.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.280]   Are they new or are they refurbished?
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.280]   They could have been the ones that came back.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.280]   They were new.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.280]   Okay.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.280]   It's all gone.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.280]   I think they were literally like someone found...
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.280]   We got a creative SEs over here.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.280]   What we haven't been telling the other ones, let's get these out.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.720]   I mean, this happens all the time with companies.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.640]   And usually they just bury them in the desert or something.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:14.640]   Well, why not?
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.640]   No.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:22.480]   Well, there are companies that actually just put returns into the grinder because they
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:28.800]   don't want the pricing to be devalued by the presence of underpriced overstock merchandise
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:29.800]   on there.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.360]   So I'm glad to see these things hit the secondary market.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:39.920]   As a matter of fact, there were home pods, reconditioning home pods for $220 last week
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:42.160]   or late last week.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.360]   I almost...I would have been the perfect opportunity for anybody who had one who wanted to pair
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:49.400]   up a stereo one because they came with like a 90 day...
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.400]   Not...
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400]   Apple.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.400]   Apple weren't you, but at least if something...
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.520]   If they started to fire with a 90 days, you get your money back.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.520]   Apple has...
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.400]   I think this happened last week.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:06.320]   Renee mentioned it released their new smart battery case, the case that swallowed the
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.880]   canary.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.040]   And there was a little confusion.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.040]   Nine and five, Mac.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.240]   Do we not have it?
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.240]   She left her any...
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.440]   Okay, Megan has it, but it looks the same as the old one.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.440]   So if it goes all...
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.440]   You have it there?
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.360]   Goes all the way to the edge now.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   There's Renee.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.760]   Oh, he's got all of them.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.400]   I liked all three.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.360]   So there's black, white and what?
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.360]   Off-black.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.360]   Got it.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.360]   Got it.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.360]   Got it.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.360]   No, there's just...
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.360]   There's an iPhone X...
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360]   iPhone Xs, Xs, Max and XR.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.520]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.240]   And there was some confusion, nine and five, Mac said initially that the...
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.240]   Because the smaller milliamp hour...
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.400]   This is why Apple probably doesn't say the capacitor.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.760]   This is exactly why.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.160]   Because I was ripping on them during iOS today because they never say they just give you
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.800]   hours of life or whatever.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.600]   It's a 10.1-hour battery.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:59.600]   Go ahead.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.880]   But it's two cells.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.360]   So what happened was...
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:05.840]   Apple sent out a few review units and one of the reviewers took a photograph of what I
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.280]   think was the capacity of one cell in milliamp hours.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.320]   But a lot of people will tell you that milliamp hours is no longer a very good indicator
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.960]   of what it can do with the battery because we have so much power management now that
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.960]   it's the efficiency, not the...
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.960]   It's the watt hours that count, not the milliamp hours.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.960]   Yeah, the watt hours.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.960]   Totally.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.960]   And it would Apple did a switch to a two-cell battery.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.160]   So you actually have two cells in there.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.360]   And together, they happen to be higher milliamp hours in the previous one.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.960]   But it's like you said, it's 10.1 watt hours.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.960]   Okay.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.840]   So it is bigger capacity than the old...
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.280]   Yeah, and it's bigger.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.560]   And it has a lot of features that are unique because it's from Apple.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:46.080]   For instance, you can see its charge in your notifications.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.640]   It charges wirelessly.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.840]   I don't think there's any other battery case that'll charge wirelessly.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.560]   Mophie's new one, I think.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.200]   Well, I think it's slightly different.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.880]   Yeah, I think it does full wireless pass through.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:01.280]   Well, this one goes wireless to the case and then lightning to the phone.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:05.400]   So basically what happens is your wireless charger charges the battery in the case, which
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.040]   then charges the battery in the phone.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040]   It's super smart.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.040]   So this took a while, too.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:12.400]   So what Apple has this technology called smart charge.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.520]   And the way it works is it figures out how much power is coming in through the lightning
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   port.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.960]   And then, for example, if you put it into a giant MacBook Pro battery, it's like we've
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.960]   got power for days.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:26.200]   We'll just fast charge both of them to 50% and then leave them charging after that.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.960]   If there's less charge though, it'll prioritize fast charging the iPhone.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.640]   And then whatever is left over the iPhone fast charge will go to the case.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.440]   And when the iPhone hits 50%, it'll split it evenly.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:39.840]   If you give it like a rinky, dinky iPhone charger though, it's going to take all that
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.440]   power for the iPhone first until it gets to 80% and then split the charge with the case
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:49.160]   so that it always manages to give you the best charge you can for iPhone and then incidentally
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.640]   charge the case until it gets halfway and then charge both.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.440]   Wow, that's kind of amazing.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.440]   It has a lightning port on it.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.560]   It costs a lot, $129.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.760]   That's more than anybody else.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.360]   And how much, so what has your experience been?
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.960]   Is it because I know you're Pokemon going with this thing on it?
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.960]   I did.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.280]   I always use it for a Pokemon event because that's the best indicator.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.680]   And usually the batteries last about four hours of like nonstop Pokemon.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.840]   iPhone 10 hours already a champ, but iPhone 10 are with this case.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.840]   I feel like I could go for three days, Leo.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.000]   I love the 10 are.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.720]   I have to say the size is perfect.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.680]   The battery life's mind boggling.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.840]   I don't mind the LCD screen at all.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:30.000]   I think it's like 29 additional hours of video with the case.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.400]   It really is.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:36.800]   I was using it for like again for the I started playing at 6 30 in the morning and I think
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:41.280]   I finished it around noon one day and I played from like 10 in the morning till six the other
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.840]   day because it was a two day event thing.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.560]   And I never got close to running out of battery.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:49.520]   I think I depleted the case, you know, about seven or eight hours later and the phone was
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520]   still mostly full.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.320]   More importantly, did you get a shiny Grood on?
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320]   I did not.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320]   I'm so salty.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.040]   I did so many raids.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.560]   People will understand when they say there's a one in 19 shot, they think that if you do
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.800]   19, you get one.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:07.120]   That just means they're rolling a 20 sided die every time and you could roll one every
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.400]   time every time.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.720]   And really that's what Renee did statistics are horrible.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:19.360]   The only thing wrong with this case, it's still but ugly.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.360]   It's yeah.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.360]   So the design.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.800]   So the principle here is that they.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.800]   So this is the original one.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.360]   If you look at the original one, they really wanted nothing but the battery on top of the
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.200]   case and then they shrink wrapped the whole thing.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.760]   Like the small, the least we could possibly do.
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.160]   But because they had a chin, it would get in.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.640]   There is RF interference in battery cases, which is why you put your battery, your phone
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:38.640]   in the battery case.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.640]   A lot of them get really hot because the phone can no longer connect.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:44.720]   So it ramps up the radio and that uses that way.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720]   It's the battery.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:46.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:47.720]   Well, you're trying to charge.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:52.360]   So Apple put a battery, a passive antenna array in the old case in the new one.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.800]   They chopped off the chin completely and they made that new antenna system.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:00.480]   The new antenna system works with the case so that you don't lose any signal and that
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.480]   prevents it.
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.600]   It gets a little bit warm, but it doesn't get hot like when I put it in a mophie or some
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.680]   other case.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:11.240]   And then also because Apple has good iOS integration proprietary iOS integration, it knows to stay
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.240]   in mobile mode.
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:15.720]   A lot of cases when you plug them in, it thinks it's plugged into a wall outlet.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:16.720]   Oh yeah.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:20.480]   So it spins up all the updates, the photo sinks, the cloud sinks and it starts again using
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.840]   a ton of power.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.200]   And the iPhone case doesn't do that.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.320]   It keeps it in mobile mode.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.240]   So it keeps it in low power mode.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.320]   So you really are getting the maximum benefit of all that charge.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.440]   So it's expensive, but you're getting a lot of technology.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.360]   You didn't address the butt ugly part.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.360]   No, it is.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.360]   It is so ugly.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:39.080]   But I mean, the alternative is to it is horrible.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.360]   I don't know if it is still as ugly.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.160]   I think it's I think it's it's a little less ugly because it goes to the edge now.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.080]   So it went from rump from hump to rump.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.240]   Leo, that's basically what we have here.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.240]   We used to have a hump.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.240]   Now we have a rump.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.240]   This case has got back.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.520]   If it's me, I guess I'll get one.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.120]   Be good for Pokemon go.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.120]   Yes.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.600]   I don't know the way they'll be a red one.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   I actually carry.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:04.160]   I just keep a I have a phone size type C battery that I just carry around with it.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.440]   It charges really fast too because of the power delivery.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.440]   Well, how do they support power delivery on this?
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:12.280]   I thought that was a type C thing.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.680]   No, I don't.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.680]   So not not.
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.920]   No, because the iPad has been doing power delivery for a long time.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:18.920]   Okay.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:19.920]   You get the much bigger iPad charges.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.760]   It's a faster charge spec, but it doesn't.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:25.880]   The lightning cable, because you plug the lightning cable into a USB-C charger and you
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.880]   get PD.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.480]   So it's like the lightning cable can carry it.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.280]   You just need the USB-C brick on the back.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.280]   Makes sense.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.280]   That makes sense.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.720]   That's the advantage of owning the technology.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:38.040]   What do you think of the rumor that there is a rumor that they're going to use type C
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.360]   on the next generation iPhone?
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.080]   So one thing I just wanted to add before this is there is some confusion.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.600]   Apple is shipping all these depleted.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.600]   So people are getting them and they're not charged.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.080]   And that's because of the shipping regulations.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.200]   It's much easier for them to ship if they don't charge the battery, if it's not a device.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.760]   But it can't always wirelessly charge if it's empty.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:58.000]   Like it needs a little bit of power to add an handshake.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.120]   So if you just put it on a wireless charger, you'll see the light, but it won't charge.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.640]   You got to plug it into lightning for at least a few minutes to wake it up and then it'll
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.840]   handle all the wireless.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:11.920]   Another caveat, 9 to 5 Mac, points out that it will fit your iPhone 10.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.920]   It's actually my photo.
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.240]   That's their stole your photo.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.640]   I recognize that wall anywhere.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:20.640]   Failing to it.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.640]   Bastards.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.640]   Bastards.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:28.160]   Richie now says it's it does it does at 12 if you have 1213, which just came out this
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.760]   morning.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.840]   It will work, but within consistent results.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:33.840]   So which is it?
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.840]   Which is it?
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.840]   Richie.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.840]   So I've had some issues.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.680]   Other people, it's just been a little bit flaky for me.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:42.440]   So and I was talking to a lot of people about this because I got my review unit at the same
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.440]   time.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.120]   The Verge did and wire cuttered a bunch of others and like the Verge, they were just putting
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.360]   any phone, really nilling it seemed to work for them.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.200]   It did not work at all for me at first.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.160]   So I updated and rebooted and then the iPhone 10 works in the iPhone 10s case.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.880]   It wasn't working the 10s Max case for me, but I guess for safety sake, I would never
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.760]   do that anyway.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:05.760]   But if you have iOS 12.1.2, I think it'll give you that warning and you can dismiss it.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.080]   If you have maybe if it's earlier than that, if you have 12.1.3, it should just work fine.
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:14.120]   And the answer doesn't fit the camera exactly.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:19.400]   And the stereo, Apple optimized the stereo cutouts for that wide stereo effect they have with
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.400]   iPhone 10s.
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.640]   So people who actually can hear sound, not like me, like all music sounds the same to
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640]   me.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.000]   They might notice a difference, but nobody's been complaining about it so far.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.280]   It's just an additional thing.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.200]   12.1.3 came out this morning.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.680]   Anything else is security patches, things like that.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.680]   And bug fixes.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.680]   Bug fixes.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.680]   Performance improvements.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.840]   But one of the beauties of being iPhone users is we'll all get it.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.240]   And iPad 2, we'll all get it.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.520]   So now let's talk rumors.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:54.800]   One rumor says Apple likely to drop LCDs entirely next year.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:26:00.520]   Not this year, next year 2020 and go all led, which why not?
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.680]   As long as you can get them, right?
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.920]   Some people have a negative, some people actually have a problem.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.880]   So there's a bunch of mitigations that people use to stop OLED from burning in.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.920]   And one of them is frequency modulation.
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.440]   And some people can see that and it causes vertigo for them.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.200]   So they will always ditch an OLED phone and get an LCD phone if they can.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.320]   So there is a small contingent of people who would not be very happy if Apple goes all
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.320]   in on OLED.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.040]   But I think for people who don't have that condition, they want as many OLED phones as
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.040]   they can get.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.960]   This was actually buried in a Wall Street Journal article with a headline that might fool
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:31.960]   you.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:35.840]   Apple supplier in Japan looks to tie one for bailout after iPhone 10 hour let down.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:36.840]   Okay, fine.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.840]   Apple Street Journal.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.080]   But really this is the story.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.000]   Apple likely to drop LCD displays.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.080]   There's not enough like we've seen Apple and Google have been throwing money at LG and
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:51.760]   other companies desperate to increase not only to remove Samsung's stranglehold on the
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:55.200]   OLED market, but just to increase the amount of OLED screens available because everybody
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.280]   wants them and there's not enough to go around.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.320]   The Apple's paying, I think the rumor was it was played too high.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.920]   The rumor was Apple's paying 120 bucks per screen at first for those.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.400]   And that shoots up your bill of goods.
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:12.280]   And do you think Apple will put a Type C connector on the 2019 iPhone?
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280]   I think so.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.560]   There are rumors for a while that Apple and Google were trying to get rid of ports and
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.600]   there was a strong rumor that the Pixel 2 even would get rid of ports, but they couldn't
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:22.600]   figure out remote recovery, which is a problem you have with Apple Watch.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.280]   And if anything goes wrong in the installation, you've got to go to an Apple store.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.880]   They got it working on Apple TV so you can remote recover, but with Xcode and that's just
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.800]   not a consumer friendly solution.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.840]   As far as I know, maybe it's easier now, but you've got to be real because a lot of people
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.800]   say, oh, just ditch the port, but you've got to be solid because you can't give people
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.520]   a phone, which is so important to them.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.520]   And then if it freezes, have no way for them to do anything about it.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.520]   That's a really good one.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.240]   But going to USB C now, I think people wouldn't be as angry.
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.560]   I think if they did it too soon after lightning, because we forget like we love it because
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.680]   we're nerds and we have USB C everything.
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.160]   And literally it would be so convenient for me right now to just have a USB C cable.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.400]   I love it on my iPad.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.400]   I love it now.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.120]   People are like, I have an iPhone and I bought a bunch of lightning stuff.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:06.600]   And if you touch it, I will cut you because they could care less about USB C.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:10.320]   So they have to balance those two things.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:16.320]   It's not desirable though to have Type C on your laptops and your iPad pros, but not
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.800]   on your other iPads.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:20.480]   It seems like a market is so much bigger for iPhone.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.120]   The trajectory once the iPad went that way, I think is go see.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.120]   But you're right.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.920]   The iPhone is a market that stands alone.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:27.920]   It's a massive one.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:31.360]   And we also know that the minute Apple goes all in on Type C, USB consortiums.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.360]   It's just going out.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:33.360]   I'm just so angry.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.880]   I know that's going to happen.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.880]   Apple, this is an interesting story.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:45.160]   Supposedly working to subsidize Apple Watch for at risk seniors through Medicare, private
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.760]   Medicare type B plans.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.360]   That would be very cool.
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:53.800]   According to CNBC, Apple's been in talks with at least three private Medicare plans about
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:57.320]   subsidizing the Apple Watch for people over 65.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.120]   Just a couple of years from now, I'll be able to do that.
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.120]   To use as a health tracker.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:14.720]   That's a real escalation of what the role of the Apple Watch is because now it's really,
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:20.400]   really valuable in terms of creating a herd immunity sort of thing of collecting so much
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:25.920]   data about senior health and senior data and senior movement and senior pulse rates.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.520]   If they get the EKG data in there as well.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:35.800]   But there's also going to be as much time and as much money that has to be spent on elder
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.240]   care to begin with.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:41.280]   If you're adding now, we have to investigate every single piece of data that doesn't correlate
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.800]   with previously collected data.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.320]   That could be a bit of a problem.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.360]   It might be a more interesting, it'd be less worrisome thing if we were talking about a
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:54.560]   simpler fitness tracker as opposed to a full bore Apple Watch because the watch is collecting
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:30:02.680]   weeks of data that's going to be available to primary care physicians.
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:03.960]   I don't think it's a bad thing.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:10.000]   I think the really important thing is detecting falls, detecting changes in gate and again,
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:16.640]   collecting and amassing that sort of data to be able to preventatively say perhaps at
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.320]   this person's next checkup, they should be checked for Parkinson's because this person
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.960]   seems to be stumbling a lot more than they used to and their sleep is now changed in
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:30.840]   a way that has not been, that was a lot different before they went on this medication.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:35.920]   But there's a lot to be talked about about how sometimes collecting too much information
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:40.240]   is actually contrary to a patient's better interest health wise.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.320]   I think that individually, I think you're right.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:46.840]   I think that as a group, and you talked a little bit about this, but as a group, I think
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:53.120]   that having a huge amount, a huge sample of lots and lots of people, especially in an
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:57.720]   area where they're at risk, over time is going to be able to give us early indicators
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:04.720]   of problems that happen months or years before the real issue occurs that we can't see right
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.440]   now because we just don't have that sample.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:10.720]   And so having that kind of constant data collection, I do think over time is going to
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:11.720]   be life changing.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:15.280]   I mean, we'll be treating people for things that we know are going to be a problem two
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:20.720]   or three years from now that we weren't even aware of at the moment.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.480]   Well, but again, there are two different things that are going to be, that you hopefully will
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.360]   be a benefit of this sort of thing.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:31.520]   One is, again, you're collecting so much data from such a wide sample of people that
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:36.840]   now we can build a much better AI model, for instance, for taking this small indicators
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:40.360]   and building it as something that maybe we should be checking on this for this patient
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.360]   later on.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:46.440]   The other thing is that we've been seeing lots of data coming in about the ACG feature on
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.600]   Apple Watch.
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:52.880]   And a lot of this stuff is, isn't it?
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.000]   My heart was racing.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.720]   I didn't know why.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:00.800]   So four or five days later, I went into the hospital, I went to see my doctor or get something
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.560]   checked out or went to the emergency room and was able to show the data and the doctor
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:10.440]   was able to look at that data and say, "Okay, well, you had a little AFib incident.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:11.440]   You can't treat it.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:13.440]   We don't know if that's a problem or not.
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.160]   You don't have any other symptoms whatsoever.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.360]   It has an effect on your health.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.760]   Here's your bill for $3,000.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.120]   Thank you for coming."
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.600]   And that's not necessary.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:26.120]   It hasn't been demonstrated yet as something where, "Oh, thank God you came in and we're
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.440]   going to put you immediately into this ICU.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:31.920]   We're immediately going to put you on this therapy because if we had not known about
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.840]   this, you would have died."
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:37.400]   We're not getting a whole lot of data on that yet.
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:39.640]   We won't be expecting to do that data for years.
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:48.240]   But remember that one of the possible outcomes is that a moment that passed pretty quickly
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:51.960]   now arrives for the sort of data that says that, "Great.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:55.600]   This is one of those many things in medical science where this weird thing happened.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.160]   We don't know why you seem to be perfectly healthy."
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.400]   But I guess I would say it's weird right now.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:05.480]   But with enough sample years from now, enough samples, that's what I'm saying, the difference
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:09.440]   between we're collecting so many samples that in the future we can train an AI or train
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.440]   actual doctors.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:14.160]   Here's where we can correlate between this data was collected and this was the patient's
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.120]   healthy year or two later.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:21.680]   We just have to make sure we don't get that confused with the watch on my wrist diagnosed
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.040]   a problem that I was having.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:26.360]   And, gosh, I would have had a heart attack within three months if not for the fact that
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.480]   this watch told me that I was about to have a heart attack in three months.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.440]   That's not a reasonable expectation.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:37.960]   This has a danger of sort of tamping down the potential of these devices because when
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:41.640]   people say, "Well, I gave one to my sister and she died anyway.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:42.640]   What the hell?"
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.880]   I was $40 back.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:49.800]   Come on, I gave you an Apple watch.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:54.720]   Actually, the funnier parts of it is like when you're on Reddit and other places about
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:01.120]   the Apple watch forums and you say, "Well, I was having going out to dinner with my
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.240]   husband and here's the exact moment where he said that he wanted to divorce and you
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.080]   see this one spike up to two hundred.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.240]   You see in a lot of these now.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:13.480]   It was exactly eight or from Sunday during the football game.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.840]   I've had two times where my watch said, "You're seated but you have 120 beats per second.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.840]   I'm watching a stealer game."
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:21.840]   I don't have that problem.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.840]   Good job.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.440]   Excellent fidgeting.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.360]   You closed your fidgeting goal for the day.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:35.160]   I have to say, lately, I have been just looking at the, when I got that bad news, did that
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.160]   spike my?
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:41.200]   I just find that I have a lot of arguments with my fitness rating because I was doing
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:42.200]   a bunch of moving yesterday.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.600]   It was a lot of carrying stuff up these stairs and putting those coverings and sweat and
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.600]   I looked down and I was like, "Really?"
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.520]   All I got was 200 calories.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.520]   Come on.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.520]   Come on.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.240]   That was a lot of work.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.360]   Let's take a break.
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:35:01.880]   When we come back, my friends, my gentlemen friends, my boyfriends, if you will, let us
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:05.680]   have our picks of the week, shall we?
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:12.640]   Meanwhile, our show today brought to you by FreshBooks, the easy to use cloud accounting
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.760]   software that's helping small business owners thrive.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.320]   FreshBooks is double entry cloud bookkeeping.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.000]   When I say that, I know you go, "What?
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000]   I don't want to do that."
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.200]   No, you don't have to do that.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:23.360]   This is the beauty of it.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.240]   It's real accounting, but you're not doing it.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.240]   FreshBooks does it.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:33.560]   All you're doing is using FreshBooks to create beautiful, professional-looking invoices which
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.680]   you send to your clients.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.680]   You could see which invoices have been sent, which have been viewed, which have been paid,
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:40.680]   which are overdue.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.680]   Yes, you could see which ones have been viewed so people can't say, "Oh, I didn't get your
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.440]   invoice."
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:51.800]   You can accept online payments directly from your invoice, which by the way means you're
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.000]   going to get paid an average of twice as fast because it turns out as much as you don't
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.880]   like making invoices and I know what a pain it is because I hated it.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:03.160]   That's why I started using FreshBooks all those years ago.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.160]   Your client hates paying bills just as much, not because he doesn't want to give you his
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.160]   money.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.720]   It's a pain to sit down and do it.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:11.440]   Well, if it's just there in the invoice and there's just a button and you click the
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.000]   button and you're paid, that's why you get paid faster.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.240]   But look what you've got.
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.640]   You've got your accounts receivable.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:18.640]   The invoices are out there.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.680]   You've got your accounts paid.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.040]   You could put your expenses in there if you bill for expenses.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.880]   Just take a picture of the expense receipt.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.520]   It goes right in the invoice.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.560]   Even if not, you keep track of all your expenses right there in the app.
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:36.080]   In fact, FreshBooks will even automatically connect to your bank account and update expenses
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:37.280]   every day.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.560]   Okay.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.280]   So now you've got your costs, you've got your receivables, you've got your received.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:45.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.040]   It's done your books.
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:50.760]   It's done your books and you could quickly generate and access all the accounting reports
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:53.840]   you'd ever want right there in the FreshBooks dashboard.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:57.520]   For a lot of small businesses, it's the first time you ever knew that you were making a
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.480]   money or not, whether you were profitable or not, at any given time.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:05.960]   Usually, I would know when I filed my taxes after a year, but now you can know at any
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.200]   given time.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.680]   It's great, by the way, when it comes time to tax time because you can easily share those
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:14.320]   reports with your accountant and financial advisor.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.680]   It has all the...
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.200]   They have added an Accounting Reports tab in the nav bar, which gives you access to the
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:23.280]   numbers that matter to you, things like real double entry accounting functions.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:28.760]   They, in fact, they just had seven new features, including cost of goods sold, other income,
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:33.480]   general ledger, trial balance, charts of accounts, accountant access, balance sheet.
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:37.720]   I hate to say it even because it makes, maybe makes people go, "I don't know how to do that.
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.280]   You don't have to."
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.480]   This is all done just in the process of running your business.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.080]   Also new advanced payments.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.120]   Stock time is un-built, revenue streams.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.640]   I want you to take a look at the interface.
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:53.400]   We're going to give you 30 days free just to see what FreshBooks could do for you.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:57.960]   This would be a great time to start using FreshBooks now so that tax time next year,
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.160]   you got all the stuff you need.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.160]   It's all together.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.160]   You push the button.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.160]   It's done.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.120]   FreshBooks.com/Macbreak.
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:08.000]   Please, if you would put Macbreak weekly in the "How Did You Hear About Us?" section, so
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.400]   we get credit for it.
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:13.840]   FreshBooks.com/Macbreak, and you get 30 days absolutely free.
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.880]   FreshBooks is the best thing that ever happened to me when I was sitting out in voices and
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.160]   let it be the best thing that ever happened to you.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.160]   FreshBooks.com/Macbreak.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:32.160]   Andy and not Cole, do you have a pick of the week, my friend?
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.160]   Yes.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.720]   My pick of the week is a simple hunk of plastic that doesn't cost very much, that solves a
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:40.200]   problem with your Apple TV.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:43.400]   By a company called Total Mount, they make these really cool little mounting brackets
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:47.120]   for not only the Apple TV, but also the remote.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:52.920]   It doesn't make any sense that you have to have a shelf somewhere to support an Apple
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.360]   TV that does nothing but act as a junction box for various cables.
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:01.920]   Total Mount is this simple little but nicely made little box that you can either stick
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.600]   on the wall or stick even behind the television set that basically keeps it in place, keeps
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.760]   it off a shelf, keeps it off a table.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.080]   They also have even better a little remote storage thing, which every time I've been
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.480]   in a conference room and have had to wait 10 minutes while someone figures out where
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:24.800]   somebody left the little tiny Apple TV remote, I went to the first conference room where I
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:30.720]   saw a Total Mount where they just actually had this little remote catty just stuck to
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.120]   the back of the TV again so all they had to do is reach behind it and boom, there's that
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:38.080]   little stick of licorice gum in order to get things from.
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:44.000]   They make a line of stuff including stuff for other TV streamers and a couple of different
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.280]   security cams, but I did wind up buying a Total Mount Apple TV for the Apple TV in my
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.480]   bedroom and it's just like it solved the problem of just, have you ever had a problem
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:01.960]   where it's not really affecting your life but it's just offending you as a logical being
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:07.880]   that I've got this black box with cables dangling out of it on a shelf somewhere strictly
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:12.240]   not because I'm always plugging things in and out of it or because there's an infrared
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.840]   port that has to be like pointed at wherever people are seated.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.640]   It's just because there's no place to put this off on top of all that.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.000]   It solves a problem and it's also like 18 bucks on Amazon.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.560]   So you can hardly go wrong with this.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:28.560]   Very cool.
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.240]   I didn't even know about that.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:31.240]   That's neat.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.360]   It is not at Total Mount.com though.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.440]   It's at novellous.com.
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.200]   I think they sell exclusively through Amazon though.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.200]   Oh, okay.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.720]   Search for Total Mount on Amazon and you're done.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.800]   If you do go to the Innovelo site, you'll see middle-aged to young people in t-shirts
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:52.120]   smiling and holding products that are not stock photos but clearly your employees trying
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.240]   to do stock photography.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.040]   So if you're into that, definitely hit the site.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.640]   Alex Lindsey has his lips sealed but unsealed them for a moment for us.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:01.480]   Would you and give us your pick of the week?
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.080]   So my pick for the week is I had over the weekend, over the Christmas break, I had to
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.080]   write a report.
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.240]   That's what I do for a break is I write a report.
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.280]   So I had to write this 20-page report about live streaming and all these other things.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:19.920]   And so I decided as a challenge, can I build it all in pages on my iPad?
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.400]   So can I actually do it without my laptop and everything else?
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.400]   And it turns out I can.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.160]   And it's actually now that I've gotten used to it.
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:29.360]   So my recommendation is pages and actually my kids have gotten very good at keynote by
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:32.640]   themselves without almost any training at all.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.120]   They actually work really well.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:42.360]   But now that I'm used to pages on my iPad, I found that I'm frustrated by pages on my
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.360]   Mac.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.840]   So it just feels very quickly click when you get used to using it.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:53.120]   So it's definitely, if you've been not using it or not playing with it, it actually is
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.800]   pretty powerful and being able to touch the screen is pretty awesome.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:02.760]   So it was a big lift for me.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:07.240]   The first two or three days of it, there was a long string of swearing.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.640]   I was really glad my kids were in the room as I tried to figure out where something that
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:15.800]   I knew on the Mac was, where it was on the iPad and why it wouldn't drag.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.760]   And getting used to the modal nature of you're touching it for this, but not for that.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:25.000]   And so anyway, it does take a little bit of a learning curve.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.600]   But I will say that it's well worth it.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:32.520]   I've been kind of on this mode of trying to slim down my what I carry around every day.
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:37.320]   So I've been really working on making my iPad work and pages and.
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:40.680]   Isn't it amazing people just take it for granted?
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.640]   It's actually great for what pages?
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:45.640]   You can do a lot.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.520]   I mean, I was publishing the iBooks from my from pages and I'm at it, you know, gonna
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.520]   add movies and you can add it.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.720]   And I was complaining the other day because she didn't have word on the her new Mac or
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:56.720]   no, the new iPad.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:59.120]   And I said, well, just use pages.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:00.280]   And she said, oh, I don't think that.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:01.600]   And I said, well, just try it.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.080]   And she said, this is great.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.560]   You know, and you forget that it's there and it's free.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.520]   And the early days, it was a little sluggish.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:11.200]   Like it always felt like you were pulling me, something through molasses.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:15.920]   And now it's the performances gotten up to speed and you just get used to all the little
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:16.920]   things.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:19.280]   I haven't really used word regularly since pages came out.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.760]   So I've been, I've used it for a long time.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:27.720]   And when it comes to sheets, I'm not sheets, but, but numbers, I have to admit that I, if
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:33.480]   you're doing heavy numbers, like big spreadsheets that are like 10 sheets and they're
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:36.640]   all integrated, I can see that Excel might be a little bit faster.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:40.920]   But if you're just doing your little budgets or your checklist or whatever numbers is so
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:45.760]   much better than, than anything that else that's out there because you're not constrained
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:48.400]   to the, to the cell structure.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:51.720]   You can build like little, little ones all over the place and make you love numbers.
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.000]   I think numbers is great.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.280]   And I rarely need anything with more power than numbers.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.480]   I mean, yeah, I did a presentation and I handed, handed someone to it and when they
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:00.280]   were talking a little, what if we changed this calculation?
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.280]   I just went in and typed it.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:02.280]   He goes, what are you?
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.280]   He thought it was a page.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:05.280]   He thought it was a word to PowerPoint.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:07.280]   Because it looked so nice.
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:08.280]   It was all designed.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.880]   And I just started moving little scroll bars and, you know, moving things around it.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.800]   Once you get, what do you do that magic?
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.560]   Well, and it just looks completely formatted except that they're all integrated cells, you
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:22.840]   know, and so it's, it's, it's really powerful when you get, when you get used to it.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.040]   Anyway, I agree.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:28.000]   A little plug for pages pages and I would say and keynote and numbers.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.640]   I mean, everybody knows everybody knows.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:30.640]   Everybody knows.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.760]   The numbers is darn good too.
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.680]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:35.680]   Mr.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:39.640]   Renee Richie from iMore and vector podcast with his Canadian hat on.
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:42.800]   It says Canada like four times on that hat.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.440]   Just so that I can travel internationally safely.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.640]   Oh, no, that's a smart mode.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:47.640]   I'm just kidding.
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.640]   Don't don't attack the American.
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.640]   It is not read.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:54.560]   What can give us a pick.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.640]   So I was going to talk about the battery cases, but we did since we did that already.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.440]   I figured I would talk about that.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:00.920]   Talk about that.
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.080]   I recommend them.
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:03.080]   I think they're great.
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:04.320]   If you want to be able to.
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:07.480]   Yeah, if you want to go like camping or if you want to go on a road trip, for me, the
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:12.400]   worst is traveling because I go to an airport and airports always have really bad signal.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.320]   And then I start roaming and like the phones are world phones, but there's no accounting
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.600]   for how the different modems are tuned for the different towers around the world and
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:21.600]   different.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:24.440]   And it's just whenever I run the battery just drains precipitously.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:28.000]   And also because you're traveling so much, you're using your phone and not, you know,
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.160]   interspersing it with using computers or iPads or other things.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:36.000]   So whenever I travel, whenever I go to conferences, whenever I go to shows, I just I use these
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.400]   huge battery packs.
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:42.800]   And this case is it's heavy enough that you understand why people who say Apple should
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.680]   just double the size of a battery in an iPhone really, you know, would not like it if Apple
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:51.440]   actually did that because taking it off is like, Oh, I finished my dumbbell curls for
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:52.440]   today.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.520]   Now I can go back to just enjoying my phone.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.840]   But when you need it, if you have just the slim iPhone, when you need it, you could put
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:02.760]   it on and go camping for the weekend and go out for that Pokemon event or go traveling
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.960]   to Europe or whatever and your phone phone will last.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:10.360]   And again, it is a little bit expensive, but the quality of it, like from the materials
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:14.400]   to how they test it, how they protect the cells when they drop test and protect the
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:16.040]   screen, all these different things.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.080]   They put a lot of effort, a lot of technology into it.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.240]   So if you can afford it and you want it, it's really good.
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:22.240]   Nice.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:24.680]   The other thing I was going to mention is while we were doing this, probably just before
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:29.040]   we started doing the show, Apple announced their new shot on iPhone competition.
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:31.920]   So it's open to everybody who shoots with an iPhone.
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:38.440]   All you have to do, I believe is tag shot on iPhone and you show them your best work
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:43.600]   and they have some great judges like Austin Mann, who's done some terrific iPhone camera
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:44.600]   reviews in the past.
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.960]   But they also have some really cool judges from Apple.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:52.200]   They have Phil Schiller, who's a long time Fischianado, but they also have Kyan Drans
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:54.760]   who runs iPhone marketing at Apple.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:59.280]   They have Sebastian Marino, who's the head of the VP of software for camera.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.680]   They have, I'm blanking on his name now, but the guy who runs the camera team.
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:04.800]   So they have a deep pool of internal annex.
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.280]   Don McCormick, that's right.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:08.320]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:11.960]   Really great people, really great photographers, really great people who are familiar with
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:14.640]   how the iPhone shoots judging this.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:19.440]   So if you win, you get your picture up on billboards and in Apple stores.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.760]   And it's one of those things where Apple didn't invent this campaign.
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.880]   Apple noticed that people were hashtagging it, shot on iPhone.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:30.080]   And the best marketing campaigns are always the ones that are driven by your user base
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:33.440]   or always the sort of grassroots ones, the community ones.
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:35.760]   And Apple's doing a really good job of amplifying this.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.520]   So if you have an iPhone, it doesn't matter how old the photos shown there are iPhone
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:44.920]   7, iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, they're not biasing this towards the latest or the greatest.
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.280]   Just get out there and shoot.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.520]   And if you want to share and get a little bit of attention.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:56.160]   The shot of Petra in the job by Erdem Sommack is really good because it avoids all of the
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:01.720]   tourists and the booths and the stands and all the other garbage around the beautiful
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:02.960]   car things at Petra.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.520]   It makes it look so.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.040]   You've never seen a picture.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:09.040]   When I go to Petra, which I'm doing this fall, I'm going to take pictures where you
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.640]   see all the other stuff, just so people know.
[01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:12.640]   There is a great video.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:13.640]   It's like the Peter McKinnon.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.880]   Have you been to the snow monkeys in Japan?
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.880]   Same thing I want to go to Nagano.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:21.080]   Well, you're going to Nagano and then the Utanaka.
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:25.480]   And you go up there and it looks so pristine, but then it's like concrete and there's a
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:28.280]   whole bunch of people like literally really from the zoo.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.280]   Really it's a zoo.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.280]   It is.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.280]   It's a zoo with the zoo.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.280]   There's a great spot.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.280]   But without any fences.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.280]   There's a lot of monkeys.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.280]   The monkeys have a icon.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.280]   Why would they leave?
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:37.760]   Well, someone said, well, what if we get in them?
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:39.360]   And they're like the monkeys will not like that.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:40.360]   They will.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:41.360]   The monkeys are very strong.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:44.000]   We're not spending time at a hunt up for monkeys.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.000]   It's been pinging.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.160]   There's a great video from Peter McKinnon a couple of weeks ago called the bucket shot.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.160]   We're all his life.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.680]   You wanted to get this one shot in Alberta, this beautiful lake with snow and still water.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.560]   And you see him get the shot, but then it peels back and there's like 100 people around
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.800]   him trying to get the exact same shot.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:02.800]   And not get anybody else in at the same time.
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.640]   Well, and anchor Watts like that, if you go to anchor watt, there's two pools on either
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.800]   side of the main area.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:13.920]   And there is about 2,000 people on the wrong pool, which has a horrible shot of anchor
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.840]   watt because but the stores are over there.
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:19.840]   And I guess the tourists or the guides take them all over there so they buy stuff.
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.080]   And then there's like 100 people that know that the other side is it, but still 100
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:27.480]   people that you're trying to like move around and try to get your that one shot that everybody
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.440]   takes exactly the same shot.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:36.920]   I think that guy also has shot a video of like there's a famous like little sort of like
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:43.840]   washed out desert rock formation that does this beautiful lighting in Arizona.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:49.200]   And so again, this beautiful shot of like orange rocks and the sunlight streaming.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.680]   And he I think he did another video that was where he went there and was literally like
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:58.520]   you go on that you get the special photo pass and it's 20 people lining up to okay your
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:49:59.840]   turn step up here.
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:03.600]   And then the person who rains the tour will throw the sand in the air to get that sort
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.560]   of dusty effect like 10 seconds.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.560]   Okay, click next.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:12.760]   And yeah, that's that doesn't seem like that doesn't seem like the the adventure of creativity,
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:14.240]   uniqueness and expression.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.640]   It's Chris Mark where it was in vain against Instagram hashtags for locations.
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:24.760]   And there's even if you go to where was it was somewhere in in Utah.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:29.840]   They say, please don't hashtag this photo because it's just caused huge problems for
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:34.120]   a lot of these most the most scenic spots in the world because it's just all these people
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:39.640]   going, I got to get my Instagram shot of this, you know, yeah, that's that's the time of
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:40.640]   filming.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.640]   That's what it was.
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:45.960]   We if you go to the most famous famous landmarks in the world, there's always a unique shot
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:47.640]   to get there.
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.320]   And when you see a hundred people all into the same thing, you know that it's time to
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:54.520]   go go to try to find the other side of that thing.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:51:00.120]   It's just, yeah, I mean, I'm sorry, have have fun the way you would like to have fun, but
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:04.760]   it's sometimes there's a between photography and just doing a photo scavenger hunt.

[01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:33.040]   or something, but that's whatever.

[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:38.480]   want.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:42.440]   You know, there's there's a there's a line of thought that they're even sexier if you
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.880]   have a little bit of clothing on them.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:44.880]   Yeah.

[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:34.320]   I like I think I just like the 80 D side of it is like we have a conversation for like

[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:48.740]   I don't want it.
[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:49.740]   I don't want it.
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:52.180]   I don't get anything about it.
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:53.180]   That's my excuse.
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:56.820]   This is Twitter's problem is that it's exactly the way I want it.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:58.620]   Like I don't need anything new from Twitter.
[01:52:58.620 --> 01:53:01.020]   I just like I don't think Twitter knows what they want.
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:02.020]   So that's the hard part.
[01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:03.020]   Right.
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:06.060]   I just loved kind of watching it from afar.

[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:38.540]   So I did one on the secret history of iPhone, which is what I'm experienced purple and bait
