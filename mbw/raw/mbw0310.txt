[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.440]   Mountain Lion, have you adopted it?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.200]   And what's up with the new iPhone?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.640]   Will it really be out in September?
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.300]   It's all ahead.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.800]   Next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080]   the great Andy Ennaco.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.080]   He is like a rock.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.080]   He is like always there.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080]   Always there.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.080]   Like a Ford truck.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.080]   He's built Ford tough.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.080]   Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun Times, the celestial
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   waste of bandwidth and points north.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   Good to have you.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080]   Good to be here.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   Also with us, unusually, but back again for two weeks
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   in a row.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   I am like a ghost.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   New world record.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   Ghostly Alex Lindsey from Pixel Core.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   Great to have you.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080]   You're going off after this, though.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.080]   You've been to London since we were here, or Sydney,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   or something.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   I was in London in Sydney a couple of weeks before.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080]   Where were you last between the last show and this?
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080]   I was in DC last week, and then I'm in Houston this week.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.080]   Wow.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080]   You get on next week.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.080]   It gets around.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.080]   But I've set it up so that a lot of these are end of the week.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   So I leave like Wednesday or Thursday and then I'll come back on Tuesday.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   So Dwight Silverman who writes for the Houston Chronicle says
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   Houston is undergoing a renaissance.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   It is the new Austin.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080]   It is a place to be.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080]   I can't wait to see it.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.080]   So with me, I usually don't see anything other than what I'm doing.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   I know you work hard.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.080]   But you play hard.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.080]   Speaking of which, where is the Martini Shaker?
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   Also with this.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   I left it.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   I forgot it.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   From Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   Aaron Hill, I guess, is here.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.080]   It's good to have you back.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   Good to see you there.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.080]   From Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   What brings you out to the West Coast?
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   Well, I just had some meetings to do with the, you know, it's Big Nerd Center.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   Big Nerd Center?
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   I also had to come out and correct you.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   You know, last week you started talking about my book.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080]   Where is my book?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.080]   Oh, I brought it home because I'm studying it.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   Nice chart.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.080]   The new book.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.080]   And everyone was really excited about it.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.080]   Basics of iOS program.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.080]   That's right.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   Objective C, the Big Nerd Ranch guide.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   But it's not that new.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   It came out in November.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   I just waited a while to send you one.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   It's new to me.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   You were busy.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   I just wanted to send it right away.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   It's new to me.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   And I've started reading it.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   It's fantastic.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.080]   So this is for people, you have many books for advanced programmers or programmers who
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.080]   are coming from other platforms.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   This is for people who have not programmed.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080]   Exactly.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   So it starts at the very beginning.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.320]   And if you've done something like PHP where you're not familiar with pointers and addresses
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.640]   and things like that, it's also a nice way to get started with those C ideas.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.640]   And will it be enough of Objective C to do desktop programming as well?
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.640]   So it's not just iOS.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.040]   It actually walks you through doing your first iOS application and also doing your first
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.040]   COCO desktop app.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   COCO is awesome.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.840]   Aaron worked at Next.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.120]   And that's where you learned Objective C because that was how the Next Stop Running
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120]   System worked.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000]   Did you see, you must have loved this.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.400]   Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the Olympic opening using his NextCUBE.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.960]   He had his NextCUBE out.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   You must have loved it.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   I loved it.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.200]   I had a NextCUBE on my desk just like it.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   Dude.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.800]   When it came across the screen, I just gasped.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.040]   And you know, it was obviously Danny Boyle, the guy who put together the Olympics opening
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.840]   ceremony, recognized how important the World Wide Web was.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.760]   I mean, there was kind of a confused piece after that with involving phony Facebook
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.720]   and pseudo Twitter and dancing.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.920]   But the moment where Tim Berners-Lee is tweeting to the world, "This is for everyone," to me
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.760]   was maybe one of the highlights of the opening ceremony.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.760]   It was really great.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   Another great NextCUBE cameo.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.960]   Have you ever watched True Lies with Schwarzenegger?
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   Love that movie.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   There's an NextCUBE.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.680]   When they scroll, when they pan through the secret layer of the intelligence agency, all
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   NextCUBE.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.280]   Well, now we know we're half the sales one.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.120]   It's a carol coe.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.760]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.600]   So you, did you go to Apple when Apple bought Next?
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.960]   Yeah, I was there for the merger.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.360]   It was an exciting time.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.440]   What were you doing at NextCUBE programming?
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.760]   I was a developer trainer.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   So I go around the world and teach you how to do it.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   You teach what you're doing.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.760]   Same thing.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.760]   Same thing.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   20 years of iPhone programming.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.960]   Well, Alex, you'll vouch for it being the best.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   The training is incredible.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.960]   The books are great.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.880]   And the thing is, even if you don't see yourself as a programmer, what we have found
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.160]   it to be extremely useful for is being able to talk intelligently.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   We were talking about this last week.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   Being able to talk intelligently to programmers.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.400]   So it's a great thing to build your own app, build that stuff.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.960]   If you decide at the end of the book that you're not going to have the time to do that,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   because it's hard.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.760]   You know, there's a lot of work to do.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.560]   You started to devote your life to it.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.040]   Yeah, so you grow a new, a newfound respect for programmers.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.800]   And every time you open a new application, you're like, wow, I can't believe they did
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   that.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.240]   You know, and but at the same time, it like we're developing apps.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.840]   In fact, we're developing apps with a big nerd rant right now.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   Right.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   So yeah, yeah.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.840]   That's cool.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   And so but it allows us to have those conversations and I go, oh, that's easy.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840]   Let's ask them to do that.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.840]   Right.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.440]   And I'm, you know, but and I know what's hard or I have some sense of what's hard.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.600]   It's great when a client knows sort of what's hard and what sort of what's easy as well.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.600]   Right.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.240]   Because big nerd ranch also does contract programming for a lot of different companies.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   Right.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.360]   Well, then I think the first story of the day is probably one of great interest to you
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.280]   all according to the rumor mill and I'm more, I guess, is the one that got this scoop.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.560]   The iPhone five and iPad mini event will be September 12th.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.480]   Is that true or is that just a bad rumor?
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:35.000]   Andy, you've got you've got your thumb to the pulse of the vein that is Cupertino, California.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.720]   What do you think?
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.120]   I can locate it on a map.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.160]   You can narrow it down to San Francisco Bay area.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.440]   So on that basis.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.040]   And I heard about it mostly when the everyone else heard about the September 12th date.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.960]   I checked with some people who can usually give me a quiet thumbs up, thumbs down.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.760]   And now I believe that September 12th is something's going to happen.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.440]   I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's going to be the iPad mini event specifically,
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.320]   but you know, but it looks very good that Apple's going to be doing something on September
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.800]   12th.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   There it is.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.760]   And the release date, according to this rumor, and by the way, I'm more says is from somebody
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.440]   who has previously been reliable.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.440]   No guarantees.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   They're reliable.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.200]   The release date would be September 21st, which is a kind of what we expect a couple
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   of weeks later.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.440]   They see the Apple seems to be now in the, in the, in the track of they will have the
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.360]   announcement event on, on X day during that time, certain like maybe a dozen people or
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.280]   a couple dozen people will be preceded with hardware under embargo for another 10 days.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.000]   So that allows them on the actual release date to have all the coverage, the, or the
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.880]   blessed coverage already set up for it.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.120]   That's interesting.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:48.840]   So that's why the two weeks, maybe, well, I think Andy has confirmed it.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:55.280]   I know he won't say it, but that sounded to me.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.440]   That sounded like about as close to confirmation.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.560]   I'm saying, I'm saying all I'm all I'm saying is that I believe it enough that now I'm sort
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.600]   of now it looks like I'll, I'm going to be seeing if I can get be in San Francisco during
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.960]   that week for an unscheduled unplen for, for a vacation that I happen to have been
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   planning anyway.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.280]   Keep, keep, keep twisting in the wind there, sir.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.280]   I am not going to help you out one bit, but that's good news.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.840]   Is that September's normal though, right?
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.440]   Isn't that what we saw last year?
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   I can't remember.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.920]   He was October last year, but I think it was, was it October?
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   Okay.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.720]   But it's, it's, it is the best time to do it.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.000]   I mean, if you're going to build up a full head of steam for the Christmas season and
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.760]   the seasons and across the, because this is going to be the biggest launch that they've
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.360]   ever had because now they're on all the, the 4s was split up among the networks.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.000]   We have, there's a lot more global, you know, they now in China.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.880]   So they do it across the world in the next, in the first week or two.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.040]   It will be a, I mean, I do believe the big numbers that, that analysts have been.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.280]   Is it a bad idea that it's getting so predictable though?
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.920]   I mean, we can see the, the stock already.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.920]   And hurt the, or not the stock.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.920]   It hurt the, it really results.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.240]   Or down as a result of people thinking, well, it's autumn, there's going to be an iPhone
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.240]   five.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.240]   Let's not buy one now.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.480]   I don't know if it's, if it's because it's a pattern oriented as much as it is that all
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.480]   these rumors were coming out.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.520]   So everyone that's in the know that's going to get that, you know, even Tim Cook, which
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.760]   surprised me in the, in the analyst call, the quarterly earnings call said people are
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.840]   paying attention to the rumors.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.800]   So it sounds as if normal people too are hearing these rumors or at least if gropped
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.560]   the rumors, the rumors are on CNN.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.680]   I mean, the thing is, is that it's, it's, it's what's crazy is it how do, I mean, how
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.920]   do you build a PR machine where you get CNN to talk about your product that hasn't been
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.720]   released for three months before the actual release.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.960]   So I mean, but I was watching CNN and they're talking about these basic rumors of, and they're
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.200]   talking about what's going to be in it.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   And what it might look like.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.840]   And I'm like, this is like, like the morning, like headline news.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.200]   They're, they're talking about it.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   Just it's, it's crazy.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.240]   But it's a bit of a changes for Apple to have, have rumors floating around.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.600]   I mean, there, there are two categories of rumors that you tend to tend to flag.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.000]   One is the stuff that's absolutely uncontrolled and just seems to be circulating organically.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.880]   And then there's the rumor that is being passed on by like the Wall Street Journal where
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.040]   you wonder, okay, is this a bit of, is this Apple trying to get ahead of the rumors by
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.680]   leaking something that they can't support and can't stand by?
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.840]   I'm, I'm sure that if, that if Apple could create a perfect world, they would much rather
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.560]   have everybody and have no idea when something's coming out, no idea what those features are
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.320]   going to be until they can, they're really ready to commit.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.280]   Because as we've seen in products in the past, oftentimes they will add or delete features
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.760]   negotiating with internally up until the very last moment they have to commit to manufacturing.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.120]   So I think they would rather not have people expecting to see a longer screen or in your
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.640]   field communication because that could affect the press about this device once actually
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   released.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.680]   And they decide that no in your field communication does make sense for the next iPhone.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.680]   Well, I think the one, the one advantage though is you also have that vaporware advantage
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.680]   where Apple doesn't have to commit to vaporware.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.080]   They're not, that's what that used to be the big thing that happened, you know, where
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.160]   Microsoft would announce something a year before it was going to be released and sometimes
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.720]   it would never actually come out.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.680]   But I think that Apple has the advantage of having the rumors do all the vaporware for
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.680]   them.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.880]   So people thinking about an Android or thinking that the iPhone 4S is not quite what they
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.960]   want might hang out and just see what the new phone looks like before they commit to
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.520]   anything else.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:18.840]   Henry Blodgett says this yesterday, not that Henry would ever kind of troll for clicks
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.200]   or put any link beta out or anything like that.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.280]   Henry Blodgett, who in fact, I was, there was a good Wall Street Journal article about
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.520]   him and business insider this week about how he's turned that into a really successful,
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.160]   I can't think this at five or six million in uniques a month site basically by creating
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.960]   very controversial content.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.320]   If the eye, this is Henry's article and you know, it's not so far off from what I was
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   saying on Twitter.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.960]   If the iPhone really looks like this, he's referring to these rumored pictures of the
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.200]   iPhone, Apple may be screwed.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.480]   He's saying, and I don't think he's, I, I'm not sure I disagree with him, that this is
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.080]   not different enough.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.520]   It looks so much like the 4s.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:07.160]   Meanwhile Samsung with the Galaxy S3 and others, the Galaxy Note are the HTC one are pushing
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.120]   the envelope so far ahead that Apple's just going to start looking laggard unless they
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.200]   make some big changes.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   You disagree, Andy?
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   I don't know about that.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.600]   I mean, here's the, here's the Galaxy S3 that we won't be talking about off and off
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   for the past month.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.840]   There's nothing really revolutionary looking about this.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.200]   You've got your basic flat screen with a button on the bottom of it.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   Very soon.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.480]   And also, also realize that, I mean, Apple puts so much development into that industrial
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.120]   design and to that signature for the iPhone.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.680]   It's sort of like there's Coke and there's Pepsi.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.920]   Coke believes that their stylistic can design, their stylistic logo design is so valuable
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.640]   to them that they, they spend lots of money in refining it and they never really, really
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.000]   ever actually changed it.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.080]   Whereas Pepsi is like, no, we want to refresh the logo every five years or no just to make
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.200]   people notice our brand more.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.080]   I think Apple is the sort of company that says we designed this phone to look the way it
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080]   does.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.240]   We think it's really great for our purposes.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.680]   We're not going to redesign it just for the purposes of giving a visual reminder to people
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.840]   this is a brand new phone.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.720]   We would like to think that the new features we put into it will remind people that it's
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   a brand new phone.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.640]   Well, it's going to, it's playing catch up to some degree.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.080]   It's going to finally have LTE.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.440]   It'll be kind of the last major phone not to have LTE.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.800]   It's also finally getting a bigger screen, three and a half inches, which a year ago
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.000]   was seemed like the norm is now looking paltry compared to the Galaxy's 4.8 Galaxy Notes
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   5 Plus.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.560]   Yeah, I got to say this is the first year in which I do personally feel as though Apple
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.800]   has to really deliver this with this new phone because all the other phones are out there.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.440]   They pretty much caught up and in many cases really surpassed the iPhone.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.360]   So it really is a case of delivering things to the, to the iPhone platform that have been
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   the Android space for years.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   It's catch up.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.480]   It's all catch up.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.800]   But I think that it's easy to get caught into this, you know, because we're very tech driven
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.680]   and you know, I use a lot of my extra features on my Galaxy 2S, but I still wouldn't, I still
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.520]   wouldn't offer my parents a Galaxy.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.440]   You know, like I don't, I wouldn't put my parents in an ad.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.440]   You know, I have to ask myself.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.120]   I just spend all the time because I get asked on the radio show, which is your parents,
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.520]   which phone, Android or iPhone.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.600]   And I've spent a lot of time in the last few shows discussing it.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.800]   And I know what you're saying.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   Yeah, I just, it's too deep.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.120]   I mean, I just be nervous to get it.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   I have trouble getting to get it.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.360]   I have trouble getting to certain things on an Android.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.240]   You know, like, and the thing is that I get frustrated looking, this isn't working, you
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.680]   know, and, and so I don't find that the Android is not just that, because I'm now spending
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.920]   more and more time on it for a variety of reasons.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.120]   And I, and I like it for in a lot of ways.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.400]   But as I said, I think that when we think about NFC, we think about all those things,
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.720]   those are people on the outer edge.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.960]   That's, there's a 5%, 10%.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.400]   When we're looking at the average person who's going to buy a phone, I think that when you
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.920]   look at the iPhone 5, you're looking at the meat of the market.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:52.360]   I mean, Apple's gone from being the 10%, that the specialty folks use to their, their
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.360]   providing.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.440]   Even Siri, which is, was a big breakthrough for Apple a year ago, has now, Android folks
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.080]   have completely caught up in, in many cases, surpassed even Siri.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.960]   So I'm really feeling like Apple, is Apple going to have something in the new iPhone
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.560]   that will be one of those things that Apple's so good at doing where you go, oh, like Siri,
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.560]   I got to have it.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.000]   But the thing is, is that they can afford to be behind in some ways because of the, because
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.600]   of the UI, because of the, the other stuff that they have, like an affordable.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   I can afford to be antiquated.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.600]   I got to tell you.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.680]   It looks antiquated to us, but it looks simpler than the Android platform.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.400]   But I think that the, the one thing is, is that, is that for me, you know, if they put,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.160]   they put LTE in, I mean, yeah, they should have probably put that in the last one, but
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:36.080]   they put LTE in, I'm going to upgrade because I, because the speed is so much faster than,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.040]   than the 3G that I have now, or the, whatever the 4G BS that, and you look at this in a unique
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.600]   way because you develop apps.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.600]   Sure.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.560]   And by the way, Aaron and big nerd ranch teach Android development as well as iOS.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.840]   So you've hedged your bets there.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.200]   We have.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.320]   And we think that the iPhone iOS is more sophisticated.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.240]   Certainly from a developer's point of view, it's better, isn't it?
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.240]   Definitely.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.360]   And I actually think from a user point of view, it's better as well.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.520]   I think it's more intuitive.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.720]   I think it's more consistent.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.720]   I'd agree with you.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   Although, Android has caught, has started a catch up ice cream sandwiches a big leap
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.720]   forward jelly bean.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.000]   So they're getting closer from, I don't think that they are there from the program's
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.840]   point of view, the primitives and stuff that are available to you in an iOS seem to be
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.840]   better.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.280]   The same app developed on both platforms typically takes longer on Android.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.760]   So I would, so, but that doesn't really answer the market question.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.760]   You know what?
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.760]   It doesn't.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   And in some ways it does though.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.080]   I think because the fit and finish of a lot of the apps on an, on, on the iPhone is better
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.040]   than the Android because a lot of the stuff that you want to do is all built in and they
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.000]   can, that the developers, you can just tell me if I'm running.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.520]   No, no, no, they have, they have large built in pieces that we can.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.880]   They can't either make something usable and reliable.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.600]   I mean, usually customize it to make it extra pretty.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.200]   But when you look at like the Windows phone apps that are coming out, they're just, they're
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   just buggy.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   Even the ones coming from Microsoft are.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.840]   Well, let's not throw a Windows phone into this mix because that's going to 1% of the
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   market.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.480]   That's not exactly what Apple's is.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.960]   It's also another big discussion.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.880]   But, but I do think that whether that's true or not, the big developers who are developing
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.640]   on both platforms take the extra time to make the Android app as close as possible.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.160]   The path is a good example.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.560]   It's not, it's 99% on Android of the 100% on iPhone.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.240]   Ways which is another good example is virtually identical on both platforms.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.320]   So I think admittedly it's harder work for them, but they're putting the time into, to
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.000]   for parity because they realize this is the Android side is huge.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.560]   It's a huge number of devices you can't ignore it.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.040]   There's also the principle that I think that as people who are inside like we are, I mean,
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.320]   rather we really focus on every single detail about what these devices are.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.920]   I think for the most people out there, they really are.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.560]   They're expected to be above a certain line of quality and ease of use and reliability.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.280]   Once you get a product gets above that line, that's not the only consideration anymore.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.720]   And something as simple as gosh, this is a nice big screen.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.480]   It'll be so much easier to read books on this.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.200]   It'll be so much easier to read maps on this.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.440]   Hey, what's that you say that this, this Android phone comes with like free maps and
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.920]   navigation is free for life.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.360]   What was the cost on the iPhone?
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.040]   Well, it costs 30 bucks and plus you'll have to buy a subscription of your, oh God, forget
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   that.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   Well, but that is another area where Apple's playing catch up in the next and iOS 6.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   We'll have that.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.000]   But that, but in every, in everything we've talked about this point, Apple's playing catch
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   up even the retina display, which is so gorgeous on the iPhone.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.880]   This Galaxy S3, maybe not quite as high a DPA, but is very, very close within 20 pixels
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.880]   per inch.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   It's close enough.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.040]   And also that the larger screen makes it a lot easier to type with.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.840]   Yeah, if well, 80 by 80 is awesome.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.960]   Now what about when I switch between the iPhone and this S3 like on an hourly basis for different
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.760]   tasks and now I'm really am finding an annoying to type on the iPhone's on the iPhone's keyboard
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.720]   because the lack of swipe and plus just the smaller targets make me think, oh man, I
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.720]   wish this had a larger screen.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.680]   And here's another big risk and we've talked about this before and I don't want to belabor
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   it.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.360]   But the new connector is yet another little speed bump, but you add a number of speed bumps
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.960]   up and pretty soon people say, well, if I might have to get a new doc, I'm going to
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.400]   you know, the only thing really at this point is lock in is the ecosystem, right?
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   That's right.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.440]   You've got a lot of Android apps or you've bought a lot of iPhone apps.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.880]   You're locked into that or iTunes music.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.000]   I mean, yeah, there's a lot of ways that Apple brings you in.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.920]   If I do iTunes match and replace my music with those unprotected AACs, can I not play
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.600]   that on any platform at this point?
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   I think so.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:27.000]   The bigger problem is this is the subject of the third part of my epic three part mountain
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.800]   line review in the Sun times is that this is when you start to.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:37.080]   Design your workflow around iCloud document thinking that really is a file lock in because
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.120]   those files are not going to be exposed to the file system.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.000]   Not going to be available through any third party app or your first party app to any other
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   platform.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.040]   So if you're going to be using iCloud syncing to to manage your document migration from device
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.240]   to device to device, if you commit to that, then you really are committing to iPhones and
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.000]   iPads for the next couple of years.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.120]   And that's kind of a big consideration as for my work and here, I'm only speaking personally,
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.680]   that's why I'm not going to be switching to iCloud for my documents.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.360]   So I'm going to be sticking to Dropbox chiefly because there's so many times when I need to
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.520]   be using a document on a device that doesn't have an Apple logo on it or I need to share
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.440]   something with somebody who does not necessarily using Mac OS.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.720]   And so lock in is becoming a bigger and bigger problem as the years go by.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.440]   I still think that I think that the issue is like for me, I have the same concerns about
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.040]   using iCloud for a lot of those things and we were pretty heavily committed to Google
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.520]   Docs for a lot of that.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:38.280]   The Google Drive, but the issue is I keep on thinking about the meat of the market, the
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.880]   70% 80% of the market, that where simplicity is all that matters.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.720]   And the fact that it's easy and I can, when I look at it, I look at my parents, my brothers
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.280]   and sisters who are not really, this isn't their business.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:55.200]   And I got my dad an iPad and he uses Flipboard and the web surfing and he watches Netflix
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   and I think that's about it.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.440]   You know, he's very happy with it.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   Like he thinks it's great.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.880]   But it's, but it's not, but I just think he would get, it took me a long time to get
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.480]   him over some of the humps with the iPhone.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.760]   And I don't think, I think if he was an Android, I think he would have just taken it back.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.760]   But to me, that's another point that that indicates that maybe iOS and Mac OS aren't
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.760]   going to be quite as desirable.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.280]   There's a point at which you should stop trying to improve a door handle that you got
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.280]   it.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.800]   You pull it, it opens, it closes, it works great.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.720]   And then you can tell me about how, oh, well, it's great because it's contoured to the hand
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.840]   and the mechanism is designed toward .001 tolerances.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.280]   And we got the guy who designed the latches on the space shuttle to design this.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.760]   And most people are like, when I pull it, does the door open?
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760]   Yes, good.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.760]   Done.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.720]   Actually, Andy, given that the door handle has been around for several hundred years,
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:45.360]   it is about the worst, the door knob, about the worst possible design.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.840]   Because if your hands are slippery, it's round.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.800]   It gives you no information about whether the door goes in or out.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.680]   In fact, it's possible to design a much better door knob.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.800]   I wonder if that stays the way it is for inertia reasons, not because it's the best possible
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   design.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.320]   You know, a lever door knob is a much better design than a round door knob.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.880]   But Andy's point is that inertia is sufficient.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.120]   Yeah, my big point.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.200]   All right, if that's your point, I agree with you.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.520]   And people have been putting up with Microsoft for a decade past the past is prime.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.360]   I mean, you know, I agree with you.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.040]   And that's pure inertia.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.360]   And I'm a different, I am in a different, you, we're all in a different category where
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.120]   we pay so much more attention to this than the average Joe.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.840]   In fact, that's why we're going to have a poll.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.920]   I want to do this more often.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.920]   I love this.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:35.080]   This is something that a guy named Dan Dirk's designed for NSFW is called straw poll.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:44.520]   Straw poll.me and we're going to do one at straw poll.me/1138.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:51.160]   Are you waiting for the iPhone 5?
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.040]   No, the 4s is good enough.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.080]   Yes, it's the phone to own, even though we know nothing about it really.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:02.640]   I'm waiting for my contract renews, so I won't be buying or no, I'm sticking with my Symbian
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.480]   phone.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.160]   I didn't give you an option for an Android phone because you shouldn't be watching this
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.160]   show if you're using an Android phone.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.440]   Blump it in with Symbian.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   Okay.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440]   Symbian.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:21.680]   Symbian.me/Migo/Android/Windowsphone/kin/kin.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.840]   What's nice about this is we can watch these results coming in real time.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   So far, 770.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.240]   Well, never mind.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.040]   I won't give a count because it's going up so fast.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.520]   Isn't this great?
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.400]   By far, 51%.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.400]   Yes, it's the phone to own with 425 votes.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.400]   21%.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.400]   I'm still rocking my Symbian phone.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   Slash Android, slash whatever.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   16%.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.400]   I'm waiting for my contract renews, 11%.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.400]   No, the 4s.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   So that's interesting.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   A lot of people ready to upgrade.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.200]   Do you know they know nothing about it?
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.200]   They know nothing about it.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.920]   But wait, well, I think we know, right?
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.120]   The rumor mill has to be somewhat accurate at this point.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.120]   Maybe not.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.800]   Do you look at people using blackberries just looking at, oh, isn't that quaint?
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   Oh, I do.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   You see it on TV all the time.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   I see it.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.720]   I feel like I'm going to have to talk slowly.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.600]   I feel like I'm watching Wall Street or something.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.600]   It's Michael Douglas.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   What is that?
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.320]   That's the weird thing about-- I've noticed this in the movies that almost never we see
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.280]   anybody using a phone that anybody in the world was using, even at the time that the
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   movie was being filmed.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.200]   I know that-- I tweeted about this and lots of people have helped inform me that, oh,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   well, you do realize that you're not watching this movie live.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   It was filmed a year and a half ago.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   Yes, I know.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.760]   I mean, a year and a half ago, there were iPhones a year and a half ago.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.120]   There aren't people with flip phones out there, but not as many people as you see in
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.120]   the movies.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.600]   You'll see people who make $300,000 a year.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.440]   It's like, hi, I'm a tech mobile.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.680]   Let me answer my phone.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   Wait.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.760]   Let me text you back.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.280]   It's as bad as having an AOL.com address.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.760]   Well, remember that Sony makes a lot of movies, too.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   Right.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   You know, this new Spider-Man movie, it's all Sony.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.320]   Are they carrying Sony phones?
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.320]   These really are cameras.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   That's Sony computers.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   Everything.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.080]   I can understand the computers and the cameras, but the phones come on and nobody's carrying
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.440]   an Xperia phone.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440]   Please.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.080]   Even Spider-Man's not that nuts.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.840]   All right, so we'll let you take the poll.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.840]   We'll give you some time.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   strawpole.me/1138.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   We'll check back.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.040]   We've got 1,000 votes so far, but I'm sure we'll have two or three times that number
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.680]   in a bit.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.800]   And while you're voting, we'll come back.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   We'll talk.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   We've got lots more to talk about.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   Aaron Heligast is here from the big nerd ranch, big nerd ranch.com.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.240]   Me Naco from Chicago Sun Times and the Celestial Waste of Ban with him, Alex Lindsey from the
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.400]   Pixel Core.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.360]   Let's talk a little bit about Ford.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360]   Ford Motor Company.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.680]   They have the same kind of issue, don't they?
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.560]   If you're designing a durable, good, like an automobile, your design cycle now, Ford's
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.560]   really good.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.560]   This is an engineering-driven company.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.480]   One of the reasons I really like being a partner with Ford is that this is a company
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   that focuses on engineering.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.480]   It's from the top down there, CEO, where's that engineer Boeing designed almost all
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.840]   the modern Boeing cockpits, including the 777.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.080]   This guy knows what he's doing.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.440]   It's an engineering-driven company.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.600]   When they look at problems, they solve them with an engineering mind.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.120]   One of the things he did when he came in to run the company was he lowered the amount
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:20.240]   of time it takes from sketch to assembly line for a car, but it's still a year or two or
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.400]   three, I think.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.320]   And people are going to own that car for several years.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.560]   How do you stay up to date?
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.560]   He came up with a great idea and his team.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.240]   I talked to the CTO of Ford a couple of weeks ago, and he was the one who told me about
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.160]   this, his Paul Macarenes.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.160]   It's a platform.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.320]   Think of the car as a platform, like iOS as a platform or Windows as a platform, that
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.320]   you design for.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.280]   So, you want platforms, you don't want to change every three weeks.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.440]   You want it to be a stable, consistent product.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.440]   The car is that.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.080]   We put the sensors in, we put the interface in, and then the API.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.080]   That's the key, right?
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.120]   So, you create a platform and you create a programmer's interface and people can develop
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   for it.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   That's what Ford did.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.120]   They call it AppLink.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   That's their API.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.520]   They just opened a branch, an office in Silicon Valley to encourage developers to come and
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.080]   develop for Ford.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.800]   And this is how you make the car, the vehicle, up to date.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:19.680]   They bring in their new smartphone and that's got software on it that interfaces with the
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.360]   vehicle and you could do so much more.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:29.640]   We've actually written as is traditional in the hardware world, the kind of the perfect
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.360]   reference app for this.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.920]   If you go to Ford.com/technology, you can find out all about it.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.280]   It's designed for the 2012 Ford Focus Electric.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:46.840]   It'll also be part of the energy when that comes out next year, the hybrid electric fusion.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.360]   It's called MyFord Mobile.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.960]   The MyFord Mobile app is so awesome.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.320]   So take a look at the 2012 Ford Focus Electric.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.840]   This is the way to do it.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.840]   Go to a 4 EV certified Ford dealer and bring your smartphone.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.200]   It does work with BlackBerry but also iOS and Android.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.520]   And you can see it in action.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.120]   You could test drive both the app and the car.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.000]   So just things like tells you where the car is, tell you where the nearest charging stations
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.440]   are, the state of charge and the battery.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.040]   Even if it's in the garage and you're in the living room, you could say, "Hey, wait a
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   minute.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.040]   Don't charge now.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   Charge it off peak hours."
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.840]   And it knows what the off peak hours are.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.240]   You could say to it, "Hey, I'm going to be driving tomorrow morning 8 AM.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.880]   Make sure the cabin temperature is a perfect 72 degrees and it'll do that while it's plugged
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.960]   in so it doesn't use up battery power, heating or cooling."
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.200]   You can actually see how much CO2 you save, how much money you've saved by using the Ford
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.360]   Focus Electric.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:43.320]   And there's a MyFord Mobile website where there's leaderboards and you can compete.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.240]   I mean, I just think this is Ford saying, "Look, we're going to give you a platform.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.720]   We're going to give you an API.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.720]   This is what we can do.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.080]   Let's see what you can do."
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.280]   And already we're seeing a lot of apps designed to integrate with Ford Sync in MyFord Touch
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.840]   and soon the Ford Focus Electric.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.080]   2012 Ford Focus Electric.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.640]   It's available at this EV Certified Ford dealer near you.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.840]   And soon the energy and bring your phone when you go to test drive it so you can test drive
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.320]   the MyFord Mobile app to find out more at Ford.com/technology.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:20.400]   Folks are still coming in on our straw poll and it's 51% the phone to own.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.480]   By a large margin, I think the Symbians are just, I think a lot of those Symbians are
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.480]   just a joke.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.600]   Well, I always put the number of things here.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.400]   The fourth choice is always a joke choice.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.800]   That's the secret poll pro tip.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   But still, look at that.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.120]   50, more than half are going to get the iPhone 5.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.480]   And that's what all the analysts are saying.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.280]   So Blodgett probably is full of it.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.600]   It's probably Link Bay when he says, "Ah, nobody's going to buy this phone."
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.080]   It's just what everybody says.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.680]   We have this conversation before every iPhone launch that no one's ever going to buy it
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.720]   because it didn't look enough different or it's not fast enough and it's behind Android
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.640]   and it's all like we hear this and then they sell 50 million phones.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.640]   I thought that got the 4S.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.640]   Remember we thought that about the 4S?
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.640]   Oh, that's a minor upgrade.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.120]   Who's going to buy it just for Siri?
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.640]   It looks exactly the same.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640]   Everybody.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.640]   So we have this company.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   You're right.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.640]   This is a movie I've seen many times.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.640]   It's the 4S as any measure.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.640]   This is...
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   Yeah, that was not exactly looked the same.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   Yes.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.640]   Exactly.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.640]   Which was useful because it meant that all of our cases were all the cases.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   All the cases were.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   That's a big deal.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.640]   That's a big investment to me.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.280]   Like changing the investment, my cases, because I have a lot of batteries.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.280]   It's like...
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.200]   Well, that's why I think the connector is a big deal.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.480]   I don't know why people don't see the connectors a big deal.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.480]   I don't think it's a big deal.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.760]   I think it's a big deal with people who've had...
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.480]   For people like us who've had iPhones for a long, long time, it's going to be a nuisance
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.360]   to have to buy an adapter or to replace what's probably going to be just a $20 cable.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.880]   And then we're just going to shrug and move on.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.840]   Everybody also is just not going to even notice it to be...
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.080]   I guess I'm the idiot who has the $200 clock radio with a 30 pin dock on it.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.080]   I have that too.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:55.120]   I'm the idiot with the Sonos docking station for $139 with a 30 pin connector on it.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.320]   I'm the idiot with 40 30 pin connector cables.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.600]   Excuse me, but I'm the guy who spent all the...
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   How much?
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.000]   I mean, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars on the 30 pin connector.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.680]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.400]   But it's not, by the way, the retina display.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.280]   Everybody can tell me that the new MagSafe adapter, the MagSafe 2 on the retina display,
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.120]   isn't any form or factor better.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.480]   It's worse.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   It's worse.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.880]   Well, I like that they went away from the L because that's a real problem for me.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.040]   No, where is that a problem?
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.040]   The L is right.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.000]   I had a bunch of shell cases that didn't work with this.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Oh, John.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   That's a bad reason.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   So, but I'm just saying.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.160]   So some third party crap app didn't work.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.480]   But this is not an improvement.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.400]   It's bigger, it's thicker, it doesn't have the L. It falls out easier.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   It sticks out too far.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   It sticks out too far.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.640]   I will say that I would have preferred them to just keep the same form factor.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   I don't understand the form factor.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.240]   Well, I guess they had to make it thinner.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.360]   Well, again, because...
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.120]   Because that extra quarter of an inch was that important.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:53.640]   Think of all the benefits we get from that extra quarter inch of thinness that we got
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.640]   on this new MacBook.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.640]   Is it that much?
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.640]   I'm just curious.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.120]   I mean, couldn't this have worked?
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.120]   It is...
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.520]   It's not even a quarter of an inch, Andy.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.520]   I'm talking...
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   It's two millimeters.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.040]   No, I mean, no, I mean, it's a...
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.160]   The Macnew MacBook is about a quarter of an inch thinner.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.160]   Right.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.160]   That's why I had to make all these really big adjustments to make it work.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.160]   But yeah, no, I have a...
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.520]   Mr. Poe wrote about a column today or yesterday about how he can't get the new Macs, they've
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.040]   connected her to stay in.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.960]   I had the exact same problem when I was reviewing it and for the month that I had the never
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.040]   ever threatened a Mac.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.960]   It was like, it's fine so long as you don't move the Mac.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   If you...
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.320]   Mine falls out, if I look at it, funny.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.520]   If I did as much as simply lift it up for about an inch just to move it, someplace else
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.640]   on the desk, it would come right up.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   It's just...
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.640]   It's a failure of design.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.640]   No, no question about it.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.280]   But I guess it didn't stop any of us from buying a retina.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   MacBook.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   I don't like...
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   I'm not...
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.200]   I mean, I said it works for me to some degree.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.800]   I will say that the retina is just for a product professional.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.640]   Best computer ever made...
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.640]   Ever.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.720]   Best computer ever made.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   Hands down.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.920]   I'll tell you, two thunderbolts and next you might out.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.920]   Oh, shut up.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.280]   I am very tempted though to get a thunderbolt 27.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.200]   I'm very tempted.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.840]   There's another $1000 sample that's in my...
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.400]   So now, the other part of this Renee Ritchie rumor in I'more and a tip of the hat to Renee...
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:22.400]   A tip of the cowboy hat to Renee Ritchie is that not only will there be an iPhone...
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.680]   By the way, it's not the five.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.680]   It's just the next iPhone.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.680]   Whatever you do.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.680]   Yes, it's not gonna be a five.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   It's gonna be a new iPhone.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.520]   I doubt very much it'll be a five.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.120]   That there will also be a mini.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.040]   Will there be a mini announced an iPad mini?
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.520]   Will that be... is that... do we?
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.640]   I think our discussion is what price point will be, not whether it's coming out.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.040]   No, it may come out, but that's the wrong time, isn't it?
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.160]   Shouldn't it come out when the iPad comes out?
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.320]   I honestly, at this point, I'm not gonna guess what day it's gonna be released.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.640]   I'm not gonna guess as to what feature set it's gonna have.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.640]   I would be...
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.600]   At this point, I would be a little surprised if we didn't see one released in time for
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   holiday buying.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600]   I guess so.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.480]   I won't be shocked if it doesn't happen either.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.480]   Does that not kill the iPad new sales?
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.480]   No, I think there's some people who are gonna want...
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   There's definitely people who want the bigger iPad.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   What if it's 250 or 300 bucks?
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   I don't think it makes a big impact.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   It probably makes a bigger iPad.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.480]   I don't think that it...
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.280]   That's a straw poll for next week.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.480]   I think that at $199, it's scorched earth.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.680]   It just annihilates the entire tablet market.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.840]   Anything above that, we'll start to drop off and it's effectiveness to do what I think
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.760]   Apple's designing for it.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.320]   I think $199 is the price that Apple needs to figure out a way to come in that to really
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.040]   make it have the impact I think that they want.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.920]   On the other hand, they might want to go above $199 only because that's what everyone else
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   is priced at.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:46.200]   I think that psychologically, if they even priced us at $229, they might be communicating
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.400]   suddenly while ours is a superior problem.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.200]   We don't have two different logos.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   Something about this.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   Does the envelope go full?
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.680]   A 16-gigget to $49, which is pretty much the same as the Nexus, would be competitive as
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   well.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.320]   It's interesting to note that when you talk about Amazon and Google and their solutions,
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.720]   they're subsidizing those because they're hoping to make their money a different way.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:14.000]   Whereas Apple makes their money on a profit margin from the hardware.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.680]   It depends on whose breakdown you believe.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:21.840]   The initial breakdown of the Kindle Fire put it at about $8, $5 profit per unit.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.680]   The latest ones that I've seen as about a month ago put it at actually about $30 to
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.240]   $40 per unit.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.840]   I don't know whether the analysts have just changed their minds or whether Amazon has
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:37.040]   found a cheaper source of certain parts or whatever, but you're absolutely right.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:42.800]   The fact that the Amazon tablet market has to be so heavily subsidized and the fact that
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.360]   Google has to pretty much give away these tablets just to make sure that there's a viable device
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.880]   out there says so a lot about the problems about getting developers interested in targeting
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.920]   that market to begin with.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.280]   By the way, if they do it in September, why don't they just call it an iPod because that's
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.280]   September's iPod launch time.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.280]   Is it an iPhone event?
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:06.360]   It used to be exclusively the iPod, the iTunes event.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.400]   Now they pretty much said that this is going to be a broader iOS event.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:16.280]   We've talked before about how another question and one of the reasons why I'm not making
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.720]   any predictions from now on is that I honestly don't know whether they're going to be calling
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:25.880]   an iPad mini or whether it's going to be an elevated version of the iPod just to put
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.800]   some sort of a class distinction between the two devices.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.840]   I have no idea.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.360]   It's a fascinating topic for bar discussion.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   We're going to move on because I think we've discussed it to the breaking point and we
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.840]   do have something else to talk about.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.880]   A new operating system is here.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.880]   Right.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.880]   Another straw poll.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.400]   I didn't create this one for Matta Jen in our chat room did and thank you Jen for doing
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   this.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.120]   Strophole.me/1159.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.400]   Have you upgraded to Mountain Lion?
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   Yes.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.720]   No, I'm waiting for better app compatibility.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.000]   No, and I don't plan on it.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Of course, I have upgraded and so far we've only got 16 votes, but we just started it.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   We'll take a look.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.040]   We'll let your votes come in and we'll talk about in just a moment.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.880]   I love this straw poll.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.040]   This is waiting for Windows 8 before I make my decision.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.160]   There is no entry for that and it's not allowed.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   I don't know.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   Well, okay.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   We're going to take a break.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.360]   We're going to talk about squarespace.com and we'll see how those poll results are after
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.400]   so you have a minute to vote.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.480]   And then we'll talk about Mountain Lion.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.440]   I'm sure we all have something to say about the new big cat in town.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.080]   But first a word from squarespace.com.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.960]   Everything you need to create an exceptional website and we've got a special deal for you
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   in just a second.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.720]   I'll tell you about this is the new Squarespace.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720]   Woohoo.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.960]   We've been talking about version 6 for how long they've been working on this and I am
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.160]   so in love with it.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.640]   I've been using it for a few months.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.400]   Completely updated code.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   You know what that means Aaron.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.600]   I mean that's a lot.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   Nice.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.600]   Start from scratch.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.120]   50 plus new or improved features.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.800]   You can all watch all the new features if you go to new.squarespace.com.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   Any W.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.160]   I'm going to go there right now.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.040]   New.squarespace.com.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:13.720]   We've got a great video that will show you the whole kit and kaboodle.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.480]   Things like new template designs.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.040]   These are, this is responsive design.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:22.200]   Everybody who does web development knows that that's the kind of the magic term these
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.400]   days.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:29.760]   That means instead of doing a mobile site separate from a desktop site, you do one site.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.440]   One site fits all.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.680]   And that is really sophisticated stuff.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.680]   It's not easy to do.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.560]   It was one of the things that really made this take a while to get going.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.200]   By doing so, you design one site that looks great no matter what the platform.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.540]   Here's the example that they use.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:50.760]   If you upload a picture to squarespace, they literally create nine different thumbnails
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.960]   for depending on how you're going to see it, whether it's on a desktop, 27-inch monitor,
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.280]   or if it's on an iPhone or anything in between.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.520]   They create thumbnails automatically so you get the best resolution for each platform.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.200]   The layout engine makes it so easy.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   Here you go.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   See, look at that.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.200]   Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.640]   On the big one, the little one, the medium one.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.560]   It all looks the same.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:20.440]   They also have this incredible drag and drop layout engine that lets you change everything
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.240]   just by clicking and dragging.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.240]   It's so beautiful.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.480]   Now, this is the design phase, but once you're in there putting in content, it couldn't be
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.760]   better and easier too.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.480]   You've got complete social media accounts and sharing settings, so your Twitter, your
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.200]   Facebook, your LinkedIn, all work.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:41.160]   You can import and export from Tumblr, WordPress, and Bloggers, so you're never stuck in a squarespace
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.960]   site and you're never stuck in your Tim Tumblr WordPress or Bloggers site either.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.760]   You can move around.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.120]   Look at the video and you'll see how slick this is, even embedding Google Maps, things
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.240]   like that.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.920]   The new squarespace is here and we're celebrating.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.960]   One thing I really admire, they did not change the pricing.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.080]   Their simplified pricing is still in effect.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:06.720]   Two plans for $8 a month when you buy yearly, you get the basic plan.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.720]   That's very affordable.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.320]   By the way, this is hosting and the software.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.600]   You're not paying for the software, you're paying for the hosting.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.360]   Software comes along for the ride.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:20.400]   16 bucks a month when you buy the annual plan gives you the amazing unlimited plan.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.680]   I mean, this price, I don't know how they do it.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.560]   16 bucks means you get unlimited pages, galleries, and blogs.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.760]   You get unlimited bandwidth.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   Unlimited.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.600]   Check with any other web hosting company.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.920]   That is a very expensive feature.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.440]   Add to that unlimited storage.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.320]   No limit on the amount of storage your site is granted.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.840]   Unlimited contributors, which makes it very good to do a site with multiple contributors.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.600]   You have custom domains, automatic.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.480]   When you get a yearly plan, they will register it for you, hook it up.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   That's simple.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.600]   If you got a custom site, advanced form builder, Google Apps, MailChimp Sync.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.640]   I don't know what that means, but I'm sure it's good.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.160]   Mailch, is that like mailing list thing, MailChimp?
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.120]   I haven't used MailChimp.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.320]   Published to Facebook pages, 24/7 support always available.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.840]   It is really the best.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.440]   So, I remember I told you I was going to give you a deal.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   Here's a deal.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.440]   Try it free.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.320]   Just go to squarespace.com and press the get started.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.840]   They call it get started button.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.000]   So you get a 14 day free trial.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   You can switch the templates.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.400]   You can play with all the tools.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.000]   You do not give them a credit card.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   You don't need to.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.520]   You don't even need to give them an offer code.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.520]   Just do it.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.400]   It's a great way to make a site and just see if you like what you see.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.760]   If you do and you decide to buy, please do me a favor and use the offer code MACBreak7
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.720]   for the month of July 7th month.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.680]   And you will get 10% off your first purchase.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.200]   That's why it's worth making it the annual purchase to save the most.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.040]   10% off your first purchase when you use MACBreak7.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.800]   Don't forget that free domain registration is thrown in as well.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.400]   Squarespace.com.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.880]   Love it!
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.880]   So far, 390 votes.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.440]   And this confirms what we're already seeing.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   What did Apple say?
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.440]   3 million people in the first day downloaded and installed Mountain Line.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:13.440]   Of our audience, and I would expect the 64% of our mountain.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.000]   20% say waiting for app compatibility.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.680]   Only 16% don't plan to upgrade at all.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.680]   That's crazy.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   I'll say to them slowly.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   They might be here.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.680]   Yeah, you're not going to upgrade.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   I'm not going to upgrade it ever.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   Right.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.560]   I'm going to upgrade one of my smaller machines.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.800]   And it works fine, didn't it?
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   It does work fine.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.240]   So the early tests are good.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.760]   I've been watching the blogs.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.240]   There is a page on Apple's support forums of people having problems.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.600]   But they're really rare.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.600]   It seems to be a very stable, simple upgrade.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.600]   Well, it's not a huge upgrade, right?
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.280]   It's line plus a little bit more.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.280]   It's an incremental step.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   Right.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.280]   Better.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.280]   I don't know.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.280]   It's interesting.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:54.840]   I'm saying, John Syracuse is saying it's a bigger upgrade than Leopard was.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.720]   No, Leopard was for Leopard.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.720]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.240]   You wrote the big, long review on--
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   He wrote the book.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.240]   Sometimes.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.240]   No, Syracuse wrote the three books.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   He wrote the 25,000 words.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   Exactly.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:12.560]   It's a-- I think it's a big thematic upgrade.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.240]   It's not-- there aren't as many big differences--
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.240]   I'm sorry, I know.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.280]   There are just as many big differences between Mountain
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.560]   Line and Line as there were between Line and the previous edition.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:30.040]   I think that it's a thematic upgrade in that this is probably the most in-your-face
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.760]   holistic integration between iOS and macOS we've seen yet.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.520]   The back to the Mac features that we saw last year were mostly things where they're
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.360]   going to take-- they're going to give you an application launcher, but if you never
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.040]   want to use that, you never have to use that.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   And almost every feature that they integrated that way was of that caliber, where if you
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   never want to use multi-touch gestures, you never have to use it.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:57.600]   Now it's hardwired into the operating system where it really-- you can decide not to use
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.320]   the sharing buttons, but you will see the sharing buttons everywhere.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.320]   And you don't have an option of not using the notification manager because that's the
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.480]   way that every standard app now communicates with you when it needs to communicate with
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.480]   you.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.080]   And as I was talking about before about the upgrade in iCloud, it's the-- it's the first
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:19.600]   fundamental change to the document model since 1984, where on the OS level applications
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:23.480]   are the librarians and the managers and the curators of all of your documents, where by
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:29.600]   nature and by default-- excuse me, by its very nature, if you're using iCloud, you don't
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.760]   have any direct access to your documents.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.680]   You always have to go mother may I through your applications.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.640]   So I really do think it is a major, major, major upgrade.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.240]   And also it's a major step forward-- I'm sorry.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.880]   Step on some vector, let's just say forward or backward or sideways, it's up to other
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.800]   people to decide.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:57.880]   And making sure that Apple makes the double walled Apple pleasure dome a little bit more
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.480]   secure and a little bit fancier and a little bit harder to get out of.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.920]   It really is a point which over the next year, you're really going to have to start making
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:10.080]   these decisions about do you want-- is it okay to-- all the advantages of staying within
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.800]   the Apple ecosystem, are they continuing to give you payoffs?
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.840]   Are they going to continue to create advantages?
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.080]   Or are they going to create problems with you later on?
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:22.520]   And the other perspective, which I'm certainly not the most qualified on this panel to discuss,
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.800]   is the limitations that it's-- the difference that Apple's creating in how it relates to
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.320]   developers and third party apps now, where so many of these really cool 10.8 features,
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.000]   you don't-- as a developer, you don't have an option of selling your apps outside of
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   the app store.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.960]   You don't have that choice if you want to support documents in the cloud.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.680]   If you want to support iCloud, you have to be selling through the app store.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.560]   It's not good enough to simply have a developer ID anymore.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:51.680]   So that's why I call it a really major thematic change, where I can't think of 10.8 now without
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.560]   thinking about the double walled Apple pleasure dome, which is what we're moving into.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   And pleasure domes are wonderful places.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.920]   That's why they call it pleasure domes.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:07.240]   I think that this is where we start factoring those larger questions in to the Apple experience
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.720]   now, though.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.320]   Aaron, I know Marco Arment has written-- and a lot of developers have written-- but Marco
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.080]   has written that the app store is history, that it's just not keeping up, that Apple's
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.480]   really got to work on it.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:24.360]   I know a lot of developers didn't like the new entitlements feature.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.760]   I have to say that the security model-- I'm impressed by Gatekeeper.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.320]   I think the entitlements are a reasonable thing to ask you.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.480]   Don't have to participate as a developer.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.680]   You can sell on a website, right?
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.680]   That's right.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.000]   With the developer ID, you can also code sign it.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.440]   And so the default for Gatekeeper is that it will let you start up an application that
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.920]   has been signed by an--
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:50.360]   Although, if you right click or control click and say open, you can open any app.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.600]   Even if your settings are more restrictive.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.520]   Although most users are not aware of that.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.360]   Well, Apple tells you, though, you know.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.360]   That's true.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.360]   It is.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   Which is kind of cool.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.360]   I was really impressed.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.000]   So the default, as soon as you install Mountain Lion, all of a sudden, you're set to the middle
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.760]   setting, which is you can only do apps from the app store or from signed developers,
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   right?
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:14.400]   And of course, the first thing I did is download something from neither.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.840]   Because nobody's got their certificates yet.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.440]   I think it was an update to AlphaApp.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.800]   And it said, well, no, you can't open this because your permissions, however-- and it
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.760]   gave a long paragraph-- but I think if you read it, it said, however, all you have to
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.160]   do is control click on this app and select open.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.560]   And you'll be able to open it this one time.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.320]   You don't have to change your settings forever.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.320]   That's right.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.320]   I like that.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.000]   Now, if Apple hues to that line--
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.160]   I see my concern is that they're going to gradually move to the app store only model.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:46.280]   But if Apple hues to this kind of middle road where they offer flexibility but they encourage
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.840]   security, I think that's a great middle ground.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.280]   Well, there's a couple of different things happening at the same time.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.440]   The first one is you're right.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.200]   They could gradually move it.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:58.560]   But Andy has a point about iCloud is that with the hard drives, the SSD hard drives getting
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:05.040]   so small and all our photos coming off those huge chips being so huge, the iCloud is becoming
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.040]   really central.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.800]   The cloud is becoming very central to everybody's world.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.960]   And to the users, the fact they have iCloud, they want to be able to store that stuff up
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   there.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.760]   And if you wanted your application to integrate with it, you're going to have to sell it through
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.760]   the store.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.240]   And users may have to buy new Macs.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.440]   Because if you have more than a two or three-year-old Mac, you can't either.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.680]   You have to be Lion or Mountain Lion, right?
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.200]   But you have to be Mountain Lion.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.840]   Andy, do you know-- can you do the iCloud thing with Lion only?
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   I think so.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.440]   I think on iCloud, document sharing, I believe requires 10.8.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.440]   Oh, OK.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.680]   Other iCloud itself does not require 10.8.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   But I believe that is an--
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.680]   So Apple is pushing both ends.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   They're pushing users and developers into the future.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.000]   I'm going to double-check that.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.560]   I believe I tested it.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.920]   I couldn't get it to work with 10.7, but I should double-check that.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   That sounds right, actually.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.920]   And that makes Marco nervous.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   But I think he's overstating.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.000]   And I don't think that users are going to turn away from the App Store because of him.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   I'm in Marco's camp.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.560]   In fact, the minute they announced the App Store, I predicted, oh, this is the beginning
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:04.560]   of the end.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.360]   They're going to push us all in this direction, mostly because it's so great.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.360]   Everybody loves it.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.280]   And we're just going to all get suckered in.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.480]   And Apple's just going to finally, at some point, pull the plug in.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.120]   Everybody go, oh, thank you, Apple, for taking care of us.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.240]   I guess I would say that it solves such a big issue, though.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.240]   I mean, because it's just--
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   It does.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   I shudder.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.320]   Every time I update a computer, I shudder at what it's going to take.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.040]   Now, the only apps that I have to install specifically are the ProApp.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.760]   So my Autodesk and my Adobe apps are pretty much the only ones that are left.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.720]   And some 3D apps, Cinema 4D and Moto and stuff like that.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.640]   But outside of that, everything else, I just go--
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.520]   And if you have a little app, I think this is the thing that I've become to a point where
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.560]   I will not-- I mean, I like back off on buying apps.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.320]   If they're a little app, and when I say a little app costs less than $100, and they're
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.800]   not in the App Store, I'm like, oh, that means I'm going to have to deal with the upgrade.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.880]   I'm going to have to find my serial number.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.720]   I'm going to have to--
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:56.720]   You know, all that stuff.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.120]   And I'm like, I don't want to deal with it.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.280]   But from the developer point of view, one of the things that makes us crazy is often you'll
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.680]   ship an app that you know it's going to progress and become valuable over time.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.760]   And the app store does not allow you to charge for paid upgrades.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:10.760]   No paid upgrades.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.560]   And that's really problematic to a small development company.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.240]   Let me just-- let me posit this.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:20.240]   If nothing changes, now we're in a perfect world where you have choice.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   You have security.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.720]   You have a good security model.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.640]   You encourage people to do that.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.840]   They have the option to do that.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.480]   But they're not required to.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.280]   And so, if you have a lot of resources, you can still sell on the online store or rather
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   their own own store.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.920]   And people could still buy-- if nothing changes, would you say this is a perfect world?
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.400]   If nothing changes, this is a perfect world.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   But everything is changing.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.880]   And the other difficulty is that there's a whole lot of pain that we don't get to see
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:50.680]   as users, where developers now have to spend a larger percentage of their time keeping their
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:55.480]   software working, as opposed to investing that same amount of time, adding new features
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.760]   or moving their project forward.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.160]   The transition to 10.8 and the transition to the app store is a really big deal for a
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.480]   lot of these developers.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.840]   And then you have the problems where-- I don't think Apple is being insensitive to the needs
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.720]   of developers necessarily.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:15.120]   But there are so many reports of you submit your app to the app store, and it just takes
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.400]   a long time for it to get processed or it gets kicked back and now you've got a new
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.600]   problem in your hands.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:26.600]   It's a total shift in the relationship between a developer and its users.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.720]   Traditionally, you've had that direct one-to-one relationship.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:37.080]   I mean, it's kind of funny that developers and writers like myself, our jobs have totally
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.680]   switched positions now.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   It used to be that 10 years ago, if I wanted to publish something, I had no alternative
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:48.840]   but to become a columnist for a newspaper or magazine or get my book published through
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:54.200]   a major publisher because they were the gatekeeper that decides what doesn't and doesn't get published
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.760]   and what the people do or don't want.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.880]   Today, I can just simply write whatever I want, click a button and publish it and sell
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.560]   it immediately.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.320]   Developers historically have always had that ability to just make duplicates of their own
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.960]   software onto a five-to-core and floppy, put it in the Ziploc bags and mail it from
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:09.960]   their kitchen table.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   Today, however--
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.520]   Well, ahead of that a little bit.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.520]   Oh, no.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.720]   But I mean, historically, it's always been until I start working for a larger company
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.800]   or until my company gets bought out by another company.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.400]   I will have my own business, which I sell my own software.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.800]   There was a time when you had that same kind of model where you did have to pretty much
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.240]   make sure you got into the eight-head stores, you make sure you got placement in the Mac
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:35.360]   connection catalog, but that kind of came and went pretty quickly enough.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:41.160]   And so today, we're back-- developers are right back at Square that terrible year where
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.560]   they don't-- they're having fewer opportunities to sell directly to customers now because
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.720]   now the trend is to put more and more control in the hands of a central authority that decides
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.920]   whether or not your app has been built to standard and whether or not it's appropriate
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.560]   to be released to users.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.680]   It does feel a little bit like fascism.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   No.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   OK, that's not--
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.680]   That's not or safe.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   That's a hard word.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:09.120]   Well, the different things will just work better if you let us take care of everything.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.400]   But the thing is, it's almost always the case for an Apple user.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.440]   It's rare to find-- when I talk about--
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.520]   I've been talking a lot about-- and complaining a lot about Apple's control over the past
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.800]   several months.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:25.080]   But remember that most of this is academic and just worrying on my part because I do
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.440]   tend to worry about what can happen two or three years from now.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.320]   From a user point of view, it's great to have all your software in one place.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:36.080]   To-- when someone recommends a backgammon game, you don't have to try to do 8 million
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.360]   Google searches to find out which of these 400,000 different sites filling backgammon
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:45.080]   games, including stuff that runs on Mac Basic is the one that was being talked about.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.760]   It's one place that has all your software.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.560]   As Alex said, one place that you can read download all your software.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:56.160]   iCloud never has been easier to move data, to have a life that spans across several different
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.640]   computers and devices.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:02.000]   I don't think that Apple-- I don't think it's anywhere in their top list of priorities
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.960]   to make sure that they tighten their strangle hold on developers and users.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.640]   I do think that they are building-- again, it's a pleasure to them.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.200]   They want to make a happy experience for everybody.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:16.760]   I mean, I keep coming back to a line that I came across in a travel book about how Walt
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:21.680]   Disney's designs for Walt Disney World, which is that he wants-- the Disney wanted you to
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.040]   have such a good time, that he wanted to make it absolutely impossible for you to have a
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.680]   bad time, even if you wanted to have a bad time.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.280]   I know that's true because I have wanted to have a bad time at Disneyland every time
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.280]   I go.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.800]   And I still can't have one.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.360]   I was actually-- I was talking to someone that said, you know, that there's so much
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:40.440]   management of Disney that you-- literally when all those animals pop out and sort of
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.360]   dancing around everything else, that's crowd control.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.160]   They're actually like slowing down the walkthrough either.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:50.200]   Every time I go to Disneyland and there's speakers in the trees and there's actually
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.280]   pine wood scent coming out of an actual pine tree because it's spray there.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.120]   I want to hate it.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.120]   I want to hate it so much.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.320]   It's an ultimate fascism.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.640]   It's really interesting that you said that, Andy, because that's my experience.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:08.000]   I am not kidding when I say, I want to hate Disney and I go there and you just-- gosh darn
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.760]   you can't help but love it.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:11.760]   You can't?
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.760]   No, I think love it.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:18.440]   But I think when we get to get back to Apple and the closed-in system, I think the other
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:23.040]   thing is that we're seeing a mass, a lot of people moving from geeks like us that have
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.840]   been really into this for a long time to people who use their computer every day but
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.360]   in a more casual way.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.960]   So there's more people using the computer.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.040]   There's more people that that becomes part of their life, the more, again, the center
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.440]   mass.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.680]   And they're not using it only when they have to do some word processing.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.400]   They're not doing it only when they have to do things.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.760]   They're using it all the time but it's a much more casual experience but they want
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.520]   that casual experience to be easy.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.000]   And I think that that's what Apple is solving well and what a lot of people aren't solving
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   well.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Apple is not catering to us anymore.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   We might as well just face that.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   It's that with a used-
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.400]   Although, I will say that but this computer, it's the best computer ever used.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.720]   But I mean, if you're not catering to the hardcore production guy, I mean, this laptop
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:03.360]   that I'm using is, I don't know who else would use it or who else would really need it.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   It's got two thunderbolts and an HDMI out.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.360]   But it's, so it's, I wouldn't say they're completely giving that away.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.280]   I noticed the heron is not yet.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.280]   You're still using a 17-inch.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.880]   17-inch, it's easy on the eyes.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:18.280]   I wanted to say one thing about developers and sandboxing and part of it is that we haven't
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.800]   been super disciplined about being tidy with our programs.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   So that's the good thing.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.520]   You would install a printer driver and it would put in a demon that was running all
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.520]   the time in a current home like Sten to.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.520]   Big deal.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.520]   It was no big deal.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.520]   Whereas now you're going to have to check off on that and you're going to ask, wait a
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.120]   second, why is it installing this?
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.760]   I would submit that's not only good for users, that's good for you developers.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.760]   I think so too.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:44.560]   I think developers are going to be a lot more disciplined about what entitlements they have
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.560]   to land.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   And I would rankle at being told by Apple, you can't do a demo version, you can't do
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.880]   paid upgrades, you can't do open source.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.840]   But they're not saying you can't do it, they're just saying you can't do it and be on the app
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.840]   store.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:01.200]   And as long as they don't lock out that third party, as they do on iOS, we have to point
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.200]   out.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.200]   They have already done that.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.240]   On their most successful platforms, they have done it.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:10.120]   And by the way, to back your point, Alex, you don't hear people complain about that
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.880]   on iPhone or iPad at all.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.880]   Developers don't complain because those who make money are doing fine.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.520]   Users don't complain because they never could download third party apps.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:25.080]   And I think that the, when you look at that, that ease of use, I think again, users, when
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.840]   I look at my parents, I don't want them trying to install stuff from the web.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840]   That's the big enough.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   Your parents, you will always say that.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.840]   I know people are saying that but I only app store, only app store.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.840]   Okay.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:38.560]   But I agree with almost everything's being said that most of the decisions that are being
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:43.600]   made by Apple are making things much better and much tighter and a more stable, more attractive
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   platform.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:49.560]   But do you think that Apple would ever advertise a computer by saying it's the sort of computer
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.400]   your parents would use?
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.640]   No, that's not a good selling point.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.920]   Because I mean, it's, but remember, Apple's always said for the rest of us, Apple has
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.880]   always said that this is not a, in the very earliest days when computers were for the
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:06.840]   ultimate nerd who was flipping switches on the front and building and soldering, Apple
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.520]   always said the computer for the rest of us.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.320]   That's not really a departure from what Apple's always said.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   Okay.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.040]   But they, Apple always said, here's to the crazy ones, the square pegs and the round
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.040]   holes.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.000]   This was early on when they really needed to reinvent themselves.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.280]   They decided to reinvent themselves by saying, we are about the 15% of those people out there.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:29.400]   And now if there's something that I worry about it is that they're so focused on the
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.600]   85% that they're making, they could at one point make very mediocre middle of the road
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:40.120]   computers that is fine for most people out there that everybody will, these J. Leno
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:45.720]   computers that everybody will like it enough to tune in, but nobody's going to love it.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.200]   I don't think Apple's at risk of that to you.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.160]   I think they're still making it risk of that.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:54.600]   I think that I take in some ways comparing the Mac OS to J. Leno is worse than calling
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:55.600]   them faster.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.600]   They're back away from that as well.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.600]   You faster.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   But I also think that for app developers, I think that you have to rethink the way, especially
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.920]   with upgrades and so on and so forth.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.600]   I think there's a lot of app developers that I'm starting to see with, especially with
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.480]   the iPhone, where you have lots of in-app purchases.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   So those are things that we can-- OK, we're not going to do everything.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.840]   We're going to give you something free.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.200]   And then if you want to go to the pro version or you want to keep on adding features--
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:19.840]   Could you make that be the analog for upgrades, paid upgrades?
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   Is it in-app upgrade?
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.840]   I would imagine.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.240]   I mean, that's what we're doing on iOS, right?
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.240]   People are making that money right now.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.240]   It's kind of nice.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.840]   If you add a significant feature, from the user's point of view, that's nice.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.560]   I'd have the choice to buy that feature or not.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.880]   And it's something that even if you didn't think about it when you released it, you can
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.120]   do a free update that then sets you up for the new in-app purchase.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.120]   Right.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:45.280]   And then when they pay their money, you throw the switch.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.280]   Exactly.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.840]   So I think it just requires a little bit of creativity.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:54.000]   We were, for a while, we were thinking about building our own compositing application.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.840]   You know, an app that would do something like Shake, because when Shake was getting discontinued,
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.120]   we decided it was too hard.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.600]   But when we were looking at it, one of the things we were looking at is the idea that
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.840]   that would be a platform.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.840]   And then when you want to add plug-ins and features like that, that's free.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.480]   It's a free application.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.720]   And then you start adding features back into it.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.880]   Like if you want the green screen key, or that's $20.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.480]   And if you want something else, and then you build this platform that everyone can work
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.480]   on.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.960]   And so the idea was that our revenue generation was not based on that one-time experience.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.600]   It's like, oh, and everyone could customize what they're paying for.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:29.080]   So there's $3,000 worth of functionality.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.840]   And you'll buy this personal buy $600 over here, and this personal buy $300 over here,
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.960]   and this personal just use the free version and the idea.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.360]   But so to me, the in-app purchase makes total sense.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.200]   Because it's not just that, it could be training.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.040]   It could be more information.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.360]   It could be added resources.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.520]   All of those things could be part of that environment.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   As long as you're not sure-locked.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.480]   As long as you're not sure-locked.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.960]   If you're growl, you're not feeling too hot right now.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.760]   Although, let me say, the notification center, I think, is a huge step forward.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.680]   That's why growl's not feeling so good right now.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680]   Because who's going to use growl?
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.680]   I took growl off.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.680]   That's it on growl.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.680]   It's done.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.880]   Whether you liked growl better or not, it didn't matter.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.880]   It's done.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.520]   And we've been at, because we're an app developer.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.680]   I mean, you know, my other company, David Grosch, is a great, you know, when Apple released
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.360]   it, I mean, I always look at it like there's a time in the sun with Apple.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.840]   Like, I'm going to release something and I'm going to go well and I'm going to enjoy
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.840]   it.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.760]   But when they released a new green screen keyer in motion, it was so good.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.520]   You know, our sales dropped pretty dramatically.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.000]   You know, because before it was so bad, you know, and that was a big chunk, but we knew
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   that we knew what was coming.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   It's like people who wrote Twitter apps.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.360]   If you ride on the back of a giant beast with sharp teeth, you can't complain if the
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.320]   beast decides to turn around and eat you.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.640]   It's just what happens if you're a...
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.920]   Also, I mean, if you're big ideas that I'm going to...
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.560]   We're going to create this new version of a ball where it's round and it's made out of
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.480]   rubber and it bounces.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.360]   It's like you'll have a really great market for the first couple of months, then someone
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.520]   will realize actually we could make those too.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520]   It's a very simple idea.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.520]   It's a natural idea.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.520]   Let's have that in our opinion.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.320]   You just have to accept that.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.840]   And it's foolish.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.640]   There's enough history now in the tech world that we don't...
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.000]   You can no longer say, "Wow, I didn't expect that."
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.080]   And you can't say that would happen.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.680]   I've been expecting a notification center for 10 years now.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.680]   It was about time.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.680]   All right.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.880]   Let's change the subject.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.600]   If you watched the Olympics, if you watched even one minute of the Olympics, you saw the
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.600]   genius.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   I'm a genius.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.960]   3D Forgot His Anniversary.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.320]   He wants to make his wife an eye movie, but we land in 27 minutes.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320]   Look at all this footage.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.320]   It's going to be okay.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.320]   Move this here.
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.880]   So I just drag in our wedding song.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.880]   Yeah, for my tunes.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.880]   What if I wanted to...
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.880]   Please turn off all electronic devices.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.320]   No, we're not going to make it.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320]   We're going to make it.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   Add the CP effect.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.320]   It's very romantic.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.320]   And done.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.320]   Awesome.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.320]   We have two minutes.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.160]   21F is working on a keynote.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.160]   Let's go.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.160]   Let's do this.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.960]   The campaign ever, not Mckish, Ferris Bueller.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.760]   Those are your choices.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.320]   I want a thousand words and ten minutes.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.840]   I have to say that it was very gutsy for Apple to also have that new page on Apple.com.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.800]   The list, the home phone numbers and addresses of every Apple genius.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.800]   Inviting YouTube.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.800]   Thanks, give me a good day.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.800]   I got to point out one thing.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   I got to point out one thing.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   Okay.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.800]   Look closely.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.520]   First of all, the genius is sleeping in his genius t-shirts.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520]   That's the...
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.520]   That's the one.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.400]   Problem number two, he now gets up and he's wearing his badge.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.400]   Okay.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.400]   I don't know.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.480]   You see this syndrome, like where...
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.880]   If off-duty cops and off-duty firefighters do not look like off-duty cops and firefighters,
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.840]   the people who dress that way are the people who have some sort of psychological imbalance
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.000]   where they want...
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.080]   They like the authority that comes with the uniform and they like the...
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.800]   So maybe this is just some guy who's just like cosplaying an Apple genius.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.720]   Because people are like, "Oh, here's a friendly guy who knows who knows about technology."
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:54.200]   Oh no, if you want the cosplay, the best cosplay is this second ad where the guy comes
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.160]   up and says, "I kind of bought a Mac."
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.920]   And Tash, did you see this one?
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.720]   Hey, you're a genius, right?
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.320]   I basically just got a Mac myself.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.080]   Wait, what do you mean basically?
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.080]   Basically, it looks like a Mac.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.480]   Great, and came loaded with all the things.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.480]   Basically...
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.480]   I'm photo...
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.120]   You look like Doc from Back to the Future, basically.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120]   Okay.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.600]   I thought he was like, "I wonder if Dan Castell and Anna had a brother or something?"
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.520]   He looks a little bit like...
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.600]   No.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.000]   I think that's Reverend Jim from Taxi.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   I'm pretty sure.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.640]   No, especially that one frame.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:33.040]   So we got a faux-ferris-bueller and a faux-reverly-gym.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.480]   Laugh knowingly and walk away.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.640]   And then of course, this is the faux genius.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.040]   Being in a bell, huh?
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   No.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.040]   Who sold this to you?
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.040]   He did.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.600]   Said he's basically an Apple genius.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.080]   Now, I have to say, I like these ads, but they...
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.840]   I agree with a lot of people who said Steve Jobs would never have approved them.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840]   They don't feel...
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840]   Well...
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.840]   I don't know why there's a difference.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.840]   All right.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.760]   So number one, let's never let...
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.360]   Use the phrase Steve Jobs and never approve this.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360]   Okay.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.360]   Okay.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.360]   That should be retired.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.960]   But for me, I had problems with it because it's smart in that it reminds people that there
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.120]   are these Apple geniuses in every Apple store where you can take things in and have things
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.640]   fixed or advised for free.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.640]   That's great.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.880]   The bulk of the commercial is...
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.240]   And like, wow, amazing.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.440]   Do you realize that you can actually use music in a video just by...
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.880]   Well, you can do that.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.480]   I've got an Android app that can do that.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.640]   Yes, but you can do a keynote presentation.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.640]   That's interesting.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.880]   And that's something that I've been able to do for many years with Windows.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.400]   You want to try out my Windows 7 laptop?
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   This is actually...
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.400]   I actually...
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.640]   They have mouse support now, you know?
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.240]   I think the audience is different.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.240]   This is my theory.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.240]   Do you remember the...
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.240]   It's only on the Olympics, but...
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.560]   Do you remember the Coke in the Morning ad series?
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.560]   No.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.960]   So in 1988, Coke came out with Coke in the morning and the idea was...
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   Breakfast?
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:54.440]   They had claimed these users and they wanted them to consume more Coke by drinking it in
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.440]   the morning.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.440]   Of course.
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.960]   So, Coke in the morning.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:03.160]   This is trying to get somebody who bought the iPad who doesn't like computers.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:08.920]   They feel like a dummy because every normal person in those commercials is a total dummy,
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   right?
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.040]   They feel like dummies.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.600]   They want to go and sell them a laptop.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.600]   So they are showing this commercial.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.280]   Any dummy can use this laptop.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.440]   They might need the help of the Mac genius, but that person is there to hold your hand.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.440]   All right.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.440]   Well, I think I'm going to...
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.440]   This is a Woody Allen moment.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.240]   Remember when they're standing in line and somebody's talking about Marshall McLuhan.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.480]   He says, "I happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here and you're full of it."
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.680]   I am going to pull in Ken Segal who wrote...
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.760]   Who was one of the people who created the Apple campaigns for Shiot Day.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:45.160]   One of the big guys in his blog, Ken Segal's Observatory says, "This thing is so upsetting
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.320]   and has me talking to myself.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.520]   Ken, you're missing the obvious.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.680]   Clearly these ads are targeted.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.640]   First timer is not for you."
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.280]   Ken says, "And this is directly aimed at you."
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280]   Aaron Heligas.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   Uh-oh.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.760]   That's a seemingly logical defense.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.280]   It's also a horrible one.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.560]   How many great campaigns have you seen that appeal to one target group, but turn off everyone
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560]   else?
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.360]   There's no excuse for a campaign like that.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.200]   Apple's momentum is fueled by the enthusiasm of its core customers.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:13.800]   The last thing it wants is to win new customers at the cost of looking ridiculous to its enthusiastic
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800]   supporters.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   And it does.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.800]   He's right.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800]   He's like, "Coke in the morning was awesome.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   Oh, good morning.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.800]   Not so good."
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.240]   I think that this is squarely aimed at the conversation around cost of ownership.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.880]   So the thing is that what they're really showing is sure you can get a cheaper computer and
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   then you're not going to get any help.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   You know, that guy that sits standing over there helping you, he doesn't know anything
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.880]   about what he's doing.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.400]   You're not really getting what you expected.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.920]   You're not, you know, and we have, you can come to our stores and we can help you get
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.200]   the most out of your computer.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.120]   And, you know, it's not your buying and experience from us and in relationship with Apple.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.600]   I'm not saying necessarily this is a good idea.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.760]   I mean, I find the ads a little annoying.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.760]   My wife laughed at them.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.760]   So she's out there.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.760]   Very fun.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   I think she enjoyed them.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.440]   I think Sagala hits the nail in the head about what my complaint is.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:00.560]   He says, "These spots are actually cast as if they're sitcoms with exaggerated characters
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.480]   like the father to be in Labor Day or the passenger in May Day or the sleazy PC store
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.400]   on our own basically.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.880]   These spots try to make their points through comedy alone with, and this is exactly what
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.880]   I, he's, I couldn't articulate this.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.880]   He did with little sense of authenticity in characters or situations.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.480]   These are sitcoms.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.120]   This is exactly what's bugged me about this.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.960]   And I couldn't put my finger on it, but that's exactly it.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.120]   The thing that usually highlights in Apple commercial is that it has the same sort of
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.640]   simplicity and elegance that you usually see in an Apple product.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.640]   And these do not.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.760]   These look like Windows ads.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:36.880]   I mean, I guess the difference is that I'm used to seeing iPad and Mac, like a Mac, the
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:40.720]   retina Mac ad that simply says, here's the best, this is the best Mac we've ever met.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.720]   Here's made.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.840]   Here's the incredibly super sharp screen.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.320]   Here's how it's trim and wonderful it is.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.320]   Goodbye.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.320]   Please buy one.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.520]   And when they, we want to show the iPad ads, which they're showing you a sort of a parade
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.480]   of about 10 different apps, it shows off the wonderful experience of having an iPad.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.640]   And also the lightest generation, you could tell that the focus is to remind people that
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.880]   this isn't just a game machine.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.960]   This isn't just a knee book reader.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.240]   This really is a new kind of computer.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.640]   The difficulty that I have, I think more than anything else is that I don't know what message
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.240]   Apple is trying to send with this.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.000]   Well, I mean, it's a lot of stuff in our in our chat room.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   A.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.080]   Rugy, I think, hit it on the hell and the head.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.000]   He said these look like Dell ads.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   They really do.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   They do.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   They do.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.160]   I said, as an as an now, we're buying a deal.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.840]   Worse, even worse than fascist or J. Leno.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:35.560]   John Louis, guess a former head of Apple, head of Macintosh, tweeted when the ads came
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.920]   out and he did this in a French action.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920]   Ouch.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.760]   Cringing, inducing new Apple genius ads for Mac.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.760]   Ouch.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.680]   And as I said, I do agree that the issue is is for folks like us, I find that one to
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.280]   I find them to be a bit condescending, a bit, you know, all these other things.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.360]   I will, but as I really thought about them, watching them a couple times is that this
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.240]   is also aimed at bringing people back into the Apple store.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.000]   When you come back into the Apple store for a genius ad, I mean, for a genius, you're
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.600]   now in their sale, you know, their point of sale, kind of going towards what Aaron was
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.200]   talking about is you're not bringing them back into a position where they can buy.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.920]   And we have to remember that the Apple stores are the most profitable stores per square
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:11.920]   foot in the world.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.560]   And so, you know,
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.120]   And the genius is really genius.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:18.520]   It is no question that and I talk to normal people all the time who say, Oh yeah, I'm
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:22.080]   getting one on one or no, I'm going to, I'm going to go to the Apple store and get some
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.080]   help.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:28.440]   There really is they have created somehow that notion in the world that you go to an Apple
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.600]   store and there's somebody nice, communicative and helpful there.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.480]   That is something that no other PC manufacturer is master.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.480]   And you look at the design of it.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.760]   I was in the Sydney store a couple weeks ago and, you know, you have to go through two
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.400]   stories of sales before you get to the third story, which is this gorgeous Apple genius
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.400]   location, you know, where of course, how do you get back out without buying something?
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   I mean, you know, that's, you know, in case you're wondering, I didn't find that doable.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.560]   This is not the guy though, to have as a genius, frankly, you think?
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.320]   I mean, that's not what I don't know.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.400]   I just, it didn't seem like much of a genius.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:02.400]   He seems nice.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.400]   He seems nice.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.400]   He's nice kid.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.400]   He doesn't judge.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.400]   He doesn't judge you.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.640]   He just simply wants to be there to help.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.840]   So I think he's a fine ambassador for the Apple genius for it.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   It's not important.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.760]   It's not the end of the world, but it's a good conversation.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.360]   I think, I think just like the Mac versus PC ads, you know, this is really good.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:23.040]   You're taking a soft point in the PC sales market where, you know, you don't get any
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.280]   support and once you buy it, you're kind of on your own for the most part.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.440]   And this is going to take a soft point.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.600]   It's going to take a little metal, you know, stick and just shove it right in there, you
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.360]   know, and the people are going to think about, "Oh, I'm not going to get any help."
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.360]   You know, and I think that's what it's really aimed at.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.960]   I think it's no John Hodgman just in long.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.960]   No, I don't think so either.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.800]   I don't think the quality of the ads and the stature of the ad is anywhere near what
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.800]   we're used to.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.800]   It's a sicko.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.600]   I guess all it'll say is this, the fact that we're debating what these things are about,
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.960]   I think that kind of suggests that it was a suboptimal commercial.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.640]   Suboptimal, that's good enough.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.560]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.440]   We have asked Aaron to do an iOS tip.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.440]   He shook his head.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.440]   No, no, no.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.120]   I'm going to ask again.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.680]   We'll give you another chance.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:09.680]   But if not- I'm ready.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.680]   Are you ready?
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.680]   All right.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.960]   And would you like to do, you know, be fun to do a mountain lion tip?
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   I have a mountain lion tip.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.880]   All right, now we're cooking with gas.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.520]   And we'll have other picks as well.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.960]   But first to word, from a very important sponsor, audible.com.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:26.960]   Loveaudible.com.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:30.640]   Just got a bunch of new books.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.640]   I have a subscription.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:36.120]   And by the way, this is the best way to be an audible listener because not only do you
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.880]   get the book a month, but you, you know, as part of your subscription, you can also
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.360]   subscribe to, I think, is it the Wall Street Journal, New York Times?
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.240]   There's a variety of daily periodicals you can also get.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:50.480]   And what a great way to get your news while you're driving to work or walking on the treadmill.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:57.120]   Audible.com, over a hundred thousand books, but also newspapers, magazines, radio shows,
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.680]   all sorts of stuff.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.320]   Yes, 50 Shades of Grey 2.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:08.200]   I don't know if our audience is the 50 Shades of Grey audience, but maybe it is, you know.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.160]   Spank me, she cried.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.200]   Be and dominate be the way that only you can.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   Do you want to?
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.200]   I'm not.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.200]   Afterful.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.040]   Again, this isn't named at me or anybody on this panel, but I'll just play for you a
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.440]   little bit of 50 Shades of Grey, the audible version, just so you can see here how it
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.440]   sounds.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.960]   The narrator, E.L. James the author, but the narrator, Becca Batto is a, is, and this
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.240]   is, Audible often does this, they have very good narrators.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:40.120]   And if the story is in first person, the narrator will be the same kind of person, right?
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:45.240]   So the narrator, 50 Shades of Grey, is a young woman, a young, I don't know, 20 something,
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.240]   a woman.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.000]   And the narrator is, as well, listen.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.840]   By the way, I couldn't listen to more than a few minutes of this, but if you're in the
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.720]   market for this.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.000]   My heart is pounding.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.920]   The elevator arrives on the first floor and I scramble out as soon as the door slide open.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.400]   Oh, by the way, a little scene center here.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.480]   So she's a young lady.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:12.280]   He's in love with Christian Gray, he's a wealthy, distinguished man, and he has just kissed
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.480]   her unexpectedly for the first time in the elevator.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.600]   Apparently not, sprawling onto the immaculate sandstone floor.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:27.040]   I race for the wide glass doors and suddenly I'm free in the bracing, cleansing, damp air
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.040]   of Seattle.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:31.000]   Raising like this, I welcome the cool, refreshing way.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   It's like a very entertaining Brussels project.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   It's okay, I gotta get this done.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.720]   But first now, somebody I know very well, listened to the audiobook of this and loved
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.120]   it, right?
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.120]   No.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.120]   Right.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.360]   I think it's not for us.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.000]   It's for the distaff side.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.640]   But there are plenty of other wonderful choices if you go to audible.com and take a look.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.640]   So many great books.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:58.440]   That is currently the number one bestseller on Audible.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:04.240]   But in fact, number three is 50 Shades Darker, book two, number five is 50 Shades Free, book
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.880]   three.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.120]   The Hunger Games is on there.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.320]   But there's so many great things.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.320]   I just downloaded.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.400]   I am going to start listening to the Alan First novels.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.480]   These are really wonderful.
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.040]   Their historical novels take place during World War II, kind of spy novels.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.800]   They call it the Night Soldiers series.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.400]   So I got the first one, Night Soldiers.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.400]   But it turns out you can read any of these by themselves.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.120]   They're wonderful.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:37.120]   He is the master of the historical spy novel, which is a genre I happen to love.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.320]   Andy, what are you listening to right now?
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:44.280]   I had one of those that one of the best things I can say about audiobooks is that I had that
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:48.920]   depressing moment today where I'm nearly at the end of the big year, which was my pick
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.840]   last week, a couple of weeks ago.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.640]   And I really, and it's a story that's told chronologically.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.440]   And I'm enjoying the story about these people going out birding on Christmas day.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.640]   And I'm like, oh, that's a fun.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.520]   Oh, that means it's nearly the end of the year.
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.280]   Oh, the book's going to be over soon.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.880]   Oh, don't you hate that?
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.360]   I'm almost at the end of the stand.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.920]   I'm literally thinking, oh, man, not now.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:07.920]   I'm not one of them.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.520]   Why don't we do it until I find another audiobook that I really, really enjoy?
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.720]   Why does Andy not go?
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.280]   He's get the fuzzy under the lollipop.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.320]   Well, I'm sure you have something queued up.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:22.280]   I have as coincidentally something that ties in really well with, but you just recommended.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.440]   I discovered this just this morning.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.920]   On my way back now that I'm looking for my next book.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:36.720]   And oh boy, one of my best favorite audiobooks ever by Ben McIntyre was Project Minzmeet,
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:42.520]   which is the story of World War II espionage story about when Allied spies decided to take
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:50.560]   a corpse, dress them up like a downed RAF with secret documents that would hopefully
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.760]   trip the, they would leave it in the ocean, would wash up on the shore where they knew
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.240]   the German spies were.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:58.760]   And hopefully they would find it and they would believe that this was a pop secret courier
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.960]   with planned, great, great book.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.480]   The same author has come up with a brand new book this week called Double Cross, The
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.720]   True Story of the D-Day Spies.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.720]   Ooh.
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.040]   And it casts a wider net.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.880]   This is all about the counterintelligence operations that are happening from the Allied
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:20.880]   point of view to basically trick, trick the Nazis and the Germans into thinking that the
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.240]   D-Day invasion was happening someplace else entirely.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:26.120]   Now, there is a James Patterson novel, the same name.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.120]   Don't get fooled by this.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.120]   This is Phillips.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.120]   This is by Ben McIntyre.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.840]   Is this the one from the crazy Portuguese guy?
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:37.440]   It includes stories that I did, but usually before I actually click the button and buy
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.480]   one of these audiobooks, if I haven't, if I'm not familiar with it, I'll read a couple
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:47.200]   of reviews and oh man, just these 800 word reviews talking about how their plans involved,
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:52.560]   they successfully turned every single secret agent that the Germans put in London.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:57.720]   And chiefly because none of these agents, they did a bad job of selecting them.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:02.040]   Almost to a man when they landed here, they went immediately to the British embassy saying,
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.440]   "Hi, I'm a German spy.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.600]   I very much like to be a double agent."
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.600]   Because-
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:09.680]   I can see it's not going well for you right now.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:10.680]   Exactly.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.880]   So this is all about how they're managing all this information.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:20.440]   All these people who were, the idea that if you've been chosen as a spy, you're probably
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.200]   at least 30% crackpot to begin with.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.800]   So the idea of managing these people into effectively providing counterintelligence to
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.840]   the enemy was a big problem.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:36.880]   Also you have the problem of having to convince allied generals that we need you to start boasting
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.960]   about where you're going to be landing troops, but do it in such a way that it's subtle.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.480]   But meanwhile, these are generals who are used to being hams.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:48.200]   And then you get these stories about, again, these just for the reviews, you can tell how
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:53.600]   excited about it, about how the person that they really needed to convince was this German
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:00.960]   general who hated Hitler, who actually in a way decided that, look, we could either lose
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.120]   so that we never have a Germany ever again, or if we lose really, really quickly, maybe
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.920]   they'll let us have Germany again in five or six years.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.160]   Let's see if we can lose really, really quickly.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.160]   Wow.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.920]   So the audiobook is about 12 hours, 39 minutes.
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:19.360]   And now I'm like, oh boy, I'm almost done with the big year because now I can start listening
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.360]   to double crust.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.360]   That's the psychology of Audible.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.960]   That's why Audible's so great.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.160]   You get engaged by these books.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.520]   Andy and I are both fans of history.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.040]   So is Paul Therrot.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.400]   And I don't have enough time.
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.200]   I don't know about you to read history books.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.880]   I mean, I've got barely got enough time to read this stuff.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.480]   I have to read for work.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:40.120]   So it's wonderful to have something on your iPod or your iPhone or your Kindle or it
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.680]   plays on almost everything.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:46.080]   Or Android or Blackberry or Windows phones that when you're in the car and you know,
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.520]   you're stuck there because you got a commute for a couple of hours or you're on the treadmill
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.640]   or you walk the dog or doing the dishes that you can do that pleasure reading that you
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.440]   just don't get to do otherwise.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.840]   Do you find you drive slower?
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.840]   Oh yeah.
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:58.840]   I do.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.440]   I'm like, oh, I don't have enough time to finish this chapter.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.880]   It's just fantastic.
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.880]   So this is the book.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:04.880]   It's Ben McIntyre.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.920]   There are about 80 books called double crust, unfortunately, on Audible.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.480]   The Truest double cross, the true story of the D-Day spies.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.360]   You know, I read Operation Mincemeat on your recommendation, Andy, and I loved it.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:18.720]   I had read The Man Without a Name, right, which was the novelized or just kind of the
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.720]   broader history of it.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.000]   So to read the back story was great.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.640]   It's just it's endless.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.880]   You know, I mean, look at this one.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.880]   Comedy in the 70s.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.560]   I mean, you could just go on and on and on and on and on.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.480]   This is an amazing thing.
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:35.000]   I just am a huge fan of Audible and I know you will be too.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Here's the deal.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.280]   You sign up for the gold account.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.000]   That's the Book of Month account I mentioned.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.720]   Your first month's free, your first credit is free.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:46.800]   You can cancel at any time and pay nothing if you want and the book will be yours to
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.480]   keep forever.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.880]   I know you won't because it is so fantastic.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:55.760]   And don't forget if, you know, there's a holiday coming up or a birthday and you want
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.680]   to give a gift, you can also give Audible as a gift.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.000]   And it's a great, most welcome gift.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.880]   So there's a gift center right there at audible.com to find out more.
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:06.560]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.240]   And I see Aaron nodding.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.440]   I see Andy nodding.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.440]   I see Alex nodding.
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.440]   We're all of us.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.440]   Absolutely.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.440]   It's really kind of an amazing success story, really.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.440]   Really?
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.440]   All right.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.280]   Do you really, would you like to do an iOS tip?
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.280]   You can.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.640]   No, I have a suggestion for more general hints.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.640]   Okay, save that.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:26.640]   I will.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:27.640]   iOS tip from Alex Lindsay.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.680]   So if you're like me a lot of times, you don't get connected for a long period of time
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:34.600]   and you come back and there's like 53 applications to update on your iPhone.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.600]   You're like, "Oh, right."
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.600]   You're ignoring it.
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.120]   That number's slowly been going up.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:41.280]   And you know that you want to update, you know, whatever, one of them.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.120]   So I want to update my Audible or field runners or whatever.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.000]   And I hit update all.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.080]   And now it's just randomly, it feels like it's just randomly updating the out of order
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.200]   or whatever is doing, whatever is doing.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.880]   And so if you have time, you leave it there and you go hang out.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:59.880]   But sometimes I just want this one app to upload and finish.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   How can I force that?
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.960]   You can force it by clicking on it and it'll pause it.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.040]   And again, that'll be the next one that's uploaded.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.520]   So you can actually prioritize your uploads if there's certain applications that you want
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.480]   to have uploaded next.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:14.520]   You can actually just pause them and start them and they will be the next application
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.520]   that's uploaded.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.520]   That's a great tip.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.520]   Very useful.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.520]   That's my tip.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.560]   Andy and I go, "How about a mountain lion tip?"
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:27.960]   This is one of the most eagerly awaited features ever since Lion was introduced.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:33.160]   And they went down to a versioning where you lost the save as option in the file menu
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.200]   where you're working on a document.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:39.720]   You want to create a brand new copy of this document and work on this document from this
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.720]   point forward.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:46.600]   "Mountain Lion did not restore this feature, but it is a hidden trick where if you hold
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:51.280]   down the option key and then click on the file menu, suddenly you see a brand new save
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.600]   as command that works.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.600]   Save as is back."
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.000]   Save as is back.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.160]   There's also keyboard shortcut option command.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:03.160]   We'll also give you the save as command.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:08.760]   Of all the great features that are in mountain lion, that's one of the ones that I really,
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.920]   really am glad is back again.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.520]   I missed I missed save as.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.080]   That was the one thing I think people really complain about in that line.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.080]   Good.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.080]   So hold the option key.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.080]   It's there.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.080]   They didn't get rid of it.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   They just hit it.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.280]   Just hit it a little bit.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.280]   All right.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.640]   Now it's time for our picks there in Hillagas.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.080]   Why don't you start us off?
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.080]   In perspective.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.080]   Yes.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:32.760]   So I have moved to an SSD drive, which I love.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:37.540]   The performance is incredible, but it's so much smaller than my spinning hard drive
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:42.840]   used to be, that I'm always dealing with getting things down reasonable size.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:47.600]   And programmers always say, "Do not optimize until you measure it," because you often think
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:51.000]   you're optimizing the problem when you're not really making it worse.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.560]   And grand perspective lets me look at what's really creating the problem.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.360]   It is an open source project.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.760]   It's free.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.160]   There is a donation link there.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.160]   Please donate to the project.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:05.800]   But it lets you actually see things in a graphical way, gives you an idea of what the big problems
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.200]   on your hard drive are.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.600]   This is such an awesome app.
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.840]   And it's been out for a while.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:10.840]   It's been a long time.
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.360]   And I'm glad they're keeping it up to date.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.360]   So it still works.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.360]   Works grand?
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.520]   It's free because it's on SourceForge.
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.520]   It's open source.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:21.640]   Grand perspective without an E. SourceForge.net, which is kind of a weird thing because it is
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:31.640]   grand perspective with an E. But I guess it's too long for the URL.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   Good tip.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.640]   Really a useful tool.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.640]   Thank you for the recommendation.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:36.640]   Alex?
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.400]   So I have not another stop with the load.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:46.640]   I spent the entire week playing that stupid load runners, whatever the hell.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.640]   Field runners.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.640]   God, I'm going to kill you.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:49.640]   I'll kill you.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:51.640]   Yes.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.640]   Can't stop playing.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.640]   I'm trying to watch the Olympics last night.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.640]   And I go, what?
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.640]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.640]   I can't.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.640]   I got to play the road.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.640]   What is it called?
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.640]   Rate about it.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:00.640]   Field runners too.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:01.640]   It's amazing.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.640]   So sorry.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.520]   This one will be easier because it's a little bit of a-- so I have-- I want to show something
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.160]   that is-- ooh.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:12.080]   So do we have an over the shoulder for-- you'll have to hand it.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.080]   That's fine.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.880]   So this is Tai Chi in 3D.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880]   You know?
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.880]   So--
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880]   Is that your name?
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.880]   Tai Chi.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880]   I don't know what our name is.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.920]   So the interesting thing here is they motion captured, obviously, someone who's in Tai Chi.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.560]   And I will say as someone who does motion capture, the motion capture isn't perfect.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.920]   I mean, the cleanup isn't perfect.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.160]   There's some joint pops and stuff like that.
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.760]   But-- so you can see it there.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.160]   But-- go ahead and scroll around.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.320]   It's not just a video.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.640]   So this is a real time 3D.
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.960]   And so what I'm more interested in as far as recommending this--
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.000]   Is this to show you how to do Tai Chi?
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.680]   This is to show you how to do-- try to go through the forms.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:48.000]   And I think that there is a huge industry that's coming when it comes to our iPads and
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.920]   our iPhones of being able to learn how to do lots of different things and being able
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.960]   to get this-- we've been-- the reason that I have a motion capture system is so that
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.280]   we can get good at doing stuff like this.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.760]   I always wanted to learn martial arts at home.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   And the problem is those photos--
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.560]   Well, they do the Commissutrin 3D.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.120]   And you're really in a zone today.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.120]   So yeah.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:11.240]   But anyway, it's a great way if you want to learn how to do Tai Chi.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:16.040]   But I think that, again, a lot of this is just a point to the future of learning, where
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:21.920]   we were able to learn how to do-- whether it's martial arts or Tai Chi or a variety of other--
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:27.080]   you could imagine a lot of different sports techniques and everything else-- it's a great
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.520]   way to get that real time.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.120]   And it just shows you what an iPhone or iPad can do.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.440]   This is a pretty good level setup.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:37.200]   So anyway, that's my recommendation is Tai Chi 3D.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.200]   Really cool.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:42.160]   And the only other thing I wanted to do is I've been in this research mode of headphones.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.160]   I'm just going to get this over.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.160]   Now, those are the Atomotos.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.040]   You recommended the ER7s before they're really good.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.040]   Yeah, I think that--
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040]   And here's the thing.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.040]   I've gone through the process of buying five of them.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.880]   Lisa and I were just talking about this because you burn through them.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880]   They break.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.880]   And they're very expensive.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.880]   I wash them.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   That's my problem.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   So I bought five different ones.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:04.440]   So when I buy different headphones to see if I really like these Atomotos, and I will
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440]   say that I've come back to--
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440]   They're the best.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.440]   --these are the best.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:08.440]   These are the best.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:09.440]   These are the motor-- these Atomotos.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.360]   Now, what I will say is the base response isn't as good as some of the other ones.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.360]   But I think it's more natural.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:19.960]   The base and ability, if I'm going to use it for my phone, these are way more listenable.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:23.720]   Even though my base response isn't as good as some of the other ones that are made, when
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.640]   there's a high base response, it's really hard to understand what people are saying.
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.640]   So it actually makes it easier to use them really as something that I'm going to--
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.000]   These are the HF2s or HF3s.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.320]   I think I have the HF3s.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320]   And the--
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320]   Hey, good news.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.320]   Under $200.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320]   Right.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.320]   Right.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.320]   Well, $199.99.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.000]   The microphone is the right distance.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.920]   So a lot of them are way too low, too far away, and everything else.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:51.840]   They really stick into your ear, which is important to me.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.840]   So--
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.640]   I will not get on a headset without these headphones.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.640]   I mean, I'm an airplane without these headphones.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.240]   This is kind of a repeat recommendation.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:59.800]   I didn't want to make my own recommendations.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.160]   I've talked about them before.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.680]   But I went through this whole journey through the wilderness for 40 years of other headphones
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.520]   to see if this was really the best.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.920]   And I've come back to-- I think these are really the best ones out there.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.880]   One actually pro tip, because Lisa says, "One ear keeps going out."
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:19.560]   And they come with a little weird screwdriver and little weird filter.
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.040]   It's a huge feature.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:26.320]   So when your ear wax plugs it up, as it will with any headphone you put in ear, you use
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.320]   a little screwdriver.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.320]   You pull out the old filter, you put it in the new one, and it's good as new.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.680]   Most of the times, that's what's wrong.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.200]   And most of the time, that's the end of your other headsets, because they have the real
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.760]   big opening and everything else.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:36.760]   And you put them in there.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.360]   They clog up, and there's no good way to really clean them.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.000]   And I used to complain about them.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.600]   I was thinking about these edimotics because they did that.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.400]   And then I learned, "Oh, no, that's not a bug.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.040]   That's why you want it."
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.360]   And you order them, they're nothing.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.040]   It's like $6 for five of them or ten of them, whatever.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:55.240]   I keep a little bag in there, and it takes just a second to pop a new one in.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.480]   And it's a huge feature over some of the other ones, because the other ones, they just fill
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.640]   up with ear wax, and then you're done.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.640]   I agree.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:07.160]   So I get usually three months, four months before the sound starts to diminish in one
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.600]   ear, and then you just replace it.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.600]   Good tip.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.800]   Andy, and I quote, "You're tip of the week."
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.200]   This is sort of a narrow recommendation.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:20.700]   If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and/or really bad movies, you are familiar
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:23.840]   with a movie called "Monos the Hands of Fate."
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.240]   And now it's an eight-bit movie, by the way.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:35.280]   Now it's a Nintendo-style video game that's set inside the "Monos First."
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.680]   Sorry about the pixelation.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:40.800]   I was downloading something earlier to get something working.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:51.520]   But yes, it is the typical, like a Super Nintendo-style jump-collect coins.
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.760]   You do get to meet Torgo, you do get to meet the bots.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:30:04.800]   I hope this was a licensed production, because in any event, it reminds you of two things,
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.040]   number one, that nostalgia is a powerful motivator.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:11.640]   This company got $1.99 out of me.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.760]   My rich are the fact that, although I'm not like a huge, huge gamer, the fact that I could
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:20.640]   now, there is a game based on "Monos the Hands of Fate," and I could own it for $1.99.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:23.600]   That got the two bucks out of me.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.800]   And also, I like this kind of retro gaming.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.360]   I like these simple side-scrollers where I'm not going to be spending three days of my
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:34.920]   life trying to figure out how to pick up and swing an axe, and then the next five days
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.680]   trying to figure out, "Okay, I can swing it now.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.960]   How do I not get killed while swinging this thing?"
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:42.080]   You already know how to play this game in your sleep is what you say.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.080]   You know how to play it.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:48.160]   A lot of it is just going to be simple puzzles of, "How do I get past the snakes?"
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.920]   And how do I manage to duck the...
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:54.760]   On the first level, it ends with there are two people in a car smooching and throwing
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.880]   beer bottles, but not really caring whether they hit you or not.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:01.760]   And if you get past that, then you get to actually meet Torgo.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:02.760]   So...
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:08.760]   Bill Corbett of Riff Tracks in Mystery Science Theater 3000 says, "This game will be bigger
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:11.040]   than Skyrim."
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.040]   Enough said.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.040]   There you go.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.440]   I want to download this.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.440]   I pat in the iPhone.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:19.720]   By the way, John, our studio engineer has another pick to add to this.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:25.520]   The Riff doing it live and broadcasting it to theaters across the country.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.400]   Yes, they found...
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:35.440]   Some guy actually found either the original camera negative or the original camera positive
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.080]   of manos.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:41.240]   So it has never existed in anything other than really, really scratchy, Baffed Up 16
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.320]   millimeter prints.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:48.880]   And so he was restoring it shot for shot for shot in full like 70 millimeter avatar style
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:54.840]   glory, which means that even Hitler had a dog that loved him.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.680]   It's the same way.
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.160]   There are still people who even love manos that hands a fade.
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.560]   Well, apparently.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.680]   I got a couple of things I want to talk about.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:04.640]   First of all, we did mention this at the beginning.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.600]   Of course, Andy's got his great review on the Chicago Sun Times of Mountain Lion, but
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.640]   the definitive review, John Syracuse, does this every year now.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.560]   Poor guy, he's now got to literally do it every year.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.320]   Once you develop that expectation.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.080]   Twenty-five thousand words.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.240]   He'd life has been unreliable.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.200]   And I have to say, he's done a good job.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.120]   Once again, it's on ours, Technica.net.
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:30.040]   If you're an ours pro subscriber, which I am, you can get a full PDF of the whole thing,
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.560]   which is right here.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:37.040]   This is just, I mean, it's a must read reference, right?
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.040]   Lots of good stuff.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.440]   And you'll find lots of tips in here.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:44.200]   I don't know why there's a whole page on the chess game.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.720]   And you might recognize this, Aaron, because this is in fact the same one that came with
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:48.720]   the next cube.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.920]   Now it has Game Center integration in it.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.400]   Game Center is part of Mountain Lion.
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:56.560]   So it's very exciting step forward for the chess.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.560]   And they hide it, by the way.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.360]   It's in like a weird folder.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.520]   So it's still there.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.160]   That's the good news.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.960]   Okay, that's tip number one.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:12.320]   Tip number two, I did mention, last week of the week before Lion Tweaks app, that I found
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.320]   very useful.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.400]   Now the same guy has made it for Mountain Lion.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:19.920]   So if you want to remove, this is the single best reason to buy it, it's free.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.640]   He's asking for a $3 PayPal donation, which I would give him.
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:28.880]   If you want to remove the skeuomorphic leather stitching on I Caller the Address book, there's
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:29.880]   a button for that.
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.440]   And it's in Mountain Tweaks.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.640]   He also has single button things like put the library folder back and stuff like that.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.640]   What if you like the leather?
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.040]   You don't have to push that button.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.960]   It doesn't force you to do anything.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.360]   Can we still have the new car leather smell?
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.800]   That no one has figured out yet.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:47.840]   And when Apple does, that's going to be a big seller, I can tell you.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.320]   Finally, I just want to, maybe we'll do this next week.
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.600]   We had that great Chirp I/O demo last week.
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.880]   And now there's a new program.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:59.240]   I don't have it, but I don't have enough people who, other people who have it.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.760]   So maybe you can get it.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.360]   It's called Vyclone, have you seen this?
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.360]   I'm not.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.640]   So the idea is everybody puts this on their iPhone.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.840]   And then you all shoot video of the same thing.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.920]   So if you're going to a concert or an event, you all are shooting different angles of the
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:12.920]   event.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.120]   And it puts all the different cuts to the Vyclone server.
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.040]   Plus it chooses one audio track.
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.800]   And it does automatically, does the camera switching and the mixing from your different
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:23.800]   angles.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:29.520]   It puts together a video of that event automatically with the same soundtrack.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.520]   But we need two things.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.160]   We need a bunch of people with Vyclone on their phone.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.880]   And then we need something to take a picture of.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.520]   Maybe we'll do it of a show at some point.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.320]   But I just love this idea.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:44.400]   By the way, you can go back and then remix, recut so you have access to all the shots.
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.800]   I think this is a really interesting idea for crowdsourcing video.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.720]   Evidently I do have it.
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:53.920]   I want to download it as it has been installed somewhere in here.
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.200]   You heard about it.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.120]   So look, this is a really bad example.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:03.360]   But this is automatically mixed from three or four people with iPhones taking pictures.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.160]   They take a single soundtrack.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.160]   Isn't that cool?
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.720]   This thing's all the video based on the sound.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.160]   It does, yeah.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.720]   So these are just sample Vyclones on the page.
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:19.120]   It would be better at a concert, I think, or an event.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:22.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.040]   I just think it's a really interesting idea.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.040]   Absolutely.
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:29.440]   Well, and especially when you think of concerts are a good one, it's easy because you have
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.200]   a continuous audience.
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.840]   That's why they're showing examples of this.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.440]   But we could do it for one of our shows.
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.840]   We could have five people in the audience shooting an act break weekly.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.760]   I mean, it just, anyway, it's free.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.120]   It's for iPhone and I don't know.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.880]   I want people to try it.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:49.880]   I would love it if that became like a new Instagram where the fact that you're at this, especially
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:51.200]   the event, let's say the--
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.200]   Dragon call.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:55.120]   Well, yeah, the opening of the Olympic Games.
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.120]   Well, here we are.
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.880]   Here is the opening of the Olympic Games, actually.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:58.880]   Here you go.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:35:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:03.760]   Foxy Boxing is just an exhibition sport, but they have great hopes for it.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.320]   What are they in with?
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.120]   Well, some big gloves, right?
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.520]   But the point is that you've got people all around the ring of this boxing match with
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:14.160]   iPhones and Vyclove.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.160]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.160]   A wedding?
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.160]   There you go.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.160]   Great for a wedding.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:22.720]   And NSFW, Kegger, whatever.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.720]   You know.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:24.720]   Another plug--
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:25.720]   Go ahead.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.720]   Sorry.
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.440]   I was going to say I was just keeping thinking about how cool it would be to be at this event.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:33.600]   But in the middle of it, I'm wondering, Gee, I wonder what it was like to see it from
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:34.600]   that other angle.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:35.600]   Exactly.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:36.600]   And there it is.
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:37.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.600]   And there it is.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.600]   And there it is.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.600]   It really is.
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.600]   It really is.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.600]   And there it is.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.600]   And there it is.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.600]   And there it is.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:52.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:53.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.600]   And there it is.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:55.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:21.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:28.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.

[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:13.600]   >> Thank you, thank you.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:20.600]   Thank you, thank you.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:27.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:30.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.600]   It's going to be a really good one to me.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.600]   It's absolutely free, except bricks.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.600]   Those aren't free.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.600]   >> One more thing before we take off.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:44.600]   I am going to do a Reddit Ask Me Anything.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.600]   Tonight, 8 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.600]   Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific time.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.600]   That is right around midnight UTC.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.600]   Now, here's the deal.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.600]   It's going to be there forever.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.600]   I'll probably keep going back every once in a while
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:58.600]   to answer questions.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.600]   The bulk of the questions and answers will start at that time,
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:05.600]   so Reddit AMAs are really fun.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.600]   I don't know what I'm going to say.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:08.600]   I am a twit.
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:09.600]   Ask me anything.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:10.600]   I don't know.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.600]   I'm hoping, actually, we get a lot of questions
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.600]   about the old tech TV days.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:15.600]   That would be a lot of fun to talk about.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.600]   But anyway, Ask Me Anything means Ask Me Anything.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.600]   I shall answer tonight on Reddit.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:24.600]   Reddit.com/r/iaamay.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:29.600]   Reddit.com/r/iaamay.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:30.600]   Hey, thanks everybody for being here.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.600]   We'll see you later.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.600]   Get back to work.
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.600]   Now, break time is over.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:44.600]   [MUSIC]
